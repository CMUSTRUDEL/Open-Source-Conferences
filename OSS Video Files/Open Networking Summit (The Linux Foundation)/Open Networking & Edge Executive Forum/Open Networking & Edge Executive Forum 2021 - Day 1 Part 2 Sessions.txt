in the afternoon session and really

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,440
humbled by the support that we got you

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,839
know tremendous like

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,000
uh i think over about a thousand people

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,679
have joined uh we're not expecting such

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,240
a high turnout but this is

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,040
really good uh it just shows that the

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,680
community is

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,279
vibrant and people want to hear from

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,560
some of the most senior leaders and

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,519
technical

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,800
execs this afternoon or evening

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,599
depending on where you are

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,480
you know we have a very powerful lineup

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,120
we have

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,600
some of the uh top end users

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
of of open source uh who are going to

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
explain

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,840
you know what they're thinking uh they

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239
are

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,399
everywhere from sort of the 18ts of the

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,600
world with andre uh

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,480
or uh super draw from walmart and or dr

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
jms from

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,320
uh from the darpa project um

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
and then we also have some of our

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,120
community p

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,800
players startups innovators and

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,960
uh you know cloud native computing

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,680
foundation so very packed afternoon

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,040
so without going into uh and spending

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,439
too much time

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,119
i want to introduce our first uh

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,720
presenter

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,799
and you know a company that has kind of

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,360
uh taken their uh their roots from

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,799
from sort of the storage world but moved

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,680
to containerization

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
cloud native and then into the telecom

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
as a virtual function

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
a company called robin.io it's a startup

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,840
here in the bay area

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
and from robin we have a an executive uh

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,280
mehran

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,240
haldipur i was the vp of tech lance to

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,439
talk about

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,640
you know how startups have been able to

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,520
uh build on this um vision of open

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,479
source

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,920
and what they have been doing to help

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,040
some of the end customers

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,520
uh of there so uh with with uh

00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:02,010
with that uh taking on marin

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,010
[Music]

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,680
part of this quite an interesting event

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,160
uh and um shared the stage with

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
some of the very um important players in

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,480
the space so i appreciate

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
the opportunity i thought maybe i'll

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,959
start

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
talking a little bit about what robin is

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,280
and does if you maybe

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,280
have the same first slide on the screen

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,680
okay so

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,040
a little bit about robin in terms of

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,959
background and how we can approach the

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,720
market

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
and what our mission and strategy has

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,640
been we basically

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,800
actually started an enterprise space for

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,000
our primary focus has been

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,239
to enable um

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,200
an open infrastructure for deep chromium

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,480
complex applications on kubernetes and

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,239
uh as arbit mentioned we started uh

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,519
providing a storage layer for kubernetes

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,760
and extended to a complete

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,760
end-to-end platform and provide

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,760
capabilities to be able to deploy

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,040
the entire cloud native infrastructure

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,879
for the entire 5g stack in production

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,959
today

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,959
uh we've built uh we believe on the

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,920
ecosystem and partnerships and alliances

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,920
and

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
being opened we we have tried to

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,760
extend our ecosystem as much as possible

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,000
and

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,840
i would say um uh robin has

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,560
been quite successful in that space and

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,400
uh we we'd be able to prove that

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,000
uh um open cloud-native infrastructures

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,799
could be

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
a vehicle to provide significant value

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,599
to

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,959
certain deployment of 5g and edge

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,000
and our mission and objective

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,760
stated is to be to enable onboarding and

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,799
live socket management of

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,319
5g energy applications on

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:15,519
seamless and easy to manage

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,600
if i may get the second slide please

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,639
so uh i wanted to kind of start the

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
conversation

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,800
by kind of talking about um

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,080
the three-pronged approach to uh and

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,600
robin's vision

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,040
uh for this space uh

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,520
we we feel that the um cloud native

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,919
and containerized infrastructure is a

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,720
very important

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,639
strategy that should be adopted for the

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,800
edge use cases we see

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,880
an infrastructure can accommodate both

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
cnfs and vnfs on a common managed

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,280
infrastructure

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,479
we think the openness is critical

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,479
being able to have an open platform

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,840
that variety of network functions could

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,360
be deployed and onboarded

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,560
on a common uh managed

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,919
environment running in kubernetes

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,000
uh is a critical strategy that would

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,759
drive softwareization and disaggregation

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,840
in the core space i think in in a more

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,039
cost effective manner

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,639
and we also think that the key value

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,080
drivers

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,600
of the open infrastructure

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,800
is to be able to also deliver automation

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,800
and orchestration layer

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,479
that is is hyper automated it

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,000
starts from the bare metal

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,120
infrastructure all about the network

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,320
functions

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,880
and creates a delivery model that

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,520
is seamless and adaptive and can

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,000
accommodate

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,560
the variety of applications uh using

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,080
open

00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,759
and standard interfaces so

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,400
this is our kind of a global view of the

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,639
mission

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,840
and an objective that we we pursued um

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,520
uh for robin so

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,840
if i may have the second next slide

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,840
please

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,199
so we think we actually think that edge

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,880
computing has

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,160
brings significant promise

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,880
to not only the operators but of the

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,919
enterprise space as well

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,919
we feel a deployment model

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,440
this kind of edge deployment model

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,280
brings continuous

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,120
availability and distributed data

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:46,639
models that could provide a much

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,199
more resiliency to the infrastructure

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
the

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,240
service delivery infrastructure for

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,599
operators

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,919
as well as enterprise customers alike

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,440
and we feel that the the fact that you

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,759
have

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,479
close low latency connections and have

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,160
the data available at the edge enables a

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,080
set of new use cases

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,520
that can deliver value to enterprise

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,800
customers including faster

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:17,120
ai that is location awareness

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,319
or automated reaction

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,919
or delivery of services around changes

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,759
in the infrastructure in a much more

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,840
seamless way

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,479
and we also think that this whole

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,479
delivery model would create an

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,880
infrastructure that gives you

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,680
optimized data placement placement you

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,720
at

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,880
one hand have high throughput low

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
latency networks that connects edge to

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,879
the data central data centers

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,840
that allows you to have more of the data

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
distributed

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,039
centrally and at the same time because

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,960
of the

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,080
network interfaces much more data could

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,160
be ingested

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,680
with the low latency at the edge and

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
analyzed at the edge

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
so you can place the data where it makes

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
sense

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,759
and deliver value from the data where it

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,759
makes sense

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
next slide please

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,160
i think one of the questions was

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,599
uh to come up with some views around

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,440
what makes uh a key success factor for

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,440
the edge

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,080
uh i think having a a thriving ecosystem

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,319
and this

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,479
is actually exactly what the open

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,440
networking

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,320
organizations uh uh are doing and

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,080
enabling

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,159
is key as they say it takes a village

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,599
is not all about you know a unified

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,519
model of

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,839
uh that could be bought from a single

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,399
vendor there needs to be a lot of

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,839
disaggregation open standards

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,519
availability to pick

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,040
the right set of functionality from the

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,560
right providers and being able to

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,839
accommodate them

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,160
in the common infrastructure

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,680
we think hybrid cloud and multi-cloud is

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,160
important

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,959
however it needs to be married with a

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,360
unified automation platform

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,360
it is essential to be able to place your

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,720
infrastructure in the cloud on-prem

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,880
and move workload between them but

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
you can't do that at the expense of

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,360
complexity at the expense of

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,399
um uh doing a lot of manual work being

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,519
able to

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,160
have dependency on the infrastructure

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,600
i think containerized and open standards

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,240
allows you to a way to

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,560
build an application stack that could

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,279
run well on-prem and the cloud

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,680
and hyper automation could be placed to

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,680
orchestrate workload across data centers

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,720
no matter where they're located i think

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,920
this would enable

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,440
and open some doors about

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,000
complete orchestrated

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,560
well-managed infrastructure that extends

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,279
from on-prem to the cloud

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,120
and enables the appropriate

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,560
placement of workload and reduces the

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,519
cost

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,839
for the service delivery across the

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,839
board

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
we also have a true believer on

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,640
containerization

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,560
we see a lot of that taking momentum in

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,560
the market today

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,160
um it is a lot of um

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,519
many of the all-around providers for

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
example are moving to containers

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,000
foundation

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,560
i think it gives you a better ecosystem

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,519
much better efficiency improved

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,720
availability

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,959
there's a number of benefits that could

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,519
be derived from containers

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,160
building a containerized foundation it

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,000
also

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,399
the only caveat here is that it needs to

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,320
be able to run

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,720
the traditional applications uh um

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
vm-based applications and so on as well

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
as containers applications in a common

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,399
infrastructure

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
to be able to

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,240
take advantage of a container deployment

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,640
with the automation on scaling healing

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,160
orchestration and so on without having

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,200
to completely

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,160
remap your application portfolio

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
and and restructure how you do services

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,920
and

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,440
i think that would enable a new set of

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,800
edge applications and a much faster

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
adoption of azure applications

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:33,120
i think there's a lot of um

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,120
best practices and and and idea

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,880
policies and procedures that have been

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,800
placed

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,240
that people that enterprise customers

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,920
are used to there's a whole new set of

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,279
operational aspects that telco

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,959
and operators are used to and iot

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,680
we bring a third set of

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,240
needs into the space so we need to think

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,040
about

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
uh especially around operations and

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,800
orchestration and management

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,160
and blend of all these practices to be

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,200
able to

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,480
achieve the kind of efficiency that is

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,160
needed to

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,720
deploy uh critical apps and manage them

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,120
at the edge at scale of thousands of

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
nodes

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,240
in a seamless manner

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,839
next slide please

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,399
uh i talked a little bit about this but

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,920
and the picture seems to be a little

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,800
very but

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,480
there are a number of uh um

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,000
infrastructure decisions that needs to

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
be made in terms of where the data

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,040
should be placed when the announce that

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,079
the analysis of the data should take

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
place

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,839
what are the um what are the best things

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
to run on the edge what are the best

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,240
thing to run in the core

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,079
how much cloud participation should be

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,040
on your infrastructure

00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:01,760
but as you see a containerization

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,600
and the fact that 5g and low latency

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,320
networking would bring

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,519
a higher support and a lower latency

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,040
interconnect

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,680
between the edge nodes and the data

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,360
center you're now going to be

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,440
um having the capability of

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,160
right place the application if you will

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
on its data and do the analysis

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,800
in the correct location with the optimum

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,480
result without having to worry about

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,600
uh bandwidth latency considerations and

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,680
opens up

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,920
those a lot of new set of applications

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,360
uh deployment policies that i think

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,519
would expand

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,920
the use of edge and edge applications in

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,600
the market today

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,600
um next slide please

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,079
you know i i think uh enterprises

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,480
especially

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,360
especially have seen the benefit of ci

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,399
cd and

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,519
how it could apply to accelerating

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,199
time to value on application deployment

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,800
we think a challenge that we should all

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,959
take on and consider

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,680
is to enable crcd processes and

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,440
procedures to more apply to the edge

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,399
be able to build a model

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,880
that fast application delivery could

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,680
could

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,639
could exist in in a complex network like

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,920
this

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,519
uh the same processes that enterprise

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,920
customers have been benefiting

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,880
for onboarding and acceleration of

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,560
deployment and customization

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,680
and um additional service delivery

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,040
models

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,160
uh and do it in a fast manner that cicd

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,040
has been delivering uh as a promise

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,240
it should should apply to more of attend

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,120
use cases

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,199
i mean if you start looking at um

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,199
infrastructure point of view

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,920
things about smart cities smart

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,199
factories smart farming

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,360
all the way to things like content

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,560
distribution uh there are

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,560
a large set of opportunities for

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,839
incremental revenue generation and use

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,079
cases

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,000
and to be able to monetize all these and

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,959
get to a point that

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,079
we get to a fast faster 5g deployment at

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,440
the same time

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:19,680
more more edge applications are deployed

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,880
crcd processes and infrastructure

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,880
would be an important

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:32,240
contributor i think uh to this uh

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,959
journey uh

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,959
next slide please

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,759
i wanted to kind of talk a little bit

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,600
about uh robin belief

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,600
in open strategy source strategy and

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,880
what our approach has been

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,079
and so on uh we are basically

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,480
uh first started by

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,000
ensuring that we have a complete

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,880
kubernetes-based strategy

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,199
and we don't touch a single code of

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,399
kubernetes anything that we do

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,759
that depends on kubernetes all the apis

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
are open source

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,360
the way our storage talks through

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
kubernetes if src and eye level talks

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,959
kubernetes is a standard

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,959
standard any application can run on

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,320
kubernetes will run on robin

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,199
we we publish we are published uh

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,680
our apis and are going to continue to do

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,560
so

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,120
uh with the additional capabilities

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:30,160
around md cap our orchestration platform

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,160
uh later in the summer uh and

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,920
we tried to build a model that

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:41,360
um different um elements

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,480
and of robin itself for example uh could

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,680
be

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,360
adopted for different use cases by

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,440
different partnerships and we

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
build a number of those partnerships to

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,920
try to extend

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,360
expand the openness of the platform

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,519
our storage layer is completely um open

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,880
we can run on any kubernetes platform on

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,759
any cloud

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,319
we are making more and more strides

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,120
toward

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,400
our uh cloud native platform to make it

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,480
uh more adaptable

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,480
and uh to run on any kubernetes

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,720
distribution and so on

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,839
and uh we're planning to publish our api

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,039
so i think

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,079
openness of what we do understand the

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,039
need for

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,079
enhancing certain capabilities of the

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,439
open source

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,679
community tools and provide production

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,280
level support on them and so on

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,600
and there's a business to be had to do

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,559
so but i think keeping the environment

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,679
open

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,520
is essential uh

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:45,360
uh done

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,360
as essential strategy for robin

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,880
i do have a question uh robert should i

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,760
just answer it or should you want to

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,760
wait till the end

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,960
i think we may run out of times if you

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
could wrap it up yeah

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,840
okay sure can we go to the next slide

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,840
please so we can

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
okay so these are some of our business

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,919
priorities in terms of where we're

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,000
taking the platform

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,760
uh enhancing our ecosystem partnership

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,600
is key for us we wanted to get to a

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,480
point that

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,160
we have more and more from application

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,240
to infrastructure side up

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
we're working with the oems on hardware

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
on the on

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,880
on the different edge applications for

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,720
cdn and other other use cases

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,200
and be enhancing our hyper automation

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,840
platform to be able to

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,440
be as open as possible and be available

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,320
to

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,000
extend its use case around orchestration

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,799
and lifecycle automation

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,160
that applies to a variety to your

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,240
workloads and across

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,760
variety of infrastructure including

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,320
cloud

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,320
next slide

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,360
oh keep going yeah wow sorry

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,120
okay these are um some of the technology

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,000
priorities we've taken on and

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,720
i can make this the last slide basically

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,880
uh

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,200
enhancing our ability to run state

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,679
relapse on kubernetes has been one

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,280
key priority for robin we have number of

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,120
number of enhancements we've done

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
to create the most highest performance

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
storage platform

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,760
that supports very complex applications

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
including things like oracle rack and

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,080
sap

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,320
to give you an example enhance our

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,280
ability to run apps on the edge

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,120
is another priority to be able to kind

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,160
of extend the networking requirements

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,280
and so on

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,960
to be able to run

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,200
applications that require network

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,400
accelerations for example or require

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,400
things like sriv and

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,520
enhancing those capabilities to be able

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,520
to extend what could run at the edge

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,559
we are expanding our orchestration layer

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,320
to do more hybrid cloud focus to be

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,160
we think that the answers would be

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,080
a combination of on-prem and cloud

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,320
always and

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,120
we build mobility functions within the

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,679
platform

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,559
so you can take an applications from one

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,120
platform

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,159
on-prem and run it in any cloud and

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,600
without that

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,840
a complete disregard to the

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,440
infrastructure peculiarities

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,280
of when you run your application and i

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,640
think that's an important part of this

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,679
strategy

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,720
uh and obviously um

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,840
uh being able to run both vms and

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,799
containers

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,559
on the interest common infrastructure as

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,200
efficiently

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,799
and orchestrate them together would open

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
a lot of doors in bringing a lot of new

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,840
applications

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,360
to containerized infrastructure

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,679
platforms

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,840
and we also think that beyond the

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,520
instantiation and management

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,880
building platform that does day two

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,760
operations

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,679
is also quite essential in making the

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,760
core diploma successful

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,720
so i think when i pass it on to you i

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,840
think i'm

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,039
no i i think that's fantastic

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,000
and i know um you know there there were

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,080
a couple of questions

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,919
uh unfortunately we're out of time we'll

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,679
probably take that offline

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,960
uh just want to you know make sure that

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,559
we are on track

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,159
for for the rest of the schedule so

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,600
really thank you maron for doing this

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
okay sorry i'm running a little late i

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,159
tried no no thank you

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,600
all right so with that uh we move to our

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,559
next speaker who is

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,280
uh one of the well-known leaders in the

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,080
open source

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,720
cloud native industry uh our own uh

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,930
priyanka sharma who's the gm for cncf

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:37,200
so with that priyanka

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:39,679
[Music]

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,039
i am delighted to be here today thanks

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,760
for having me

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,159
i hope everyone do is doing extremely

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,559
well

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,480
we're all very close to the end of this

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,200
pandemic and i hope you're feeling that

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
excitement

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,880
as i am right now speaking of pandemic

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,280
that's what my talk today is going to be

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,840
about so i'd like to start my slides

00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
please

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,159
awesome great so today's agenda

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
um we're going to talk a little bit

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,480
about cloud native

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,000
in the pre-pandemic era how the cloud

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,520
computing and cloud native rose

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,280
up you've been obviously hearing a ton

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,960
about cloud in context of the edge in

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,159
the previous talk and i'm sure before

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,039
that as well

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,000
um we'll talk about how cloud native

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,280
accelerated

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,960
and then during the pandemic and finally

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,880
what can we look forward to in the

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,520
post-pandemic era and what that means

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,320
for you

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,679
folks who are focused on

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,200
telecommunications on edge

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,240
computing and the surrounding industry

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,720
um next slide please

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,840
so pre-pandemic era rise of cloud and

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
cloud native next slide

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,000
when we think about the biggest trends

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,799
in our industry right

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,880
the big one in my opinion was going from

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,640
virtualization to cloud native

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,960
in 2001 is when vms became a thing

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,159
uh and that kept growing it kept getting

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,640
bigger within

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,720
infrastructure as a service passed and

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,039
then in 2010 is when

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,000
open source really started making moves

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,559
in the world of infrastructure

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,320
in 2013 i think it was momentous because

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,360
with the rise of docker we had

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,919
containers

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,760
suddenly people could could break their

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,520
large monolithic applications into

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,559
microservices and put them in their own

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,720
containers

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:31,120
excellent and then in 2015 with the open

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,200
sourcing of kubernetes from google

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,799
we had a container open so an open

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,000
source container orchestrator to

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,400
dynamically orchestrate

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,159
these containers and optimize our

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,559
resource utilization

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,159
this was the beginning of cloud native

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,279
and the beginning of a

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,559
really exciting journey next slide the

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,279
cloud native compute

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,039
computing foundation built a global

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,880
community around the momentum of the

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,240
kubernetes project and added

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,480
many more surrounding it and we

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,480
built a critical mass by hosting events

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,279
and activities and

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,480
engaging with all parts of the group our

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
strategy paid off

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,480
when if you look at this um these

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,320
numbers here these are pre-pandemic

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,279
numbers of people who attended our

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,960
flagship

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,760
kubecon cloud native con in person so 23

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,320
000 people

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:25,520
in 2019 next slide

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,480
overall it was a very frothy exciting

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,360
time we were

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,720
having growth all around fastest growing

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,480
open source community in the world

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,080
all major cloud providers became

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,600
platinum members and

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,240
we hosted the largest open source

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,960
conferences this

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,480
was unprecedented momentum for any open

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,880
source community

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,679
next slide as we grew

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,960
and then were suddenly hit by a pandemic

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,840
there was quite questions

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,440
concerns what does this mean for cloud

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,559
native what does this mean for this

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,600
ecosystem

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,400
next slide and

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,520
to share with you how things have gone

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,799
i'd like to talk about

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,600
hobit in general our most

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,559
hated favorite topic i would say kobit

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,120
19.

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,159
what did we learn with kobe 19 a lot of

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,440
trends that were

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,440
slowly percolating really accelerated

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,200
we learned to work from home events

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,400
became virtual we recently

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,159
last year in um october hosted our

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,679
november sorry hosted kubecon cloud

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,080
nativecon north america

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,360
with over 23 000 attendees in just one

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,640
event compared to

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,760
23 000 and 20 uh 2019 for all of them

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,799
put together

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,600
um and now we have one more coming in

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,080
may with a cube contact native on eu

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,400
which will

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,080
also be virtual as we look forward to

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,679
events we are always going to do hybrid

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,200
virtual will always be part of our

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,600
strategy

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,520
similarly restaurants had to learn to

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,320
take online orders and then

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,400
on the very other send us as other end

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,200
of the technology complexity spectrum we

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
needed

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,080
privacy respecting contact tracing

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,080
within three months because of cobit

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,360
mrna technology needed to produce a

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,720
vaccine stack

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,360
so things really speeded up for what was

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,000
needed

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,240
from technology in this pandemic era

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,480
thinking about all that do you remember

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,480
when digital transformation was a

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,279
buzzword

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,799
with coed 19 digital transformation has

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,559
become the mainstay

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,120
of most companies before it was

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,880
something to aim for to think about

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,799
with the challenges of covet with the

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,360
world going virtual

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,360
every company has been jumping in a lot

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,559
of companies i speak to day to day

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,720
they tell me oh it is within covet

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,640
19 that we have hired majority of our

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,279
cloud native staff it is within this

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,840
time frame that we have modernized

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,000
the pressures are totally different now

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,760
next slide

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,360
so covet 19 because of these

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,279
pressures to go virtual have accelerated

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,640
cloud native there's generally been a

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,760
market shift in innovation

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,520
open source has become the mainstay for

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,200
a lot of um infrastructure technologies

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,880
people are using open source much more

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,679
than legacy iit vendors

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,000
even before the pandemic it was expected

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,760
that

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,279
two-thirds of enterprises will be

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,720
prolific software product

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,279
producers by 2025 with over 90

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,840
new apps cloud native everything like

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,720
this has

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,600
accelerated with the coronavirus

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,159
outbreak

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,159
people 60 percent of the respondents of

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,720
the state of the cloud report said

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,399
that cloud usage will exceed prior plans

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,640
because of the pandemic

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,080
i mean we don't need stats and numbers

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,000
and reports to tell us that

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,600
think of our own lives as i said we're

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,640
ordering food online we're ordering

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,000
groceries

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,480
we are doing online banking the more we

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,200
can do from our computer from our home

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,960
that we prefer that so what does this

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,520
all mean for the cncf

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,120
well next slide i'm proud to tell you

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,279
that covet truly accelerated cncf

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,559
in membership we have 20 percent growth

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,480
today with 612 members compared to 2019.

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,640
in contributors these are people who are

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,279
producing code for the many projects

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,480
that are in cncf we have a 46

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:25,440
growth with over 118

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,080
000 people from around the world 173

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,159
countries

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,279
plus by the way who are contributing to

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,120
our projects

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,480
and our projects have grown by 93

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,399
to 85 today we started this conversation

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,080
talking about kubernetes and how that

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,200
brought on the cloud native

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,960
uh revolution there are 84 other

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,760
projects supporting kubernetes

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,760
in that ecosystem today next slide

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,120
telcos and other edge providers

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,000
understand this value

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,240
i'm proud to tell you that at t joined

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,799
us

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,720
as a platinum member recently as does

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,880
cox communications which is

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,000
another telecommunications provider in

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,600
the us

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,320
both are making waves with cloud native

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,799
on telcos

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
and cloud native on the edge this

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,840
momentum

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
next slide why are all these people

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,960
interested why is so much growth

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,120
happening

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,039
at the end of the day i'm so proud to

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,080
tell you that it's because of the

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,159
diversity

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,159
the resilience that our diversity of

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,440
team cloud native brings

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,480
we are today 6.5 million cloud native

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,159
developers

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:38,480
which is up by 1.8 million from q2 2019

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,399
2.7 million use kubernetes and 60

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,840
of back-end developers now use

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,399
containers

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,080
the more our numbers increase the more

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,320
that people contribute

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,360
the better more secure our software

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,320
becomes

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,080
it also means there's enough talent to

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,240
go around to help end users to help

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,960
telco providers to help

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,840
edge companies adopt cloud native

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,960
technologies

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,480
into their practice our numbers

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,399
across geographies technologies genders

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,159
and other demographic demographics is

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,520
our biggest strength

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,919
even when it comes to people

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,840
self-learning educating getting bigger

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,120
and better in cloud native the numbers

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,120
are increasing

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:24,480
today 70 000 developers out there

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,600
are certified as either kubernetes admin

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,640
or kubernetes application developers or

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,000
kubernetes

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,120
security specialists these 70 000 people

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
are out there

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,880
ready to help anyone making their

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,919
digital transformation cloud native

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,159
journey

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,640
our diversity powered resilience is what

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:47,039
makes us ubiquitous in today's

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,120
modern technology world next slide

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,120
there's a lot of projects that support

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,039
this as i said and you can feel free to

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,799
take a look at all of our logos over

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,000
here the slides will be available to you

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,480
next slide

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,720
um you see a bunch of projects in our

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,120
sandbox as well which is a new

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,120
uh type of project that we have released

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,440
in 2020

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,519
next slide as i mentioned the world's

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,039
largest cloud and software companies are

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,960
part of our ecosystem

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,240
and you can take a look at them there

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,559
there's also a link to

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,080
check out our end users we enjoy the

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,399
largest end user community

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,279
of any ecosystem out there any

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,600
foundation ecosystem out there with 145

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,600
plus

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,159
next slide um and finally

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,919
cloud native ecosystem is frothy as ever

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,159
there's so many acquisitions there's so

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,760
many new startups who join us

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,600
check out our landscape and the links

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,159
provided to get more insight

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,159
next slide

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:48,240
all of this is to tell you that

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,360
covet 19 was not a blip in our existence

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,320
covert 19 was game changer if you think

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,880
about world war

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,720
ii people refer to the period before and

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,840
after as pre-war and post war

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,159
respectively

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,120
that's because society fundamentally

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,679
changed because of this war

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,960
i expect that the generations to come

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,080
will think similarly

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,000
about the pre-kobit 19 and postcode 19

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,200
eras

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,279
so with that in mind next slide

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,880
what does the post-pandemic error look

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,519
like

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,960
i adventure that cloud native is going

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,279
to be the building block of

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,399
the coming times next slide

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,120
when we think about what is coming we

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,519
have

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,600
as i said everybody is hastened to be

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,640
online everyone's gone through this

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,120
are going through the digital

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,840
transformation as fast as possible

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,919
alongside that the num amount of data

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,600
generated from our devices the amount of

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,159
information available

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,640
and the modern compute at the edge is

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,000
creating

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,559
information and with ever smarter neural

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,600
networks and decentralization

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,000
we are going to be able to build

00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,880
experiences

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,080
for human beings technologies that are

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,240
nuanced for

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,200
their specific needs and taste so that

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,519
it's a much richer experience

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,480
all this information that's available

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,640
will be harnessed

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,360
to create the next generation of our

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,120
technological movement

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,360
putting together big data putting

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,000
together uh compute at the edge

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,640
putting together all of this stuff needs

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,240
to happen

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,080
all the while delighting customers in

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,760
the way they're used to

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,799
and that's something cloud native knows

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,919
best so the modern era of technology can

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,919
only be ushered in

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,240
when backed by cloud native principles

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,320
and cloud native people

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,840
let's talk a little bit about how telcos

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,240
and edge companies are thinking about

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,720
this

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,720
next slide

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,559
telcos are actively adopting cloud

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,720
native today

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,720
they want better resource efficiency

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,200
better resiliency and availability

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,679
and they want most importantly higher

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,640
development velocity next slide

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,399
um there are a lot of tools available

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,080
there's a telcom user group where folks

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,240
come together and discuss

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,600
leadership and learn from each other and

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,760
then we have created

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,159
the cnf working group or the cloud

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,320
native network function working group

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,359
which helps define what does cloud

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,480
native look like

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,879
in a network function and it relies upon

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,040
the cnf test suite and testbed

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,040
and as i told you last time we spoke to

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,399
watch this space for more information

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,480
next slide i do have progress to report

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,399
the cnf working group is defining what

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
makes a telco application cloud native

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,679
we have best practices that can be

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,320
adopted by cnf

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,879
developers and operators these write-ups

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,359
of best practices use cases requirements

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,040
gap analyses and similar documents are

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,200
going to be available

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
and this is the beauty here the

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,200
individuals and organizations

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,240
can choose to incorporate cloud native

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,720
best practices

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,359
along with other standards a great

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,359
example

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,640
would be a company choosing to use both

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,400
cloud native and

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,040
at cnfv specs we are here to make you

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,520
succeed

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,040
to help you win and that's what the cnf

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,680
group is working on

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,480
next slide when it comes to edge

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,800
computing

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,680
there's a lot less lots of challenges we

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,079
face there's

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,440
millions of locations billions of

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,920
devices

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,640
and really small margins for error and

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,400
profit

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,599
we have reduced control constrained

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,440
resources risky devices and locations

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,520
limited connectivity and delays and

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,400
disconnections

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,359
well next slide cloud native is here to

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,079
help you

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,160
kubernetes was as you all know born for

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,079
massive data centers but it is now

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
extended just like linux was for

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,160
embedded

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,560
to have projects and support available

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,599
for this new world of edge computing

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,040
i've listed some

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,000
oh sorry i said next slide

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,480
yes so kubernetes as i said has been for

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,480
uh

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
was born in massive data centers but is

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,320
ready for

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,760
extension into the edge just like linux

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,119
did for embedded

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,800
there's a bunch of projects that i've

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,839
listed here that are already happening

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,720
that are in

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,000
cncf that are ready and able to help you

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,800
as you go to the edge

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,640
and bring cloud native with it i

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,800
encourage you to have your developers

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,640
check these out i encourage you to get

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,560
them participating there's a lot of

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,760
value here that's just waiting to be

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,599
utilized by you

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,599
as it is already being utilized by

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,880
others

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,760
so a next slide with that said

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,079
there it's obvious that a lot's going on

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,599
i highly encourage you to get involved

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,560
get involved with team cloud native

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,640
today

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,079
we have a kubernetes iot edge working

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,560
group that meets bi-weekly

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,560
so there's a link here to join the list

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,119
i already mentioned the cnf working

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,400
group

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,160
uh it meets every monday at 1600 utc and

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,280
there's a link

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,480
finally let's ourselves get educated and

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,800
teach each other

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,480
we i urge you to fill out our edge micro

00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,359
survey micro means no more than eight

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,560
questions

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,000
um and it's not it's not you don't have

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,720
to write the answers it's all multiple

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,359
choice

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,000
um i encourage you to come and fill this

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,000
survey out

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
so that we can release results of what's

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,640
happening in

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,640
at the edge with cloud native next slide

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,440
i truly believe the future is bright

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,680
team cloud native is a community of

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,440
doers you've seen that with the momentum

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,839
we bring to everything we do

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,520
with the excitement the passion the

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,960
technical brilliance that we bring to

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,800
everything

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,320
that's why we're being expanded into

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,839
various technology and industry

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,599
verticals

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,680
kubecon cloud nativecon that's coming

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,720
soon has so many co-located events that

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,240
just

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,079
show off this brilliance of the

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,359
community we have everything from cloud

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,400
native rust day

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,680
to kubernetes ai day all these things

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,240
are happening people are working on

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,839
things and

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,040
end users are benefiting they are

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,800
thriving they're growing they're

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,880
contributing back

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,000
this is an ecosystem that is going to

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,040
last

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,720
next slide if you want to get more

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,119
involved and understand more of cloud

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,440
native for telco and the edge i have two

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,839
specific co-located events at kubecon

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,680
that i would recommend for you

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,280
i would recommend attending kubernetes

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,240
on edge day and

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,160
which is on may 4th and magma day which

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,760
is about a project that uh arpith has

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,119
probably told you about already

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:29,520
that has just entered linux foundation

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,440
which is happening on may 3rd next slide

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,520
to get deep more deeply connected to get

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,839
more involved you gotta be at cloud

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,839
cubecon cloud nativecon come here as i

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,000
expound deeper into my thoughts on the

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,599
post-pandemic era and the role cloud

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,480
natives community is playing going to

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,839
play in it

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,320
we are going live may 4th through 7

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,280
2021.

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,359
and i was able to finagle a code for you

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,240
from the events team to get a discounted

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,720
price

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,640
uh of 50 dollars so feel free to use

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,079
this code feel free to disperse this

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,400
amongst your teams

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,599
so they can also benefit from it use the

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,160
registration link

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,880
and join us there i really hope to see

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,320
you again

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,960
very soon stay in next slide thank you

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,800
very much

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,560
feel free to reach out to me anytime i

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,599
would love to welcome you into team

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,480
cloud native

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,119
and work with you for innovation

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,160
tomorrow

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,160
day after and ever more to come thanks

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,920
all right thank you thank you priyanka

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,400
and that was good i think i picked up

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,160
three very important uh messages

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,839
from your talk for the for the

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,480
networking and edge users right number

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,680
one

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,280
as we move from sort of vm to long-term

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,440
containers there's a

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,119
there's a hybrid model that is running

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,960
right now both in the infrastructure and

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,160
the applications but you want to think

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,160
cloud native first so

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,240
check there i think the telecom and edge

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,200
users absolutely love that the second

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,320
one is

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,680
as we have tools within cncf on

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,560
vnf cnf testbed uh as well as the

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,920
working group

00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,880
i think the collaboration between anuket

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,839
which is lf networking projects and the

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,880
integration is

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,640
is very tight and uh is being worked so

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,640
that you know it's seamless across

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,319
the technologies yeah and then finally

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,760
on the edge i think um

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,520
you know several of the elf edge

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,839
blueprints or crano et cetera

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,960
they they build on kubernetes right so i

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,720
think uh

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,560
i think the collaboration i i really

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,839
welcome and and appreciate the

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,960
collaboration between our two

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,200
organizations

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,400
in the community so thank you for for

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,319
supporting that

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,440
absolutely it's been amazing we work

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,480
together folks

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,920
pretty much every week and the result is

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,760
that your lives get easier

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,760
[Laughter]

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,680
all right thank you very much uh and

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,760
again reminder to everybody

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,119
uh you know if you need to ask questions

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,760
these are live sessions

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,400
uh there's a q a button on your session

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,880
please

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,319
kind of type it in and we will take

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,760
these right after the

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,119
after this session so thank you very

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,160
much uh priyanka

00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,040
all right okay so now we have

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,680
three end users that are going to talk

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,760
about

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,200
you know what they see in open source

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,480
and how they see

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,480
evolution for their particular

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,880
domain if you may i'm just use using the

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,800
word uh generically

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,480
and we're going to start off first with

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,000
uh one of the

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,800
the the smartest and the most uh

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,680
intelligent person i have met in the in

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,920
the past

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,720
several decades i mean ever since the

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,119
bell research days

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,359
dr jonathan smith he is at darpa right

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,880
now since 2017 i think and he's also

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,440
a professor at university of

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,000
pennsylvania uh he leads

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,960
several several projects across both

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,839
universities

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,880
and darpa you know dod you know many

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,040
many things but

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,880
more importantly he's a technologist and

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,440
a strategist

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,599
and we recently announced the

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,040
collaboration between the uh

00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,319
derpa dod and linux foundation to allow

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,160
for

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,400
open source to be utilized for uh

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,839
you know applications and innovation in

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,960
the government space

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,440
and again keep in mind you know uh

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,160
this is this is a very interesting use

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,000
case

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,359
uh you know i won't call this as an

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,160
industry or a vertical like a

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,720
manufacturer

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,920
but it is it is a real end user that's

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,440
building on

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,720
what you all have done so without any uh

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,160
further uh delay i would love to welcome

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,160
dr jonathan smith

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,520
i think that what i'd like to emphasize

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,040
is that the primary locus for

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,920
collaboration

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,240
with with the linux foundation has been

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,920
a project that we call

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:59,040
ops 5g it's

00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:02,319
open programmable secure 5g so

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,720
the name tells you everything

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:09,920
um it's open

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:13,839
source the

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,560
focus is security

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,720
and the particular problem that we're

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,160
trying to wrestle with

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,079
is the advances some of them being the

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,520
programmability

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:31,040
of the uh edge

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:35,119
and some of them being programmability

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,720
of the um infrastructure

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:43,839
for example the uh the um

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,839
uh virtual functions so

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:51,280
what we did um

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:55,440
was we we looked at

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,880
how to

00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:03,280
deal with the problem of securing

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,280
5g so

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,200
our analysis showed that there were

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,480
going to be hardware

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,440
and software elements

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,040
but the hardware was going to be barely

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,839
generic

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,030
um so the locus

00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,160
of um

00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:28,000
[Music]

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,560
for example security security threats at

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,920
the edge or security threats

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,960
in the um in the core were

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,480
were all going to be in the software

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,000
um and that's that's not surprising

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,680
you know there's there's a lot of

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,800
complexity there

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,319
and um there's a lot of people with

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,760
expertise

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,680
now um i think

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:59,920
that the the fact that we're

00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:03,119
driving so much functionality

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:07,520
um out to out to

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:10,480
phones uh and edge devices

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,240
tells us that we you know we have to

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,839
protect them

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,560
so what we did with ops 5g

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,440
and we're delighted to be working with

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,280
um

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:26,560
the linux foundation and the larger

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:30,000
open source community because

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,200
um there there is a

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,040
a very strong

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:41,359
case to be made for transparency

00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:44,079
as perhaps the most fundamental um

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,440
advantage in security because for

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,440
example

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:53,119
one one issue that we can

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,000
can can get traction on is we can get

00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,599
the

00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,880
um we can get the source code

00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:04,240
we can use various analytic tools that r

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,359
d and practitioners

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,400
have and analyze it and we can be

00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:14,319
confident that it's running

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:17,200
using integrity checks so our our model

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,200
was to

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:25,680
try to transform as as

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:28,880
darpa does um transform the ecosystem

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:33,520
for 5g um

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,520
we we had done some work

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:44,480
and we identified linux foundation

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:48,160
as um you know an ideal way

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:52,240
to do what we call transition

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:55,680
and transition means that it reaches

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:59,839
mobile network operators vendors

00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:03,200
etc so um

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:06,800
in my slides i i you know i illustrate a

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:09,920
you know a flow um

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,680
from left to right as as we go along the

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,880
timeline

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:18,210
from basically a

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,599
box shipped with um

00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:24,800
[Music]

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:28,319
with customized opaque software systems

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,680
where we don't know what's going on to

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:36,160
community built software systems um

00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:39,200
perhaps with advanced elements

00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,400
that anybody can look at and

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,319
um you know they they see can

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,920
address other threats that might exist

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:53,920
so um so

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:58,319
the ops 5g program is structured

00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:02,079
into four technical areas

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:05,599
the four technical areas are focused

00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,559
um i'll tell you about the the last

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,599
three

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:12,160
first because they're very 5g

00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,119
focused and and the first one is

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,240
somewhat more

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,240
open source focused

00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:25,359
the 5g focused

00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:29,359
pieces are um we're focused on

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:33,280
iot devices and what we're trying to do

00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:36,720
is use the um

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,800
you know the some the the the somewhat

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:44,160
um imprecise

00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:47,280
um uh

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,079
zero trust model when

00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,680
when we when we looked at that our

00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,319
interpretation of it was

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,319
it was basically a way to talk about

00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:00,240
least privilege

00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,960
and um systems people are familiar with

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,119
that

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,720
and the idea is that you only open the

00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,520
interfaces

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,599
that you need uh for the task that

00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,119
you're doing at the time

00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:16,480
so you know we've we've we've got

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,839
work uh that we've chartered and

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:24,319
paid for and gotten started on

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:27,359
uh iot software systems

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:29,680
that are intended to be zero trust

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,200
there in some cases they have very cool

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,559
edge properties

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,599
um you know for example uh one of the

00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,720
one of the projects has the notion

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,720
that you can do

00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,319
some of the cryptographic work on the

00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,520
mech um

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:51,440
to you know to offload work on

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:54,559
on the actual edge device um

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:58,079
the um the

00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:01,839
the the concern

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:05,680
uh with programmability is that

00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:08,480
um if you look at

00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,400
if if you look at many examples that

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,920
we've seen throughout history

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:17,839
programmability is something that is

00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:22,800
two-faced you know it um

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:25,839
it offers opportunity uh as

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,160
you know in basically creating

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,640
exciting new systems and applications

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:35,680
but it also potentially

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:38,079
because of the complexity introduced by

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,520
the the software machine plus the

00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,800
hardware machine

00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:46,720
can can introduce

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:50,559
errors so one of our

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:54,319
one of our focal points in

00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:57,520
uh in t83 is secure

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:59,200
slices and so what that does is that

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,800
focuses on

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:06,559
um you know our our view of how

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:09,630
to uh isolate

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,280
slices from from each other um

00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:15,359
[Music]

00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,400
ta4 is focused on um

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:21,520
programmability again the real

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:25,119
objective of ta4

00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:28,640
is to try to shift

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:32,319
uh shift the model of

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:36,240
um of programmability to one

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:40,240
where the the programs

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:43,520
are constrained by the infrastructure

00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:46,640
to um

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:50,480
to do good stuff and

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,200
um not do bad stuff so to give you an

00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,359
example

00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,119
of of an approach that you might use

00:51:53,359 --> 00:52:00,640
there you might use formal methods

00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:03,680
to ensure that um

00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,160
that that code has been verified you

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,760
might

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,760
um you you might

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:16,839
mark it with a signature

00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:20,960
uh what we've done in ta4 is we focused

00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:24,000
on um a challenge

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,599
which is to try to defend

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,119
against a trillion node

00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:33,119
mirai botnet um

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,880
because there's been a lot of

00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,839
speculation that we

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,400
that we could actually get to a trillion

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,240
iot

00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:45,440
devices so if if that occurs

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,720
and um you know we we have something of

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,640
that scale

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,559
um it will not be a pretty picture

00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,880
so you know we've set a stretch goal

00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,760
like that um

00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,960
and uh you know you know we'll be

00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,559
testing

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,079
aggressively um you know to see if

00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,319
people can meet that

00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,000
um and i'm gonna finish up quickly

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,800
because i understand that

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,760
i understand that um that we're over

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,839
soon

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,800
but uh one of the one of the craziest

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,160
ideas and

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:24,559
and you know we we do crazy ideas

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:27,599
um that we're trying is we realized

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:30,720
that um

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:34,160
given the the portability

00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,680
the generality and the code quality

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:40,960
of open source software it sometimes

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:44,559
takes the open source community

00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:48,480
longer to get to the polished

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:51,599
product that that you know that you

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,359
that you want to ship um and

00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:58,480
one of the main problems with

00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:01,520
telecom software

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,240
is that for interoperability

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,079
it has to be built according to

00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:10,319
standards

00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:13,599
and so um we took a look at

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:18,480
the process of moving from

00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:22,640
a standard to working code

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:25,839
and we're betting

00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:29,920
in ta1 technical area 1

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:33,280
that the 3gpp

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,839
and other standards documents are not

00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:41,119
finnegan's wake and

00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:44,079
um uh what we mean by

00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,599
by that statement is that the standards

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,200
documents

00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:52,640
are um

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:56,880
using a specialized vocabulary they're

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:59,839
they're formatted and structured

00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,839
in a way that

00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,520
should allow natural language processing

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,319
techniques

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,760
to get some traction so we're taking a

00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:13,599
run

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:17,280
at building software systems

00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:21,119
that will essentially

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:24,240
read read standards documents

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,200
and produce either intermediate forms of

00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,799
code

00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,839
or perhaps if if we

00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:35,599
are as successful as i hope we are

00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:39,040
um we'll we'll produce uh um

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:43,119
big chunks of working uh c

00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:48,559
c plus plus or other code

00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:50,960
so uh with that i think i'm done

00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,160
if i'm if i'm paying attention to that

00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,280
no no no i

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:58,000
that that is fine i mean uh jms

00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,920
we were just so intensely listening to

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,680
your thoughts and research but

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,440
uh if you can hang on we may have a

00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,119
couple of questions as well coming from

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:11,280
absolutely you know i basically i i i

00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:13,680
you know i could talk forever on this

00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,240
pleasure working with the linux

00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,920
foundation and the linux community

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,839
um you know i i started at bell labs in

00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,839
81 as you mentioned so

00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,200
you know i've been i've been with unix

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,520
and uh

00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,280
networks for a long time and you know

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,319
it's great to see how

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,760
it's great to see where we are yep

00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:38,240
no i think i think that's fair

00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,200
yeah no i think it is very refreshing to

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,319
hear

00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:44,240
uh you know the the research you know

00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,920
like true research versus you know

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,799
development and deployment right the

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,920
true research

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:51,839
being uh a fundamental pillar of i mean

00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,319
it was always a pillar of darpa right

00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,280
and

00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,200
and and dod uh but you know

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,640
collaborating with universities as you

00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,599
as you're showing you know some of the

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,200
top-notch uh

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,960
cs departments computer science

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,760
departments and

00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,839
collaborating with all the innovation

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,559
that has happened in open source

00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,359
uh at the underlying layer whether it's

00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,559
networking

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:17,200
5g edge iot etc and then

00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,880
you know contributing back into you know

00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,240
the the community from a security

00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,440
perspective so

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,799
i think the the the intention that you

00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,160
communicated you know we really

00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,839
appreciate it because

00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,200
at the end of the day i think everybody

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,520
benefits right the

00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,960
government benefits as a user obviously

00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,280
but the open source community

00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,799
benefits because it's more secure uh

00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,280
telcos benefit right and

00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:41,119
and i think that cycle is i think what

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,720
uh we really appreciate so

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,400
there are there are a couple of

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,880
questions uh

00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,599
uh that have come in and again for those

00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,920
of you who are

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,960
who are uh you know not yet familiar

00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,040
with this uh

00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,559
platform you know there's a click q a

00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,640
button on the right

00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,680
of your session just just or i think

00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,400
it's on the top

00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,440
uh just send the questions over but uh

00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,960
the question is

00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:08,000
you know if if you implement standards

00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,040
uh obviously on the edge

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,040
and and core uh

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,520
how secure will it be so that people

00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,760
cannot infiltrate the 5g networks right

00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,280
if there's any backdoor manufacturing

00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,319
things that have happened

00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,720
uh and and at and at the scale of

00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,760
uh i think what dod won five years ago

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,480
right so

00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,200
i i i think from from a perspective of

00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,440
security

00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,400
how how do you see the the next you know

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,839
couple of years

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,839
using this strategy

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:54,240
okay here we go so um

00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:58,160
what i see happening is

00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:01,359
um so so my view of security

00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:04,720
is that

00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:07,119
is the

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,119
the right stuff happening at the right

00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:13,119
place at the right time

00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:16,839
and the wrong stuff not happening

00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:19,280
so you could

00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:23,280
imagine that uh

00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:26,559
consumer devices might be

00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,960
optimized for ease of setup because it's

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,839
very costly to have personnel

00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,280
on the phone so you make the device very

00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:37,440
promiscuous

00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,760
um it has lots of ports open um

00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,640
you know it reaches out in bluetooth and

00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,680
everything else

00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:47,119
trying to uh

00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:50,559
you know auto setup um now that

00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,960
that turns out to be that turns out to

00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,400
be

00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:58,960
a great model for

00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:02,559
um not taking any service calls etc

00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,350
but it is not a good model

01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,680
for um

01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:09,040
[Music]

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:11,119
having you know a giant attack surface

01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,559
because if there's one bug in any of

01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,319
those ports that

01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:17,119
have been opened you've you've got a

01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:20,720
problem so

01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,720
when you know when i think of

01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,280
what i think of the way things are done

01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,440
today

01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,520
um and it's probably the way that you

01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,799
have your home set up

01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:36,720
um i i have a

01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:40,799
gateway and and the gateway

01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:45,760
um is my boundary between

01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:48,160
my personal policy and the policy

01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,599
of the network infrastructure that i

01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,280
connect to

01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,280
so i think that um

01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:01,520
i think that what um

01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,799
we're talking about with 5g and the edge

01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,680
devices

01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:07,200
is in some sense we're moving some

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,319
functionality

01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:14,160
um and some of the role

01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:16,000
uh for securing things into the public

01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:19,280
network

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,559
and um it's

01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:26,000
it's it's not quite the same thing

01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:30,079
excuse me as the um

01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:34,640
as as the model uh

01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:37,680
where we're we're kind of hierarchical

01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,400
and there's federated structure i mean i

01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,559
think the

01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,599
the mobile network operators are

01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,599
offering some

01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:48,640
you know extremely exciting capabilities

01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,040
but um you know the reason that the

01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:54,160
reason that we're investing

01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:58,400
in edge devices is that

01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:01,520
what we would like is for there to be

01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,599
um no cost difference

01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,200
so that people will not buy cheap and

01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,640
insecure

01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:10,559
um and you know

01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,720
then later discover that they didn't

01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:17,200
want to buy insecure

01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:20,640
rather um you know the the idea is that

01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:24,319
there will be secure infrastructure

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,880
and um you know there'll be vendors

01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:28,640
who will be able to sell it at a price

01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,039
competitive

01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,319
with you know you know with junky

01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,960
insecure stuff

01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:36,480
yeah so that's that's cool and i think

01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,680
there are a couple of questions related

01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,880
to that which is

01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,240
how do we expect uh you know global uh

01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,440
players to contribute

01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:48,880
to the effort right in terms of of

01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,440
uh you know of of the projects or more

01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,680
importantly

01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,480
sort of the upstream downstream and i

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,240
think the

01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,920
the one thing i would highlight uh

01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,720
personally having gonna work through

01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,520
this is

01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,319
you know because you know we can view uh

01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,920
this project

01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:06,960
as utilizing you know the upstream

01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:10,559
uh open source projects within lfn

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,599
say you know onap etc lf lf edge like a

01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,440
crano etc

01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,160
or even oran and kubernetes or you know

01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,880
many many

01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,359
you know uh projects that are underneath

01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,400
it

01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:24,960
what we are going to see is you know an

01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,400
end user like adarpa right and a

01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,960
government right would

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,039
would contribute back any research or

01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,640
any findings or anything from then open

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,240
source perspective and upstream it

01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,799
with the help of the community right so

01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,160
the the work actual collaboration and

01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,160
the entity and this is

01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:42,079
open source 101 you know always push

01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,400
stuff to upstream don't fork

01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,839
don't play it out and i think that's how

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,480
we are setting this up

01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:50,400
which is clean and it's always done in

01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,920
the open community open source

01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,760
uh world through a commercial ecosystem

01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,839
that exists as part of linux foundation

01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,760
so i'm i'm just trying to paraphrase the

01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:01,599
question and kind of answer the setup as

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,640
well that we have for linux foundation

01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,200
so

01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,119
any other thoughts jms you want to add

01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:11,119
on that

01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:14,160
well i think i think that

01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,559
that that what you're gonna get

01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,559
is

01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,280
you're gonna get a lot of evolution

01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,400
and this will affect the global

01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,839
community

01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,760
you're gonna get a evolution in the

01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:33,680
applications

01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,039
that people want to use these devices

01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:38,559
for

01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:41,839
um uh

01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:44,400
uh i don't think you know if we if we

01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:47,920
rolled back the clock

01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:51,520
many many years that

01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:54,720
um that the vision

01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:58,480
was say to interconnect supercomputers

01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,920
with the internet but but in reality

01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,240
you know most of the bytes that are

01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,520
moving on the internet today

01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:09,760
are email um

01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:13,039
social networking data

01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:15,839
etc and so

01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,240
um you know i don't think we'll be able

01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,960
to

01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:25,599
fully um envision

01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:29,760
what will happen but you know i i see

01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:32,960
i see um

01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:35,599
i see for example that you you

01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,680
imagine the following so let's say

01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:40,960
you're on a curvy

01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:44,720
road in the alps um

01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:47,920
you could conceivably have cameras

01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:51,760
placed ahead of you on the curve

01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:55,280
and have your automobile reach out

01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,280
um and

01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:00,559
give you a view around the curve

01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,760
which today people might hack up with

01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,599
mirrors

01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:06,720
but you know you could you could do that

01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:10,000
with an iot device in 5g

01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,039
because you have the capacity

01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,400
with the 5g offerings to do that

01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,799
so you know this is just this is to just

01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,400
take one crisp example

01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:23,920
of a safety application that might be

01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,960
considered

01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,799
a useful public infrastructure but it

01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,880
has to be secure because what you don't

01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:32,240
want somebody doing is monkeying with

01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,280
this

01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:39,599
and for example um

01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:43,520
you know showing showing um

01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:46,799
uh nothing there and you have a

01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:50,079
you know a a double semi

01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,880
tractor trailer coming around the curve

01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,440
so

01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,480
you know that that's just an example of

01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:58,240
how

01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:00,640
of how we think um you know security

01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,920
helps everyone it's it's

01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:06,400
it's uh you know there seem to be

01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,079
people who like to monkey around with

01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,920
with systems that are trying to help

01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,400
people and we're trying to stop that

01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,480
i i think that's that's a great

01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,359
statement to sort of uh

01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,680
wrap this up but very very insightful

01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:19,839
and

01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,760

01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:24,799
thank you gms

01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,160

uh okay with that insight

01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:39,359
uh i think we move to another sort of uh

01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:41,440
an enterprise end user um

01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,960

01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,839
know you know walmart

01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,920
i think i don't think you should be on

01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:50,240
the call no sorry

01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,240
but we have uh you know from the office

she is actually the uh you know

01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,359
brains behind figuring out how to

01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:08,079
you know lead with technology how to

01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:10,880
lead with open technology

01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,440
in specific enterprise vertical right in

01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,319
this case

01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,200
you know retail but how that can be

01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:17,120
utilized

01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,199
across a lot more and what they are

01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,839
doing to kind of step up the game here

01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:22,400
so

01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:25,839

as well as the opportunity to

01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,920
make our first i think

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,640
presentation here in this absolutely

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,279
fantastic

01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:54,560
organization and forum as erbit said

01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:57,040
walmart almost everyone knows walmart

01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,400
we are the largest retailer and

01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:03,520
traditionally our businesses have been

01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:07,520
operated in store uh from stores

01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:10,640
and clubs uh and recently on e-commerce

01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,799
or online um and

01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,560
and when when our pet and team asked me

01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:18,560
to do a presentation here

01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:20,880
uh on how what is open source

01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,759
positioning within walmart as well as

01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,759
how

01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,440
uh walmart can contribute back to the

01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,679
community in lends

01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,719
of with the view and in the lens with uh

01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,960
what is happening

01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,239
in the last one year due to pandemic and

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,560
everything else i thought this was a

01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:36,880
fantastic opportunity to kind of

01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,359
illustrate some of the challenges

01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,159
walmart had had to face in the last one

01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,640
year

01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:44,640
and and how we were able to absolutely

01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,759
use the open source technology

01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,000
um available in the community to scale

01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,120
our

01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,159
business as well as some of the not so

01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:55,760
well-known contributions but back to the

01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:57,679
community in the recent past

01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,679
and what we plan to do in the next

01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,520
couple of years to come

01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,360
in contributing back to the community

01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,440
and to forming an

01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,400
extremely symbiotic fruitful

01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,600
relationship next time please

01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,719
so so this is just a quick illustration

01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:17,280
of the business impact we all have had a

01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,679
tremendous impact i absolutely resonated

01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:23,840
when priyanka was talking about

01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:26,320
um the changes that the pandemic

01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,520
brought about in not just in our daily

01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:30,320
lives but also

01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,239
how businesses work just to give you an

01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:37,040
illustration of scale

01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:40,880
and we we service 222

01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:44,400
million customers across omni channel

01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,560
across 24 countries um

01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,920
we it's a it's a it's it's an

01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,679
interesting tidbit that

01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,280
when everybody else was running out of

01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,040
toilet papers you were able to actually

01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,360
provide those toilet papers that was

01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,800
quite

01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,960
quite interesting and i thought that i

01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,199
should just put it in here

01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,000
um traditionally most of walmart

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,159
customers

01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,840
should have the percentage of walmart

01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:06,080
transactions were primarily

01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,520
in store and in clubs and not

01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,880
necessarily

01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:13,920
as much in terms of percentage online

01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,120
what covid has done is completely flip

01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,159
it for us

01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:21,280
we've seen up to 76 percent increase in

01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:23,360
increase in e-commerce traffic

01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,640
we also observed that there was a

01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,239
significant change

01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:30,080
in customer patterns behavior patterns

01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:31,840
more and more walmart more and more

01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,800
customers were coming to walmart

01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,159
first second because of price edlc

01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,000
strategy

01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:40,880
second we observed was more and more

01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,920
customers were buying online but picking

01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,040
up in store

01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:47,120
so technologies like bopus and check-in

01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,560
not only had to be developed fast but

01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:51,760
also we had to scale

01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,239
really fast we also understood

01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,560
that hyper personalization although it

01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,600
had all was already happening but it

01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,719
accelerated

01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:03,199
during the covet times

01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,960
given the change in customer patterns

01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,840
what we observed was

01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,920
stores now instead of being the product

01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,080
discovery and transaction centers

01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,719
were becoming in or morphing into

01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:18,159
fulfillment centers

01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:21,360
and so advent of new technology

01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:22,000
how ensuring that latency requirements

01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,640
to support

01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,360
our associates who are fulfilling these

01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,600
orders

01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,199
how does supply chain work what kind of

01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,679
technology needs to be

01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,440
hosted where all of those became more

01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,760
and more important problems for us to

01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,320
solve during the last year

01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,840
and most importantly rising volumes was

01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,840
fantastic for our business

01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,199
was given retail business in our

01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,199
operating margins

01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:47,920
operational efficiencies became

01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:51,199
paramount for us

01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,600
so how did this impact technology

01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:56,080
we had to absolutely modernize our tech

01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:59,520
stack we were already on that process

01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,679
last year or 2018 19

01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,960
was a big year for us to modernize our

01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:05,520
tech stack

01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,560
we are increasingly moving our workloads

01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,880
to cloud

01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:11,199
we have now on analytics workload

01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,560
completely on cloud we have 1.7

01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:16,159
petabytes of data

01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:19,120
residing there but it also meant

01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,760
that we also had a significantly large

01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,560
on-prem

01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,679
presence so we operate in a hybrid cloud

01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,480
environment

01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,280
we have presence on azure google as well

01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,360
as

01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:33,760
on on-prem in our own data centers

01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,360
not only that we also had to figure out

01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,719
how to scale

01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:41,199
our fleet up and down seamlessly

01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,040
in a way that actually had minimal

01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:46,800
impact in availability

01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:48,719
reliability as well as security

01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,239
as part of this whole process of

01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,840
modernizing stick stack

01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,280
modernizing making sure that our fleet

01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,239
was available and

01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,080
or or available for uh sourcing traffic

01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:01,199
etc

01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,600
the very first tenant as we all know for

01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:05,199
for for uh for a highly available system

01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,480
is observability

01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:10,880
and we the observability became even

01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,520
bigger principle in how we design our

01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,320
systems

01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,080
how do we restructure re-architect or

01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,440
fleet how do we make them cloud native

01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:20,320
so on so forth

01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:23,199
observability observability at every

01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:25,679
layer of our stack

01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:27,760
and as i said stores were morphing

01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,159
stores were smurfing into fulfillment

01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,800
centers from a business perspective

01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:35,280
but then we started to look at and in

01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,760
the past we as an example we had three

01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,880
nodes

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,560
uh in store to uh deploy business

01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,560
continuity applications for very

01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,320
critical applications like cloud power

01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,560
checkout so check out as an example in

01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,120
store was absolutely critical for us

01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,800
however as more and more technology was

01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,920
being used by us

01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:57,360
for uh the changing customer patterns

01:14:53,920 --> 01:15:00,080
cloud our our edge presence

01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,480
in store and how we then think about

01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:06,080
edge platform for walmart start to

01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:09,040
change as well and to again

01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,480
um and and and through the process most

01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,080
importantly and

01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,840
just to take a step back the last three

01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,600
to four years i think walmart is very

01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,520
proud to know i mean

01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,880
it's it's it's very little known fact

01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,199
but we are one of the

01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,280
extremely early adopters of ai and ml to

01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:26,400
drive operational efficiencies

01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:28,560
within retail sector and we have had

01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,760
tremendous amount of returns in terms of

01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,719
efficiencies due to

01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,960
um due to these measures and we will

01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,960
continue to invest in ai and ml in the

01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,199
next foreseeable future and then

01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,120
kobet has definitely accelerated that

01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:43,920
and that investment

01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,920
next slide please

01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:50,560
so so we just talked about business

01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,800
impact of code

01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,880
how did that impact our technology stack

01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:58,239
what did we have to do

01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,239
um and again i always um i i

01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:03,360
joined walmart a couple of months ago

01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:06,560
and and it always amazes me that

01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,120
it's it's almost impossible for to run

01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,360
such an

01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,239
extremely large efficient operation

01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,280
without

01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:15,520
latest and greatest technology and

01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,560
we don't talk very much about it outside

01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,280
walmart

01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,159
and we are huge consumers of open source

01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,640
technology

01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,239
we have node.js to openstack on the

01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,360
left-hand side what you're seeing

01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:29,520
is just a few open source technologies

01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,960
that we actually currently use

01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:35,360
and has helped us to do exactly what we

01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:38,320
talked in the previous slide which is

01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,679
ensuring our tech stack is able to scale

01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:43,520
scale seamlessly

01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:47,280
and be able to then um work for

01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,000
the future use cases on the right side

01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,840
which again

01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,760
walmart is not very known for and

01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,080
hopefully with this collaboration with

01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,440
linux foundation we will be a bit

01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:59,760
more um out there um

01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,760
we have actively open source these are

01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,880
the top three projects in the last year

01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,640
and a half

01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,960
electrode is our node.js framework and

01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,760
oneops is essentially our cloud

01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,880
deployment

01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:16,800
and workload management

01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:20,400
platform primarily earlier designed for

01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,400
vms but again you all as i mentioned

01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,840
earlier we operate in a multi-cloud

01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,159
environment

01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,120
our store nodes which is we also are

01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:30,560
also managed

01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,440
through one-offs and and in the next

01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,600
iteration of onenote is actually our

01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,000
kubernetes-based

01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,679
uh with what is called as wcnp um but

01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,280
essentially it's again another

01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,719
cloud management workload management

01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,960
software deployment software

01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,080
um that manages regardless of whether

01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,120
your workload sits whether

01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:50,159
it's on-prem off-prem etc

01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:52,320
and then concord is our ci cd platform

01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,360
so so again i think what i want to kind

01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,840
of illustrate here

01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,880
is um just from a business consumer

01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,440
perspective

01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,239
although walmart may be no more known as

01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,920
a retail

01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:07,040
giant what has powered walmart's

01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:10,880
business and operations has been

01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:12,400
a technology b investments in

01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,520
infrastructure and

01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:18,239
and and um innovations that has

01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:19,199
helped scale and scale up our technology

01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:22,239
stack

01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:26,080
and three absolute

01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:29,360
um um i wouldn't say

01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,880
collaboration as much as usage right now

01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,520
but in the future collaboration with the

01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,360
openstack

01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,480
open source community to actually help

01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:40,560
us uh attain that scale

01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:44,000
next slide please

01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,880
um so so bringing it down to the topic

01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,080
of today right

01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:50,320
edge cloud networking area and

01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,400
so some of the open source technology

01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,480
that we've used

01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,840
to solve the similar problems that we

01:18:54,480 --> 01:19:00,320
talked about is

01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:03,040
envoy and istio um easteo was

01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,440
opt in last year but now we're moving to

01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,640
opt

01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:09,360
out so so across all applications

01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,360
so it is becoming even more important

01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,320
for us to be able to

01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,120
um understand what services we operate

01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,000
understand

01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:19,120
uh have a fantastic topology of of

01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,960
everything that we run

01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,679
regardless of where we run and be able

01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,640
to then effectively manage

01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,440
and get get the observability we need

01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,719
ebpf

01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:34,000
is another uh significant player in

01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:36,159
in what we have um been able to do on

01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,600
the network and networking side

01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:42,960
uh in fact um i i we are

01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:46,239
in in in the early early phase of

01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:49,520
figuring out how to give back

01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:52,640
what we have done with eb ebpf to the

01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,920
developer community one example of what

01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:57,600
we were able to achieve

01:19:53,920 --> 01:20:00,400
through our ebpf solution is that um

01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,760
we were able to control uh the

01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,400
connection limit

01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,040
as as a feature set the number of

01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,040
current

01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,320
concurrent connections on tv and proxy

01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,440
node um

01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,679
so we had um

01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,600
during the christmas time the shopping

01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:18,719
season we had an event

01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,520
um we were able to control the number of

01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,440
networks

01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,040
um that were or the number of

01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:26,000
connections that were coming in

01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,800
we were able to very effectively manage

01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,880
them and have

01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:32,400
um um have a way of

01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,159
still maintaining our customer

01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:37,280
experience without necessarily

01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:38,800
taking down the entire site um so

01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,719
we will be talking a little bit more

01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,719
hopefully in the next few weeks about

01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:44,080
what that ebpf solution is and how we

01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,080
are planning to open source it through

01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:48,719
linux foundation and

01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,600
and of course uh we are active members

01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,639
of cncf

01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,400
and we've had other um open source

01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,280
technology that we've used in the past

01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,280
and we hope

01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,639
to continue to use it in the future as

01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:03,360
well um

01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:03,360
again um next slide please

01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:08,480
um so again my my my talk is fairly

01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:10,080
short i was given 15 minutes um so i

01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:13,440
thought 10 minutes for speaking but

01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,600
very quickly um so that asked me so what

01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:17,040
would be walmart's call out to the open

01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,080
source community

01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:22,560
um again this is a stance we are taking

01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,120
um in the last three to four years we

01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,040
have

01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,560
we have done a tremendous amount of

01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,880
investments in

01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,440
not just using open source technology

01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:35,679
but also giving back to the community

01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:38,800
uh we hope and uh that we are able to

01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,760
form collaborative partnerships across

01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,239
this community

01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,120
uh you know through linux foundation's

01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:46,800
help

01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:50,639
um there are many uh again uh the wcnp

01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,360
or o1 ops uh workload management and

01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:54,800
workforce

01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:57,280
deployment software uh we plan to

01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,199
uh open source it as well we planned to

01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,600
make sure that others can benefit

01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,639
through

01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:04,320
a multi-cloud deployment tool that we

01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,960
have greatly benefited from

01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,800
it has increased developer productivity

01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,040
deployment doesn't happen

01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,800
as painfully as it used to especially

01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,920
you know we are very few one of the very

01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,719
few companies

01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,880
uh that have also extremely important

01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:21,920
workloads running in edge in our stores

01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:25,679
so we hope that uh the community

01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:27,600
um is uh

01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:29,280
we were able to we were able to make a

01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:32,000
call out to the community to

01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,719
effectively partnership with us um early

01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,199
adoption

01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,080
and again this is another call out um

01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:38,639
you know

01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,520
we are with walmart's scale and

01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,639
complexity

01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:44,800
um uh very few other companies uh

01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:46,400
will want to solve and then provide it

01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,360
back to the community so

01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,480
um adopting some of our software early

01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,719
on will prior

01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:54,159
will hopefully give you uh the benefits

01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,400
that we have reaped and

01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:57,760
and we can form a symbiotic relationship

01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,040
and then from a prioritization

01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,800
perspective i hope that

01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:04,880
we are able to um prioritize this uh

01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,880
some of our technologies for all of us

01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,520
uh collectively

01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,639
to read the benefits so all in all i

01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,679
think they're three different

01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,159
big call outs one is um that we want to

01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:16,320
be

01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:17,600
um we are making a statement here that

01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,639
we want to

01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,080
become even more active partners in and

01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,199
collaborators in the open source

01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:26,080
community

01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,480
uh the second is uh there are many open

01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,400
source

01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,560
um technologies that we've used in the

01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,920
past um you know whether it's onwire

01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,760
istio for

01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:39,920
uh for service mesh and um

01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:42,080
other other use cases or evpf based

01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,840
technologies for network functions

01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:46,400
deployment of network functions and

01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,880
example observability within our stack

01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:50,000
or

01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,159
um and and as part of that uh

01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,040
whole ecosystem we hope that we can

01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,520
become

01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,560
bigger partners and uh play a bigger

01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,639
role in the

01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,159
in the community going forward um so

01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:03,199
thank you

01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:05,920
all right excellent uh so

01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:07,360
i i i i know we're a couple of minutes

01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,719
late but i do want to

01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,000
uh take one question which is really a

01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,280
summary of five

01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,480
similar questions that have come in most

01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:20,800
of all of the questions are related to

01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:22,960
the decade-old question you know is

01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,400
centralization good or is distributed

01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,679
good right and specifically in the

01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,080
context of edge

01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,159
so the question really surrounds the

01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,719
walmart strategy where

01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:33,360
you know uh whether it's because of

01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,400
coved

01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:37,199
or just online or whatever right uh what

01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,360
do you have to do

01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:40,800
to you know which workloads really are

01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:43,040
relevant in the edge

01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,840
data centers slash stores slash

01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:48,719
distributed sort of

01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:50,560
retail outlets versus centralization

01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:55,520
right

01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:57,120
yeah so um it's so as we are

01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,719
that's an excellent question by the way

01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,639
in fact that's exactly what

01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,120
i and my team are right now thinking to

01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:05,199
figure out what is our edge strategy

01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,400
what kind of workload should be our edge

01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,320
what should be our edge

01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,080
platform as a service as an example

01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,679
whether it's internal or external what

01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,920
should we do with there

01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,199
the ones that came to light very quickly

01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,520
and i'll first talk about

01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:19,440
overall edge use cases and i can then

01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,880
talk a little specific about walmart's

01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,239
edge use cases

01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:26,239
the one the workloads that are overall

01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:28,159
feel like that can be deployed on the

01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:30,400
edge are

01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:31,199
primarily the one that require and again

01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,800
it's a it's a very

01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:38,080
um it require low latency and high comp

01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:41,360
fast compute right extremely data driven

01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:44,480
um we have seen workloads like

01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,120
ai and audio arvr workloads that we need

01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,000
to have

01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:49,360
a fairly significant and robust edge

01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,480
edge platform

01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:56,320
uh we are investing heavily in uh

01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:59,360
security that is driven by um

01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:01,280
by cameras so processing image is

01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:03,280
extremely fast and being able to

01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,960
inference so ai and ml driven

01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,120
inferencing so anything that you have to

01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,679
very quickly uh inference

01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,679
and which will affect your latency is

01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,679
going to be a challenge for us so those

01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,480
workloads will be on edge we already

01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:18,239
have

01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:19,440
a gpu uh nodes on in every store to be

01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,760
able to process

01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:24,159
uh those use cases security related use

01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,159
cases

01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:29,280
checkout and payment systems payment

01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:33,760
gateways so we are introducing

01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:35,360
um self-checkouts we are introducing

01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,679
seamless shopping experience within

01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,800
stores as well this is again one of our

01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,960
covet learnings

01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,800
so a combination of security and

01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,520
checkout will be very critical where

01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,800
latency is critical for us we cannot to

01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,920
reduce fraud and

01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,639
other things we are also experimenting

01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:54,320
with uh

01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:56,080
drones um and uh anything that is

01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,440
related to a chatty application if the

01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,679
drone architecture is not

01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,360
right but most importantly we don't see

01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,600
that chattiness but what we see

01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:05,280
is that there is a significant amount of

01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,280
data offloading that is required for

01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:09,440
anything autonomous devices whether it's

01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:12,800
drones whether it's vehicles within

01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:16,080
uh walmart's um uh fleet or

01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,639
uh even robotics within um that that

01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,600
that

01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,639
that happens that are used within

01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,719
walmart's uh

01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:24,000
infrastructure and space we have seen

01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,520
those use cases where there's a

01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,040
significant amount of data offloading

01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,600
and computation that is required so

01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,840
those are the

01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,639
some use cases that we feel that edge

01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,639
will become

01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,400
extremely critical oh my god yeah this

01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:36,159
is very much in line with i think what

01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,080
the community is thinking so very good

01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:40,320
thank you very much for

01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,600
for giving your insights here at the at

01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:45,360
the summit so thanks

01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:48,000
thanks a lot thank you all right

01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,880
and then um you know uh you know i would

01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,320
say

01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,920
the the uh the next presentation

01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:58,080
requires no introduction right

01:27:53,920 --> 01:28:01,760
um andre fooch and atnt you know are

01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:03,679
the poster child of open source uh

01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,880
thought leadership they have been

01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:07,600
leading

01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,480
the global ecosystem on how to think

01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,520
open

01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:14,880
how to change you know capex opex

01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,600
you know radicalizing sdn nfv

01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,159
automation you know and and kind of

01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,880
showing

01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:23,040
the rest of us the way so and and you

01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,600
know if i introduce andre then i think

01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,760
i'll get

01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,880
some negative points because you know

01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,560
that's like

01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,400
not a good thing and everybody knows

01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,719
andre so take it on

01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,719
peace

01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:40,800
[Music]

01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:43,280
thank you um it's great to be here and

01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,239
uh thanks everyone for tuning in uh this

01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,760
is

01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:49,760
uh hopefully a a much brighter uplifting

01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:53,440
year we're heading into

01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:56,080
uh compared to last year and um

01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:58,159
and certainly you know with the pandemic

01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,440
on everything we experienced last year

01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:05,199
uh it undoubtedly changed the world

01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:07,679
um and i will say the one thing that

01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:10,080
hasn't changed here at a t

01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:12,080
is really our commitment to keeping our

01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:14,719
customers connected

01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:17,280
and you know the work we do at att is

01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:20,400
really critical to millions of people

01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:23,040
businesses and first responders

01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,960
not just throughout the united states

01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,280
but throughout the world

01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,560
and i'm really proud to say that our

01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:31,600
network

01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,719
uh has really withstood this test in

01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,920
time

01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:38,639
and i can't say enough about

01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:40,320
not just the amazing technology that

01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:43,600
delivered that but also the amazing

01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:48,080
people that were behind that technology

01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,080
and um while we didn't see covet coming

01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,080
we've done a tremendous amount of

01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,840
building and

01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:56,080
investing in our network over the past

01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,239
several years that have really

01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,159
paid dividends during this crisis and

01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:03,199
i'm going to share a bit about that

01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:04,800
uh shortly if you look at the investment

01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:08,560
we've made

01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:10,719
we put in well over 135 billion dollars

01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,960
over the past five years

01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:14,239
uh into our united states uh

01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,040
infrastructure

01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:17,920
to build a very robust network with

01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:21,360
self-healing

01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,880
architectures open standards that have

01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:26,320
really helped us

01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,600
get ready for this you know arguably

01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:30,080
unforeseen moment

01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,520
in history that we all have been

01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:34,960
experiencing

01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:36,800
so if we go to the next slide

01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,960
let me kind of show you some data behind

01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:42,159
what i'm talking about here

01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:44,960
um you know when it comes to our network

01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:46,560
even without covid we were carrying more

01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:50,080
data

01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,639
than ever before in fact our global

01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:54,480
network

01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:57,199
carries more than 450 petabytes

01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,679
of data traffic on an average day that's

01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:01,199
that's

01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:02,719
quite a bit of traffic um you can see on

01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:05,920
this chart here on the left

01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:09,520
um and it coincidentally it was exactly

01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:13,520
one year ago to this day march 10th

01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:17,120
2020 when we began to see really

01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:19,840
the first major traffic surge

01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:21,280
that you could argue was due to the

01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:24,560
covid stay-at-home

01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:26,239
mandates that were being issued across

01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,600
the country

01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:33,199
not to mention across the world

01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:36,480
and you can quickly see

01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:39,120
the surge the jump we saw across

01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,239
our backbone network as depicted in this

01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,880
graph

01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:44,800
we saw over a 20 percent increase in

01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,520
traffic in just

01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:50,159
three weeks compared to pre-pandemic

01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:53,520
figures it's pretty astounding

01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:57,199
and as you can look you can see the

01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:59,199
growth really has not slowed

01:31:57,199 --> 01:32:01,360
if you pay attention to sort of the

01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:04,560
right hand side of that graph

01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:06,080
you can also see a late surge towards

01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,760
the end of the year

01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:10,000
and i get a lot of questions like what

01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:13,120
happened there well

01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,280
it may be a distant memory or maybe not

01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:19,040
too long ago we had a lot going on

01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:21,440
in the last few months of the year

01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:24,480
um of course we had the elections going

01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:27,840
on so we saw a lot of traffic

01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:29,600
going across the network in terms of uh

01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,679
what you're seeing with the social media

01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,360
networks a lot of uploading of videos

01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:36,400
and downloading the videos

01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:40,159
we also saw this tremendous surge in 4k

01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:43,840
traffic that's 4k video streaming

01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:45,120
and this really corresponds to a lot of

01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:50,080
the strong

01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:53,280
4k tv sales that were reported

01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:56,639
in the last quarter as you probably know

01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:57,760
with everyone being home a lot of folks

01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,159
out there

01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,679
i guess decided to upgrade their their

01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:02,960
display sets and of course if you're

01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,080
going to upgrade you want to go with the

01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,840
latest

01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:09,199
and so 4k has certainly showed up in the

01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:12,239
statistics

01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:15,440
we also saw a great increase in

01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:16,800
icloud traffic too we all know apple

01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:20,080
launched their

01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:22,560
latest and greatest iphone and that was

01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,400
been a very popular product

01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,320
and of course as people have been

01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,719
syncing up their pictures and videos we

01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,360
saw

01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:31,040
a lot of up streaming traffic hit the

01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:33,760
network as well

01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:35,199
so that's that sort of accounts for that

01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,639
some of the components and that big

01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,880
surge you see towards the end of the

01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:40,480
year

01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,320
i want to just share a couple other

01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,400
interesting data points that we saw

01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:47,600
throughout the year

01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:50,719
you know early on in the pandemic

01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:52,639
customers twice set the record for text

01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:56,400
messaging

01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:59,360
during the march spring break last year

01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:00,239
and on easter weekend people were

01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:03,520
sending

01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:06,000
at one point more than 23 000

01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,360
text messages per second across the 18t

01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,840
network

01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,600
um you know if you look at the previous

01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:15,520
peak pre-pandemic

01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:17,920
that was about 15 000 uh text per second

01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:22,159
so that's about a 53 53

01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:25,679
increase compared to pre-pandemic levels

01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:27,520
also um believe it or not voice is

01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:30,840
popular

01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:34,719
voice became popular again um

01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:38,320
wireless voice usage sword

01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:40,960
uh we saw over a 40 increase

01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,400
as people began to work from home and

01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,800
use their mobile design

01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:46,000
devices to attend meetings and

01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,800
conference calls

01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,560
and uh you know to uh connect in and

01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,920
stay productive

01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:56,480
um of course um also

01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,080
interesting um that was voice that

01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,960
surged but what's interesting on mobile

01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:02,080
data

01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:04,639
and maybe this is surprising to some but

01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,960
mobile data volumes actually slightly

01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:10,400
decreased

01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:13,440
during the early part of covid

01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:14,560
last year since many people were

01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:17,360
connecting

01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,840
their mobile smartphones to their wi-fi

01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:22,320
broadband connected networks at home

01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:24,159
and so that sort of accounts for why we

01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,360
would see on the cellular network kind

01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:28,639
of a

01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:31,760
decrease on the on the data side there

01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:33,679
now i also want to talk a bit about our

01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:37,040
first responders and this is a really

01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:38,880
important part of att's network

01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:41,119
we built a whole separate network

01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:44,080
dedicated to first responders

01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:45,600
we call it firstnet and thanks to the

01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,280
unique benefits like

01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,440
dedicated connectivity when it's

01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,040
necessary always on priority and

01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:54,320
preemption

01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:57,040
and also a very high quality

01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:58,719
dedicated spectrum of what we call band

01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:00,960
14.

01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,159
uh firstnet is one of the fastest

01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:06,159
commercial networks

01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:10,239
out there and we have over two million

01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:13,119
uh connections on this firstnet network

01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:15,040
and we're also seeing some interesting

01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:16,880
behaviors and statistics there where

01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,679
first responders consume

01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:21,920
more than twice as much data as our

01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,360
general consumers reinforcing the need

01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,840
and importance

01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:28,800
of having a network purpose built for

01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,800
public safety

01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:32,520
our atc network was able to withstand

01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,199
this

01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:37,600
unprecedented new normal of demand as

01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:40,960
you can see in that chart

01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:43,440
and and that was really

01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,679
thanks to the investments that were made

01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,960
uh and a lot of behind the scenes work

01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:50,080
that we've

01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:52,320
frankly put into these open initiatives

01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,840
over the past decade and so i'm going to

01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,560
talk a little bit more here on the next

01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,440
slide of

01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,440
what we've done there

01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:05,760
so a lot of this was started

01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:08,320
with a program about

01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,440
seven years ago now that was really we

01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:12,800
set out

01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:16,159
uh to virtualize and

01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:17,360
and software enable uh the majority of

01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:20,400
our network

01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:21,679
and this is really the foundation of

01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,520
everything we do

01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,880
and part of this really important

01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:28,080
foundation

01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,440
is open source technology and the

01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,320
advances we've made in

01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,440
in cloud native virtualization

01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:35,679
containerization

01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,360
hardware and software disaggregation

01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:40,400
really allowed us

01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:42,320
to reach our software-based networking

01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,920
goals of 75

01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:48,800
this was a goal that we pledged

01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,760
many years ago to hit by the end of uh

01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,560
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:55,119
and i'm proud to say that we not only

01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:58,880
hit that goal but we surpassed it

01:37:55,119 --> 01:38:02,320
and right now we're well over 77

01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:04,000
um so a lot of great work and kudos to

01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,400
the folks the many many great people

01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:10,480
that were behind making that happen

01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:12,239
and especially the many many open source

01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,520
software projects out there that we've

01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,760
been a part of

01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:17,280
in those communities that have helped us

01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,040
get there

01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,880
so having a much more software-centric

01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:22,400
network really enables us to respond

01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,840
rapidly

01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:28,840
to any new demand on the network

01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,880
you know even those that are caused by

01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,560
pandemics uh just a couple quick

01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:35,920
examples here

01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:38,880
uh i mentioned voice becoming popular

01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,639
uh voice over wi-fi was a hundred

01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:45,040
percent virtualized prior to

01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:47,520
uh covet 19. and uh that's really thanks

01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:50,239
to the great work that we did

01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:53,920
uh to roll out and deploy our

01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:56,960
virtualized evolved data packet gateways

01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,320
that's a network component that we use

01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,960
internally and these functions

01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,880
run basically on openstack on our on our

01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:05,199
internal network cloud

01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,119
and we use onap for orchestration and

01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:09,280
data analytics

01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:12,080
uh and in addition we also have our

01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:14,719
engineering and operations team using

01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,520
uh quite a large suite of open source

01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:18,560
tools

01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:21,280
to help monitor and manage uh what's

01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:22,800
running in production

01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,480
you know during the first few months in

01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,800
the pandemic wi-fi calling

01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:29,199
averaged 90 percent higher than

01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:31,199
pre-coded levels

01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,400
and not surprisingly the average call

01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:35,920
duration was over

01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:39,040
75 percent longer than pre-coded

01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:42,239
um and that network worked flawlessly

01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:44,400
and and again that was because of this

01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:47,520
great foundation that was really based

01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:50,800
on a lot of good work and open

01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:53,040
open standards and open source

01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,400
um another great example is uh what

01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,199
we've done in our

01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:59,360
what we call our sd-wan service space

01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,840
this is a global service that we offer

01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,719
to our

01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,360
enterprise customers basically this is

01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:06,480
um

01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:08,560
i think of it as enterprise vpns for

01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:10,800
employees to access their

01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,159
private corporate networks from anywhere

01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,840
they might be

01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:18,960
on any type of ordinary broadband access

01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,280
and as most of us saw early on in covid

01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,080
and

01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,719
even still today home access to these

01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,880
private

01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:26,800
corporate networks is absolutely

01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:29,199
essential

01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:31,760
there was a dramatic increase in usage

01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:35,440
of these services during the covet

01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,880
19 spread across the world in fact we

01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:40,239
saw a 16

01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:42,800
uh times demand surge

01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:44,960
uh compared to the average usage in

01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,639
2019.

01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,639
the virtualization of the service

01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:50,080
allowed us to dynamically increase our

01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:53,840
capacity to meet

01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:56,800
the surging demand uh in weeks

01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:59,679
so again a great testament to a lot of

01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:02,400
the software behind this great service

01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:04,159
um also mobile messaging as i mentioned

01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:06,480
earlier

01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:09,199
you know here at att we experienced a

01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:12,800
three years of text messaging growth

01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:16,080
in just one week um and that was

01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:19,280
uh uh again uh

01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:22,639
something we've never seen prior

01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:24,480
and we fortunately had moved

01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:26,960
this messaging traffic from our legacy

01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,560
infrastructure to our cloud-based

01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,840
infrastructure again our internal

01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:33,280
network cloud-based infrastructure to

01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:35,920
assist uh

01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:36,320
to offload and really help this demand

01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,679
uh

01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:41,520
to help serve this demand surge and

01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:43,040
our software enabled network allowed us

01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:45,600
to add more than 60

01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:48,000
capacity to our messaging platform in

01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,760
just one day

01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,320
so you know as you can see from these

01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:55,520
examples this is really the power

01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,080
of having an open automated software

01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,320
centric

01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:02,560
network and it enables a much more agile

01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,920
dynamic network that can elastically

01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:05,840
scale

01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,360
to me you know whatever the demands and

01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,159
needs are

01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:12,960
that we throw at it so if we're going to

01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:15,840
the next slide here

01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,880
and this is my last slide just quickly

01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:21,119
here i want to just

01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:24,159
share um just a few of the projects

01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:26,960
of the many open source projects that

01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:28,560
we've been participating uh in the

01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,520
community with

01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:33,840
and just highlight a couple of areas

01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,480
that have really helped us

01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,000
position our network and to deliver some

01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,960
of the examples i just walked you

01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,960
through

01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:46,560
um first the open compute project

01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:49,679
um you know we previously submitted

01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:51,119
designs for several open disaggregated

01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:55,679
routing platforms

01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:58,880
to ocp and since then we've been

01:42:55,679 --> 01:43:02,159
deploying our next gen ip

01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:04,080
mpls core routing platform into our

01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,880
production network based on this open

01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:08,159
hardware

01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:11,360
design reference spec

01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:12,080
we also chose some uh brought in some

01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,000
very

01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,360
uh new and innovative disruptive

01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,800
suppliers

01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:20,880
uh such as drive nets and they're

01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,719
providing the network operating system

01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,360
software for this uh

01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:28,159
core use case and it's in production

01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:32,080
today and it's working quite well

01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:36,719
we also followed up uh with our first

01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:39,280
att ip edge use case appearing use case

01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,960
which is also running uh in our

01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,040
production network today it's actually

01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:46,080
running on the exact same hardware

01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:49,199
as our core however we chose

01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:52,000
a different software layer

01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:52,880
a different nos and in this case here we

01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,760
chose cisco

01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,320
and their ios xr network operating

01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,000
system

01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,440
to provide the management control

01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,440
functions

01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:04,800
for att's iph network

01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:07,920
and this is really the start of a

01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:11,199
journey to converge the spirit

01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,600
edge implementations we have today

01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:15,360
uh onto a more common software and

01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,679
hardware driving

01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:20,080
uh platform that really delivers

01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:24,400
uniformity simplification

01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:27,440
and agility and this is what's

01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:30,719
really going to power our network

01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:33,840
for the next decade as we see you know

01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,800
continued growth i call it you know the

01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,880
tsunami

01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,560
of demand that hits our network each and

01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:41,760
every day

01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:44,000
um another uh a

01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,360
really important project here um that

01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,639
we've got launched here is

01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:51,920
airship um and you know att's

01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:55,840
5g cloud infrastructure uh is

01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:58,159
really enabled by airship

01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,480
and the cloud native computing

01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:04,080
foundation cncf

01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:05,119
and uh recently att we contributed

01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,719
airship

01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:08,000
uh which is a purpose-built

01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:09,520
high-performance network cloud

01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,960
infrastructure

01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:16,080
that integrates about 14 different cnn

01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:19,119
cncf projects together

01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:22,800
and att's network cloud uses

01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:27,199
airship in in production today to really

01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:31,360
enable faster deployments

01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:34,719
much greater scale and ensures a 100

01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,719
percent consistency

01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:42,800
that the network is is uh operating

01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:45,679
uh as we uh expect it and

01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:46,800
and certainly ensures that it's also

01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:49,840
secured

01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,159
as we need it and i'm proud to say as to

01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,159
now

01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:53,520
airship is a certified kubernetes

01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:56,880
distribution under the

01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:59,760
cncf conformance program this

01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,239
provides us lots of great key benefits

01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,840
uh

01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:06,480
to name a few uh really consistency to

01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:08,800
simplify interactions for users

01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:10,800
it gives us timely updates so we always

01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,719
have the latest features the community

01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,920
has been working on

01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:18,880
uh and then conformability so that any

01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:20,400
user can confirm that their distribution

01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,080
or platform

01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:24,000
remains conformant by running the

01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,440
identical open source conformance

01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,920
applications

01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:28,719
that was used to certify it in the first

01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:31,600
place

01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:32,560
so we're really really happy with how

01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:36,400
that's working

01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:39,600
and a really great project

01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:43,040
another project a new project it's not

01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:45,280
really a new project it's really a

01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:46,719
a convergence of two other projects two

01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:50,239
projects together

01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:53,600
uh just renamed a new kit

01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:54,560
i'm very excited about uh the merging of

01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:57,600
cntt

01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:58,239
and oak pnfe they've come together into

01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,440
the single

01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:02,719
entity here and uh the merger here

01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:05,040
really

01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:06,159
uh builds on a rich development history

01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:09,760
that we've had with

01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:11,679
uh opnfe and the substantial

01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:15,360
specification management

01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:18,719
from cntt and this move will empower the

01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:20,800
global communications community we hope

01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:22,320
to really better bring together the

01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,239
various referent cloud

01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:27,199
excuse me reference cloud infrastructure

01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:30,239
models and architectures

01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:32,239
together and to

01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:34,719
allow us to go much faster and how we

01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:37,199
deploy to be much more reliable

01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:39,280
and of course to be much more secure so

01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:42,400
really a great collaborate

01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:44,320
collaboration here and we're really

01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:47,600
excited to be part of this

01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:51,119
and looking forward to lots of new

01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:53,600
advances to come here

01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:55,520
of course i can't talk about open source

01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,840
without talking about

01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:58,719
the rand the radio access network and of

01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:02,639
course the rand

01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:06,400
we're all about oran yoran alliance

01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,800
and specifically the oran alliance and

01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:10,000
the

01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:12,719
oran software community are really two

01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:15,280
important and very complementary

01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:16,080
open initiatives and the goal of oran is

01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:18,159
to

01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:20,080
really enable new participants to come

01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:22,719
in into

01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,639
the rand space by disaggregating the

01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:27,199
rand with open

01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:28,480
interfaces and the oran software

01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:31,679
community

01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,679
continues to grow it

01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,760
as we've just completed our cherry

01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:38,400
release um

01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,600
just late last year and we're going to

01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:43,040
be moving

01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:45,360
um the oran ecosystem

01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:47,679
closer to commercial deployments around

01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:49,520
the globe

01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:51,520
the number of individual contributors

01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,600
and software commits

01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,800
really grown significantly over the past

01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,920
year and we're really

01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:00,080
proud about that the lat and

01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:02,719
i should say the latest release also

01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:06,320
creates a new software project

01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:08,639
service management and orchestration smo

01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:10,480
and continues to build an open interface

01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,960
to drive development of

01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,520
auto configuration and management of

01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,119
oran

01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:19,280
elements now to show how far

01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:20,880
orange has progressed towards practical

01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:24,080
implementation

01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,920
att along with nokia we just recently

01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:29,920
completed a proof of concept

01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:32,080
demonstrating a full end-to-end

01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:34,320
player three call over a fully

01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:36,960
virtualized cloud ran

01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:39,199
and this successful trial represents a

01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:42,239
really key milestone for us in

01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:46,159
improving out the maturity

01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:47,920
and the capability um of a truly open

01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:49,440
architecture so we're really excited

01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,760
about this

01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,199
and then last but not least i um i have

01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:56,400
to

01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:58,400
talk a bit about onap and

01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:00,080
specifically a lot going on there but

01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,440
specifically i want to just mention the

01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:04,800
alignment

01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:07,520
of onap with oran

01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:09,360
onap does many different things but one

01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:12,320
particular area

01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:13,840
is how onapp is helping us with our 5g

01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:17,840
and oran initiatives

01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:20,639
and onap is positioned to serve as a

01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,000
an open source implementation really

01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:23,840
supporting the

01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,360
as i mentioned the oran service

01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,639
management and orchestration

01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:29,599
functionality

01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:31,199
and also this uh non-real-time brand

01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:33,760
intelligent controller

01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:34,400
that we've been working on and as we all

01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,199
know

01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:38,239
data is the lifeblood of a network and

01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:41,840
it's critical

01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:43,119
uh to drive uh if you want to drive a

01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,880
really intelligent

01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:46,239
agile network you've got to have lots of

01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,560
data and you also have a lot of

01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:50,560
capabilities of course we're looking

01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:52,239
to ai and machine learning type

01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,400
implementations to drive better

01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:58,159
orchestration and control

01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:58,880
and onap is a great uh platform for us

01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,719
to really

01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,639
pull that together and to start

01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:06,000
supporting that

01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:08,239
so many other open source projects

01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,320
out there also that we're engaged and i

01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:12,800
don't have the time to mention them all

01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:14,000
but i do want to thank all of the open

01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,719
source communities

01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,280
um i i do want to throw some shots out

01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:21,119
to

01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:21,119
accumo's acarano and

01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:27,679
and thank everyone for all your con

01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:28,480
contributions and i definitely want to

01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:32,560
thank uh

01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:35,440
all of you for your help and support

01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:37,040
uh to help build these projects and make

01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,880
them what they are today

01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:40,080
so with that uh our pen i'll turn it

01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,440
back to you yeah

01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:44,000
no this is awesome andre every time you

01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,199
say

01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,960
and give us insights it's just

01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:50,719
out of the world right like and you know

01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,199
the very fact that

01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:54,480
exactly a year ago march 10th is when

01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:56,320
you got the spike

01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:57,679
it's just been a year fantastic so i

01:51:56,320 --> 01:52:00,000
don't know did you plan that or

01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:02,400
something i was like oh

01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:06,239
i'm like oh it's it's a year's

01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:08,560
anniversary of the atnt spike now

01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:09,840
no not at all but there are so many

01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:12,800
questions i'm going to

01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,119
have couple a time for a couple um that

01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,159
are

01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:17,599
very relevant the first one being uh how

01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:20,239
is atnt aligning

01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:21,119
org changes uh given the software

01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:22,560
defined world

01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:24,400
that's the first question in terms of

01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,040
skill sets and people

01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:28,080
the second question is more you know do

01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:30,880
we expect

01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:32,159
network traffic patterns uh caused by

01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:35,199
covet going back to

01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:36,560
quote normal or any different so those

01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:38,639
are kind of two i think important

01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:41,920
questions for people to understand

01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:42,480
yeah let me let me uh take the uh second

01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,199
question

01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:47,199
first and just um and i'll you know give

01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:50,159
you kind of a sneak peek you saw

01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:51,440
you know you saw the chart for 2020

01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:52,000
you're probably wondering well gee what

01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,040
happened

01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,920
you know what's happened in the last

01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:58,880
couple months um i i'll just say that

01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:02,000
the curve just keeps going up

01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:02,960
and um so and and that's probably not a

01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
surprise

01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:09,199
right um and it's

01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:12,320
it's pretty uh if you think about

01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:15,599
you know how connected our lives are

01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:17,040
um you know there's recent surveys that

01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:19,679
you know when you interview

01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,400
people they will actually say you know

01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,199
having

01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:24,320
uh internet connectivity ranks right up

01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:27,599
there with

01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:31,199
you know electricity and indoor plumbing

01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:33,040
um and in some cases i think uh

01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:34,719
when you ask sort of the younger

01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:36,480
demographic they would rather give up

01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:37,440
indoor plumbing than give up their

01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:41,119
internet

01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:44,320
so um i think demand uh

01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:47,440
we can just count on it um

01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:52,080
you know everything uh

01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:55,599
if you look at everything in your house

01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:58,880
uh what you wear wearables like i've got

01:53:55,599 --> 01:54:02,400
um appliances now uh

01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:05,199
even um you know i've seen connected now

01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:06,639
vacuum cleaners i mean it's just uh

01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:08,880
demands going up and up

01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:09,920
i would say what's also interesting a

01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,760
new phenomena

01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:17,840
we're seeing here is uplink

01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:21,280
um you know more you know typically

01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:23,119
um you know the ace asymmetric nature of

01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:25,040
traffic of downlink to uplink

01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:27,119
has sort of traditionally been ten to

01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:29,040
one we see that changing

01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:30,159
more and more where uplink is more and

01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,920
more relevant

01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:35,280
and that shouldn't be surprising right

01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:38,080
as as our lives become more connected

01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:40,400
and it's not just us you know uploading

01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:43,520
more tick tock videos or youtube videos

01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:45,040
that's certainly growing but also it's

01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:47,040
all the connected

01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:49,040
machines in our lives are that are

01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:52,239
uploading their data

01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:54,400
so we will see continued growth there um

01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:56,320
as far as the first question goes around

01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:57,599
you know just organizationally what have

01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:00,719
we done

01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:01,599
um what we've done is we've taken a lot

01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:04,639
of the

01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:06,560
uh the knowledge um and

01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:07,760
people and the tools and the systems

01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,480
within a t

01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:12,159
that were incubated incubated in this

01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:14,320
more central

01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:15,920
uh area within the network and we've

01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:18,400
actually distributed that

01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,440
out more and more into the business

01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:22,480
units

01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:25,840
and what we've done with these tools is

01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:28,800
also enabled them so that our business

01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,480
clients within the company can take

01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:33,840
advantage of those

01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:36,880
uh them much much more

01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:40,719
within their own communities

01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:43,840
as opposed to having to you know

01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:45,760
sort of contract if you will

01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:47,280
into and have a very technical person

01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:50,719
try to describe their

01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:52,880
business problems and and work solutions

01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:54,639
what what it's all about is enabling and

01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:56,719
making that data available

01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:57,760
but also making the capabilities the

01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:00,639
tool sets

01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:01,920
that utilize that data available as well

01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:04,320
so i tell you you know

01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,520
at a high level you see a distribution

01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:08,560
of that talent

01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,440
going in all areas of the business very

01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:11,040
good very good

01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:12,800
excellent i know we are a couple of

01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:14,239
minutes over the hour

01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:16,159
there are a few other questions we'll

01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:18,800
take them offline i think there's one

01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:20,320
general uh a couple of questions on the

01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:23,679
same thread on

01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:25,360
on on the geopolitical nature of

01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,040
open source collaboration so let me

01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:28,719
handle that uh

01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:30,800
you know open source and linux

01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:33,199
foundation in general we put out several

01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:34,320
advisory notices but we are a global

01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:35,920
community

01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:37,440
and if you don't believe that you know

01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,840
join us tomorrow

01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:42,080
uh you know we have uh several of our

01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:44,159
leaders from asia talking about

01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:45,520
you know innovation and how open source

01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:47,199
builds on each other

01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:49,280
uh you know there are no country

01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:50,320
government or people boundaries when it

01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,480
comes to open source

01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:54,080
and collaboration that's what makes it

01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,599
really thriving and i know

01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:58,000
you know some of the questions were in

01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:58,800
that domain but i know we're over time

01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,840
but andre
