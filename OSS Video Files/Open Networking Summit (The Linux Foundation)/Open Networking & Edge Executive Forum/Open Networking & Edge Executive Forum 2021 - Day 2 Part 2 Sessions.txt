with uh with a company that also needs

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,840
no introduction

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
baidu and we have the chief architect of

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680

uh letting lee who has been a very

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,600
active contributor

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
to several projects in open source in

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,880
the linux foundation edge

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,960
as well as other uh umbrellas and

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,720
you know we want to you know understand

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,960
what they are thinking from

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400
from an open source and an edge

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:39,990
perspective so without

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:42,960
any further delay please welcome lady

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,640
hello everyone i'm very glad to be able

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,360
to participate

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
in this exclusive forum today i'm

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,280
learning lee

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,000
the chief architect of vital cloud iot

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,119
as a member of the rfs technology

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
steering committee

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,119
i'm very fortunate to be able to

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,159
participate in the technological

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,880
innovation of global education

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
ash computing has grown rapidly in the

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,399
past few years

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,680
from the early as a data agent service

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,840
for the iot

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,879
to a general purpose computing service

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,440
covering various

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,239
applications windows and facilities we

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,480
can see that

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
with the population of various new

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,920
computing

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,400
resources such the mobile app computing

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,080
the new kind of content delivery network

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
the boundary between the ad and the

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,959
cloud is consistently become blurred

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,840
by moving towards to an era where

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
computing

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,040
is ubiquitous and workloads from the

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920
edge

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,319
are going fusion with the cloud we can

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,800
see

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,680
in many real cases companies collect

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
data

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
in the cloud and train models and then

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,760
use these models

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
to perform a real-time data processing

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,519
at the app

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
this means that the app is becoming

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,519
combined with the

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
cloud to become a single integrated

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,920
service

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,040
what i want to share with you today is

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,760
how the beetle product and the of the rf

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
edge

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,800
connects the edge and the cloud together

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
so

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,640
next page please okay

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,519
first let me briefly introduce the beta

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,239
product

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
beta organized from the enchanted edge

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,400
product

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,159
incubated by baidu in 2017

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,519
and then in the next year we decided to

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,720
open source it and

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000
successfully join the nfs community in

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,360
2019.

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
today beetle has grown into an open and

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,599
vendor neutral product as one of the

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,319
earliest open source products

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,560
in exploring at computing vito has

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,720
already got a bunch of features

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,799
veto can now provide a micro service

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,920
orchestration in various iot

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,080
environments

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,640
and can seamlessly extend cloud

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,599
applications and data to users private

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,560
networks

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,879
and private network equipment and

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,840
provide a containerized application

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,959
operating environments for all types of

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,720
equipment

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,200
you can visit the product home page

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,400
retail.io for more technical information

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,400
and next page please

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,919
the visual project has set three core

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,079
development goals for itself

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,040
corresponding to the applications the

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
management

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
and the developers in terms of

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,960
applications

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,000
reader's goal is to bring a standard and

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,199
open cloud native

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,080
environment for all ad screeners so that

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,440
applications

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,759
can be freely deployed and run according

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,199
to

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,400
their actual needs without adoption

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,960
and modification the stacked goal is to

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
allow

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,360
equipment to operate automatically

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,479
and at unattended conditions

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,680
through real time and through the remote

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,080
management and configuration and even

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,120
can be able to make independent

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,840
decisions and

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,360
collaborate with each other when the

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,320
environment and the data

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,320
change the final goal is to provide

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
developers with end-to-end application

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,000
development tools

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,199
and services to promote the further

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,479
innovation development

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,199
of edge computing and

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,199
next page please

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,160
in the past years vito has made great

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,800
progress

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
we have released an important 2.0

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,639
version

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,280
which will enable us to move further

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,400
towards beetle's ultimate goal

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,880
in beetle 2.0 we have introduced

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
a standard kubernetes environment for

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,280
edge devices

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
applications can be defined in the form

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,479
of

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,360
resources such as pause service and

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,720
deployment

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,360
just like what you do in the cloud

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,479
people will accept these definitions

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
from the cloud

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,840
save it to the local storage and

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
manipulate and

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,720
manipulate local kubernetes in the

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,440
local cluster in fact all services

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,840
including the veto system itself are

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,360
cloud native

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,759
beetle runs as a kubernetes service

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,560
and we have implemented the self

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,440
upgrading

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,400
with the kubernetes way in beta 2.1

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
at the same time we continue to support

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,520
the

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
docker and non-container barrel process

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,960
models

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,080
this for the low-end equipment

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,000
and introduce an experimental in windows

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,479
environment support

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
vito is working hard to continuously

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,639
expand the range of

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
device support and provide develop

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,560
developers

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,120
with more different choices

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
another important feature that will

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,960
release the

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,160
beetle cloud this is a completely

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,199
open source remote management system

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,280
you can use beta cloud's open api to

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,319
realize the configuration

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,400
software upgrade application deployment

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
and the data collection and

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
synchronization

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,080
for various edge devices

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,919
visual cloud can directly connect with

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,120
your kubernetes control plane

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,520
to obtain resource definitions and send

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,280
them

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,680
to beetle with a secure network channel

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,639
with the cooperation between beetle and

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,199
bitter cloud

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,039
the edge and the cloud are connected

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,840
together

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
next page please

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,400
so here is the architecture of beetle

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
bitter cloud is located in the upper

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,720
part

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,919
you can find that the whole

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,400
beetle cloud itself runs as

00:07:51,919 --> 00:08:00,160
a service in kubernetes and

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,599
the vito cloud connect to the kubernetes

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,319
api server so

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,039
by this design the vital cloud can

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,360
receive

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,720
all your kubernetes configurations

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,520
and try to stand it synchronize it

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,520
to your local edge instances

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,680
and the vito itself is located in the

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,960
lower part of the picture

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,520
and v2 and beta

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,719
maintaining the connection with both the

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,320
beta cloud

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:40,000
and its own kubernetes cluster

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,919
so in logical the local kubernetes

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,399
clutter and the cloud kubernetes clutter

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,519
can be configured as one they are

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,040
integrated

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,959
by the company by the operation

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,839
between beetle and beta cloud

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,240
and in in this picture we found that all

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,040
the

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
original beetle services are moving

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,800
inside the

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,080
kubernetes environment in the

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,680
in the previous version the the 1.0 of

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,959
veto we run beetle as an independent

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,080
separated process out of the container

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,640
system

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
this process will operate with the

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,600
darker system

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,279
and run all the applications as the

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,399
container in docker but the

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,760
beetle itself is controlled

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,310
out of the container system so the

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,399
administrators need to

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,760
[Music]

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,680
log into your local console and

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,959
update beetle itself manually

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,399
we found that this is the first step

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,959
to support the system

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,519
but this is not our ultimate goal we

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,120
want

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,640
to make this equipment unintended

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,959
and attended so in the 2.0 we move

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,920
all the beetle system inside the

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,040
kubernetes

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,959
we define all the beetle services as far

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,279
as services and we give the pre

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,160
trivial privilege to connect with the

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,519
local

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,560
kubernetes api server with the

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,680
standard kubernetes way

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,720
and finally we can upgrade and

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,680
manipulate

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,279
all your all your workloads both the

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,399
system services

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,680
and user applications in the

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,200
same way so this is

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,480
what we do in vito 2.0 and

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,760
we found we consider this is our most

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,240
important move to our

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,240
goals so next week please

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,880
sorry and next please maybe it's not

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,920
it's a later yes this page thank you

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,800
so to achieve the

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,519
integration of the local kubernetes

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,279
cluster

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,079
and the remote remote cloud kubernetes

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,360
cluster

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,160
there is the still an issue to uh

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,399
to solve the most critical issue is how

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,600
to maintain data consistency

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,640
between the cloud and the edge and an

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,959
unstable network conditions because most

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,399
of

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,760
your edge equipment is deployed

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,040
around the world there won't be a

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,839
very stable and high quality

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
cable network connected with connected

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,360
to

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,560
your to a to a data center

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,160
we use the unreliable network

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:56,800
maybe the the maybe the 4g

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,720
or even the even the

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,320
the more lower bandwidth network

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,160
connections

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,399
so there will be data consistency

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
issues when you're when you're

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,240
configuring

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,360
your cloud the data is not

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
not synchronized to the ad side

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,279
successfully

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,839
so they will run in different kind

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,079
different

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,040
view of your configurations that will

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,040
make

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,480
data correction so we have to

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:32,560
solve this issue this is the

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,800
shadow crd technology proposed by vito

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,480
in this technology we combine the

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,600
user-defined resource

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,519
of kubernetes with the digital twin

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,519
of iot together the formal one the crd

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,440
guarantees the integration with

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,240
kubernetes environment

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,680
so all your operations will go to the

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,519
kubernetes way

00:12:51,680 --> 00:13:00,240
and and the later one

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,279
will get the exact exactly once

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,000
qos requirement through the mqtg

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,760
protocol

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,959
and the desire and the report semantics

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,800
so let me show how this works

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,959
in the picture on the right to the

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,480
typical edge cloud synchronization

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,040
process

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,920
first the beta cloud connects to the

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,279
kubernetes api server and the cloud

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,560
obtains the deployment resource and

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,279
pack them into a shadow object we call

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,399
the

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,680
desired object and then

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,639
sends them that sends the desired shadow

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,160
object

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,959
to the edge through the mqtt protocol

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,000
the mqtt protocol itself includes the

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,160
capabilities

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,639
such as the error checking and the

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,120
network retransmissions

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:56,320
and fulfills the quality of service

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,440
by using the mqtt photographer

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,399
the desired shadow object will

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,920
successfully

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,360
be transmitted to the app side

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,079
the f side by receiving the shutter

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,360
object

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,760
at the f side the beetle will unpack it

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,480
and send the original crd definitions

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,160
to the local kubernetes cluster for the

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,279
deployment

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,720
after the deployment is achieved

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,560
the new state of which reflects

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,399
all your configurations of your

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,000
applications and the

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:37,279
data will be collected by beetle

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,279
from the local kubernetes api server

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,880
and packed again as a shadow object

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,320
we call this shadow object as the report

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,600
and we send this report shadow object

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,360
by the mqtt protocol again to the

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,880
cloud and in the cloud the b2

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,240
cloud system will unpack the report

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,959
shadow object and reflect all the

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,000
changes

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,519
from the edge to the cloud this

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,320
will show the data consistency issue

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,519
through an unstable network this is the

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,800
shadow crd technology of beetle

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,800
and next page please

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,600
so finally let me introduce the beatles

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,959
roadmap in 2021

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,560
the first and most important is we will

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,680
continue to work hard

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,759
to achieve a deeper integration of

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,759
edge and cloud together and ultimately

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,079
we'll use a single control plan to

00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,279
manipulate

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:51,360
all your workloads yet our

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,560
imagine in our think final in the future

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,000
in the future all your workloads

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,759
can be controlled and be declared

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,160
controlled and observated in a single

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,279
kubernetes dashboard

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,240
so this is our final goal

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,639
and we will make it make it make it

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,759
better in 2021

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,040
and how to make this happen the first

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,880
uh important step is to strengthen

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,399
the observation and the measurement of

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,759
x and status we will send

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,040
the add house data and application

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,720
runtime runtime metrics data

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:42,079
to the cloud to provide a better

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,079
better capability for the operations

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,279
in addition we will work with the

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,680
ocrino community to explore how to use

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,959
the

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,399
mobile edge compute computing by

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,600
5g network to implement

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,959
a better low latency services for new

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,640
kind of

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:08,000
new kind of applications such like the

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,039
like the other driving or the vrs or all

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,760
the cloud

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:18,559
gaming and we'll try to

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,600
try to try to research how to

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,079
serve a moving use

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,199
a moving application by your mobile

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,960
phone or by

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,600
other mobile mobile devices

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,440
that's when we move across different

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,640
base stations are fighting at

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,320
5g networks the application should

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,640
go with the device go to keep

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,520
low latency with your applications so

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,480
that

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,600
so this means the application maybe will

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,960
be

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,480
roaming between base stations or roaming

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,799
with the mec

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,919
data centers of 5g networks

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,880
this may be uh i think this is a very

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,200
interesting things

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,000
and we will try to explore how to

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,440
achieve this

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,360
in this year at the same time will

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,840
strengthen the construction of

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,160
documents and to attract more

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,520
contributors

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,520
interesting beta products

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,880
and we are going to collaborate with

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,919
more more chipset services chipset

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,280
providers

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:33,440
and more infrastructure providers

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,640
to support not only the the x68

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,840
chipsets the arms chipset may be the

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,960
risk survived

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,000
to them in the in the future and we are

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,120
going to

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,080
collaborate with more rf edge coming

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,960
communities such as address foundry and

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,000
rhino

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,200
to make more corporations

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,720
okay next page please

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,400
okay this route will be reflected

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,720
in our static detail works

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
the most important thing is the

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,320
cooperation

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,679
with communities we are working with the

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,720
ajax fundraise

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,160
to bring an open source iot solution to

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
beetle so users can define your iot

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
system

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:24,400
in the cloud and test it and

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,559
deploy it to all your edge devices

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
and we're trying to work with the flash

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,679
community

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,320
to introduce more industry screeners

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,280
to accept more industry protocols and

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,240
the data

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,520
to the app system and connect them with

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,559
the new technology

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,160
like the data like the data processing

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,200
or the artificial intelligence

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,400
i believe that with the joint efforts of

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,360
the community

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000

so what the little folks down

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,720
i think in the open world we will still

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,240
continue

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:24,480
contributing on the 5g related

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,679
specifications and also in the

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,640
open world we work on the contributing

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,840

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,440
general efficient flexible flat

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,440
platform and frameworks

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,399
and also in 2020 we have joined the

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,840
risk of risk of five and

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:51,760
also we support

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:55,200
china mobile to initiate the extremely

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,320
project which we think is very important

we will continue support annuket

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:15,760
and try to get the page to certify

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,760
our products in the next year

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,720
please go to next page

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,399
in this page i want to introduce our

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,000
product

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,600
on the 5g private

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,799
one-stop 5g provide a private

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,799
provide networking

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,919
which can pro enabling in all

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:50,960
industry we have two uh

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:54,080
three different kinds of configurations

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,600
from left to right is

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,919
first first one is the dual like high

00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,519
configuration

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:05,279
it consists of two cabinet

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:08,079
one for the network one for the cloud

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,919
in a cloud cabinet we provide a date

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,280
middleware

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,639
and ai middleware and also video

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,639
and age

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,879
it is suitable for big enterprise

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:30,560
and headquarters of the

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,520
end users in the middle is an integrated

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,200
cabinet

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,919
which indicates the cloud with the

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,919
network

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:46,079
it's a must it's it's more efficient

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,879
and it's a

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,679
it's suitable for the enterprise branch

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,919
and

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:57,119
some campus and also we provided a

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,400
simple configuration which is a single

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,640
shelf

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,960
and it's most cost

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,960
less

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,079
all of this config regulation provide

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,119
you

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,359
cloud and network conveniency

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:21,359
and also the the fixed and the mobile

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,480
network and with full access to

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,119
different kinds of

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,119
connections

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,400
and also we support multiple computing

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,280
communities

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,280
with different types of computing

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:48,400
next slide

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,760
this slide we show a ynxity common age

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,800
for scenario mac which provide

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,440
you the mac tenants with self-service

00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,960
information

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,760
and provided the operator the ability to

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,880
unify

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,640
cloud management

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,800
this is a one-stop deployment

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:16,160
and we use the embedded the mac

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:21,040
pre-integrated mac and also crowded film

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:24,839
for mac and also this one

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,000
solutions let's get to the layer one two

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,000
three

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
award in last year

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,240
at the end please go to the next slide

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,040
today i think we

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,560
can discuss some challenges and

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:48,880
opportunities lies before us

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:55,119
since we know most vertical industries

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:58,320
has recognized the power of ict

00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,079
especially on 5g h cloud

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,480
and ai this can help them

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,480
increase their productivity and

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,599
efficiency

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,040
at the same time but they also failed

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,800
the trade

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,839
for the industry disruptions this can be

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,359
a challenge

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,320
and also uh opportunities

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,079
and also for the covered knighting

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,000
pandemic

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:31,119
we think it's already changed our life

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,839
and work maybe

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,640
forever working from home has been

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,560
verified valid

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,160
both in our company and also in most

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:48,000
other industries and also

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:51,920
traveling has been limited until

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,520
vaccine were used worldwide

00:37:51,920 --> 00:38:01,280
i think this will uh takes a long time

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,640
i'm looking for that we can and meet

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,119
in person in the future in the very near

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,119
future

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,079
but in my own works i found

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,440
a lot of product people don't think

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,280
an open source could make money profit

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,800
for for them

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,160
how do you deal with them on this

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,480
how do you persuade them to trust

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:35,839
open source and make them believe

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:39,119
the open source thank you

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,960
excellent very good very good

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,640
uh first of all you know i have to

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,839
congratulate you

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,520
that you know all the various projects

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,079
and various umbrellas that you have been

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,440
participating collaborating and leading

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,760
in a lot of instances with uh with your

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,680
team of technical people and your and

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,720
yourself so thank you very much for

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,480
for doing that um i think

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,119
the the overall business model on open

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,119
source is

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,800
fairly mature now i think you heard from

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,440
rakuten and others

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,560
as well as uh you know you can see from

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,560
the partnership

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,880
that the carriers have uh provided

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,040
in terms of going through the vendors

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,599
versus just doing it themselves right so

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,920
i think

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,880
that the things have settled down quite

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,720
well

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,680
so very good thank you very much thank

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,760
you for doing this

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,920
okay thank you all right thank you okay

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,680
very good excellent and now for the

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,200
final presentation

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,320
uh a very important one because

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,040
i do believe that uh you know what

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,320
what china mobile says uh you know the

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,599
world has to listen

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,280
you know it's the largest carrier lots

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,280
of research going on

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,480
lots of very very smart people and we

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,599
have one of them to

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,640
speak to us today and so without any

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,040
further delay

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,079
uh you know i do want to welcome dr fang

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,680
um

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,240
you know chief scientist and general

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,040
manager of china mobile research

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,760
and i would you know we will love to

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,920
understand

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,160
where things are where you see things

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,640
going what we should all be looking for

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:25,839
so

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:25,839
dr fang take it away

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,240
hello um

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
this will be interesting i don't see you

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,440
but you can see me

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,280
um we'll see how how this will work

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,560
was very happy and and to to see our bit

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,680
to know we have about

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:58,560
over a thousand

00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,800
engineers and practitioners join us

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,800
today i will not only talk about china

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,920
mobile i just have one slides

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,119
so pretty much is how i see how we see

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,800
the

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:14,079
the entire industry how that goes so

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,960
move on to so continue to talk about

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,920
the topic here is network intelligence

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,960
and

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,839
um i see not china mobile

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,920
probably across the entire industry not

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,560
just our industry other industries

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,359
by increasing their investment on

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,800
intelligence

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:37,280
how to intelligent by the

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,920
internal management internal operation

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,720
across various industry so today i will

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,760
cover

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,640
uh a few aspects so i limit myself to 50

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
minutes

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,400
what's the motivation talk about what

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,440
what are the main drivers

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,960
what are the typical approaches um

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,880
companies are taking to making

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,000
the business making the operation

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,200
intelligent

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,480
second is uh um how uh

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:09,680
our observation and

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,680
then i will move on to share

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,920
a survey around conducted by eoag

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,040
in the can in this community see how the

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,000
community says

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,040
about the stage of their narrow

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
intelligence

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,000
and i will give a few suggestions next

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,760
so um this one is the motivation

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,760
uh

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,760
since um these i have lots of small

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,520
fonts

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,640
i've opened up for my own version um

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,520
so there's a couple um motivators i'm

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,040
thinking

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:54,400
um are driving us uh

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,800
to transform towards intelligent network

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,079
and the and the lower layer is the

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,200
network

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,880
itself it's um before we have the

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,160
wireless so we have the core we have the

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,480
transmission network

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,599
now this the whole structure is changed

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,880
you have a basic

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,640
infrastructure and that layer um

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,440
and then you have the bmf cnf

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,520
and you have the operation layer then we

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,720
have the businesses service layer

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,280
um for for

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,520
us and how we see the industry i'm

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,040
thinking that operation

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:35,040
intelligence now is the core if you

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,960
uh if we read all the reports from the

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:42,079
agencies and a couple sdos

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,800
we can see the strength where the foot

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,319
and then

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,240
this current stage where the

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,240
intelligence efforts goes to

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,920
it's a pretty much focuses on the middle

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,280
layer the operation

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,400
layer um so it promotes

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,359
um the the transformation to

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,040
uh further improve the efficiency and

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,240
the lower the cost

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,640
and also you know we have to

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:12,160
they scale up the network and

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:16,000
the the data volume network um

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,400
is increasing dramatically how we can in

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,359
you know operate that network at the

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,560
same time

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,560
maintain lower costs

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,560
then we wanna we here we see the trend

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,920
is

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,960
taking that layer as the core a base

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,400
down layer

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,359
then um synchronize the efforts with the

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,079
lower layer they

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,880
the network itself um become more

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,119
intelligent

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,920
also the the service and the business

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,280
layer

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,599
um for the top layer we see a trend as

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,359
for the typical applications of a 5g

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,560
people are proposing are

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,599
are deploying and also the typical

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,200
applications of

00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:00,560
5g the ai and larger scale

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,680
over 85 percent are

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,800
are overlapped so basically

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,839
before we plan we build

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,119
we optimize our network for

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:16,640
uh for voice of vip

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,760
for data uh for

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,359
talking over phone now it's the

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,040
um i think it in the applications

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:30,800
with uh intelligence as a key feature

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,599
are the the uh probably one of the

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,680
biggest

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,599
services we have to support well so

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,280
as a key feature of intelligence

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,560
applications they have to be

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,040
flexible has to be

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,079
closed loop maintenance so that will

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,400
require the network

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,720
that you have the same feature so our

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,880
current network is not as flexible as

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,000
the applications i hope we are

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,359
um so that's the the service layer so we

00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,760
can

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,800
hopefully one day we can users give

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,640
their intent

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,720
we can we can control our network to

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,160
serve the intent

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:14,400
to improve the customer experience

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:17,760
for the second the operation layer

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,400
i can see the trends in the

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,920
standard organizations in open source

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,760
our open source community

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,079
and the other open source community and

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,160
also in the research literature

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,119
lots of great work are coming out on

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,839
this layer

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,359
um how we can further control the cost

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,280
improve the efficiency

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,560
and in terms of network of the lower

00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,760
layer um

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,240
there are a couple of things one is for

00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,400
the network elements each network

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,800
element has their key functions

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,720
and some of those functions have been

00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,920
changed because of the intelligence

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,160
technologies that we have

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,119
as of today and then the other one is

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,079
the interface

00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,599
between the network elements since we

00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,800
have this technology

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,280
the way the interfaces

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,520
between the network elements are

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,640
changing

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,640
so next slide

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,680
so this one probably looks quite

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,780
complicated on the left to side

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,720
is the um

00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:20,240
[Music]

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,680
the campfire's forum and they show how

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,880
we need a few closed loop in order to

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,280
keep our operation intelligent so

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,000
so here you see there uh three loops

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,640
they

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,359
we need to have once we have a business

00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,480
intent

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,520
that translates to a service intent

00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,559
and network intent and transit to

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,280
resource

00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,480
intent and the data and then come back

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,599
we need to keep

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,559
a promise we can provide that service

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,280
with the high quality that's the kpi and

00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,079
and this

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,359
and this sla feedback and then the

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,160
customer

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,800
experience assurance so that's the big

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,079
loop

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,359
and in in this whole circle um you see

00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,400
there is a

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,640
horizontal circle which is the business

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,400
automatic closed loop and the service

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,119
automatic closed loop and the resource

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,240
to control

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,040
closed loop so that's um pretty much

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,599
that

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,040
one of the key feature of artificial

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,160
intelligence applications

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:25,359
is you cannot have a product and

00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,839
without touch it for long it has to be

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,520
in a loop and then the model has to be

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,359
upgraded

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,359
and the data has to be continuously

00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:36,800
processed so it's

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:40,240
um i call it's something uh itself

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:43,440
has it's it's a life being versus a

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:46,160
a product um the traditional product

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,480
which you you buy a cup the cup stays on

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,000
the

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,960
on your table um so on the right side

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,319
um let's just open up how different

00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,480
parts are connected

00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:00,640
so now we can see for the sdos

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,520
they have laid out lots of efforts

00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,040
almost

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:08,079
every single uh our standard

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,960
organization has to put in lots of work

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,160
in various forms to push the network to

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,720
be intelligent

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,079
so in this graph you see you have the

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,839
pink one is the local

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,680
ai so for the wireless zooming the run

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,599
uh transformation network and the core

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,720
network and each domain

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,960
there's specific efforts in that domain

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,200
um for the we here i show this as a

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,800
local ai

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:38,160
but i'm proposing here is

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,640
the if we hope we can

00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,119
provide the service which as uh

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,640
intelligence as the

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:49,440
business hope we can support now we need

00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,960
also a general intelligence layer that's

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,000
the right side

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,839
so which can cross and this

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,520
from the top all the way to the bottom

00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,839
so we need to have that view

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,880
so in order to have the overall

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,920
optimization

00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:07,359
optimization target versus

00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,440
we optimize in each specific domain

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,040
and about we don't have the overall

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,240
picture that's

00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:19,040
um will make the whole network

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:22,480
fall into a local optimum versus a uh

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:27,839
end-to-end intelligence

00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,839
operation so next slide

00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,760
next to one please

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,920
um this next slides i'll just talk about

00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:46,160
oh should i go back to

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,000
go back to the open source yeah yeah

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,520
thank you so this is a quite you can see

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,480
the pictures are quite similar to the

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,079
one before just

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,920
showing where um our community the the

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,640
software the projects that we're putting

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,760
where

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,880
we see them on the overall picture we

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,160
see the owner

00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,200
it's it's especially just taking on apex

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,480
example

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:11,200
it's very a key component um

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,040
for to assure the business intelligence

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,400
and the service in tennessee layer

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,400
so we have acumen so on up we have pnda

00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,000
i hope we can increase that efforts in

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,400
that layer because

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,760
the operation intelligence some i'm

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,400
thinking and current stage

00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,160
will be the driver for the top layer and

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,559
the lower layer intelligence

00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,200
and so we see now i change this on up

00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,839
also

00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:38,000
closely work with the open ram

00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:40,960
um now work with the rick

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,960
to help

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:50,480
configure and orchestrate intelligently

00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:53,920
in that specific domain

00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,000
for the infrastructure layer um

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,240
we see there are a couple standards come

00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,839
out

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:05,680
for fed ai which is quite hot

00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:10,160
it's a i think it's a uh that standard

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:14,000
was passed in nigeria i i ieee

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,400
last year 2019 it basically redefines

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,240
how machine learning can learn a model

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,000
without

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:25,520
the risk of data security

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,559
this is next one go to

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,599
the survey eog

00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,599
next slides please

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:38,559
okay um sorry i have a cold today

00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:41,200
so this is a

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,839
initiated proposed by china mobile was

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,480
conducted

00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:49,599
by of and uag uh so so far we got

00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,960
65 c feedbacks from

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,680
20 telecom operators

00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,440
more than 10 digital service providers

00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,040
and over 30 vendors

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:04,160
so we can quickly go through the data

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,160
so overall um looks like

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,599
we're asking that questions where you

00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,720
see we are

00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,720
in terms of intelligence level um

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,400
we can see the most companies think

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,599
they're at l1

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,640
out or l2 so it's a level one on level

00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,559
two so so we are

00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:25,440
at the preliminary stage and uh

00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,800
and see where the the applications and

00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,319
and the research

00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:34,079
uh so that's also after the pilot stage

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:37,040
which is the work has to hand so see

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,240
um that topic as network intelligence

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,240
has become quite

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,800
a hot topic now in the research

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,680
community from thinking as the industry

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,200
we're still

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,960
we're starting doing that um for the r

00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:54,000
d um you can see how how the

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,200
intelligence the a development and the

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
deployment

00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,839
how who should be the one to do the work

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,599
uh how they

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:07,280
the operators see this picture

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:10,480
so we can for the proof of concept

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,599
and pilots you can see the

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:17,599
percentile for the on the right side

00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:20,800
and the first picture and the second pi

00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:24,079
graph it shows

00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:27,599
the percentage of self-development

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,160
and rely on partners rely on big

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,160
partners

00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:36,559
and the small partners um

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:39,599
so here um i have a couple of

00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,839
conclusions and uh for now

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,200
from the survey so the more than 50

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,520
operators think

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,960
they are doing the intelligence of

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,680
platform on their own

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,000
to the south developed and the more than

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,359
uh

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,160
two or two thirds three

00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,520
two thirds of the operators who think um

00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,799
they are also doing their own

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,079
applications too

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:05,200
just to share well this data we have

00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,119
on the analysis i'm thinking some of the

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,200
conclusions aligned with our

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:12,960
observations some are not

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:15,599
so we will continue to have a new ways

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,280
to know where or while we are in terms

00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,880
of the whole industry

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:23,040
um since the time

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,079
almost i use up all my 50 minutes i will

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,520
quickly go through

00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:30,640
the suggestions so i suggest uh for the

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,799
three slides the first one is or hope

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:37,280
we can um carry out a top-level design

00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,000
for platform uh function and the

00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,040
management

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,680
architecture so how we can build the

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,280
the overall in the general of all

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,559
general intelligence

00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,799
across the layers uh on the right side

00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,799
and the build and intelligence and the

00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:56,400
open industry

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,720
cooperation platform and we also need to

00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,319
work

00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:03,040
closely with sdos and also other

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,200
cross organizations also work with the

00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,760
ai

00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,760
companies

00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:15,359
and for our fm

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,680
work well in inside our community we

00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,440
hope

00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,480
we can take operation intelligence

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,200
that's the core

00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,240
and then we take that as a driver to

00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,079
drive the

00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,400
intelligence transformation and the

00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:32,160
service layer and also the

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,960
the the network uh element layer

00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,640
uh so we draw this two graphs and then

00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,319
one is the surface intelligence and the

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,440
other one's the lower layer

00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:44,640
hopefully that's our uh just suggestion

00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,599
maybe uh maybe it's right maybe it's not

00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,599
to see the path

00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:52,720
the last one is i'm thinking it's in

00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,760
order to make our network

00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,480
intelligent data has to be flexible um

00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,359
to be flexible it's not enough we have

00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,160
certain

00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,559
amount of network operation knowledge we

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,960
have

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,079
certain set of data we also need an

00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,520
environment

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,520
an environment which can

00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:17,280
which can be a um resembled

00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,280
or uh um

00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:24,319
or experimental uh place and

00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,520
uh developers and algorithm researchers

00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,720
they all can

00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:30,160
put in their model see how that work so

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,760
without

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,160
a simulation environment i'm thinking

00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,599
it's pretty hard for me the intelligence

00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,319
to come from

00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,799
what the intelligence of computer come

00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,839
from

00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:46,079
three resources one is data

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,280
one is knowledge and the other one is

00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,640
the environment

00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:54,799
so the model the ai algorithm the model

00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:58,079
the product has to explore the real

00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:59,200
imp environments and to improve the

00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,920
south of the

00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,640
on the flight and to to truly get

00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,359
intelligent

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,599
versus we have the offline intelligence

00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,920
but once we put in the real

00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,000
network it's always the bigger question

00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,000
mark so they are free of

00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,200
put that into network and make it a

00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,640
larger scale

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:23,280
um with that um i will

00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:26,640
finish my slides of it

00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:29,599
all right excellent thank you

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,760
dr frank so first of all you know i was

00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,079
just so engrossed in what you were

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,040
saying that i i just didn't realize that

00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,799
you know we

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,559
over there um so a couple of

00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,920
observations and there's obviously a

00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,960
couple of questions that

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,200
i want to i want you to address first so

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,200
the the one of the questions is saying

00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,200
china mobile was largely responsible for

00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,040
the cran technology which triggered the

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,960
entire 5g movement

00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,799
what are we going to do and how is china

00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,680
mobile you know thinking about

00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:02,400
once again taking a leadership position

00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:06,720
and continuing in the future

00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,680
yeah thank you for the question um

00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,839
well cram basically is it's a great

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,200
invention it changed the overall

00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:17,760
uh architecture of the brand so

00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,359
i'm thinking for now probably for i'm

00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,200
talking about the intelligence layer

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,920
we'll continue our overall efforts in

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,200
syria

00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,319
i'm thinking is if we want uh we hope

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,119
with in china mobile is invest a lot in

00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,040
in the

00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:33,040
network intelligence and the same thing

00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,000
for the for the for the rant

00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,280
so we hope that the serum give us more

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,799
opportunities that we can put

00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,880
intelligence in

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,839
um for example you have this you

00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,119
separated du

00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:46,079
and cu and between the gu and and co and

00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,319
aau

00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:52,240
um so how we can match the resources

00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:54,160
so you need something in the middle

00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,359
which is intelligent enough who can

00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,559
sense the network

00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:01,440
sense the dynamic and and automatically

00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,000
intelligently adjusted the mapping so

01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,359
that's

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,559
this eventually give the architecture

01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:12,400
give away we can put in patches in

01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:15,599
okay excellent um i think in general

01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,760
the your your overview of how standards

01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,359
and open source and network intelligence

01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,319
and all the layers couple

01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,920
they all looked very cool and i think

01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,480
with your leadership and with your

01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,640
entire

01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,400
company behind you know open source and

01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,359
standards i think we really appreciate

01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,839
the

01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,920
the support that you all have given i

01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,359
also want to publicly thank you for

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,359
being the

01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,480
the chair of the governing board of lf

01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:41,440
networking uh

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,839
all of last year uh and you know we're

01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,319
looking forward to some even more

01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:47,599
cool things from china mobile and your

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:50,480
influence globally

01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:52,960
so really appreciate you taking the time

01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,520
and uh thank you very much

01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,640
thank you i'm so happy to work with the

01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,319
community

01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,760
we have to work together changing the

01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,920
world make it better

01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,799
thank you thank you thank you there you

01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,680
go thank you

01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:06,480
excellent this ends our uh second day of

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,960
onif

01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,680
uh we will see you tomorrow morning at 7

01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,400
a.m

01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,200
pacific it'll be a little late in asia

01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,680
but

01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,559
do join in we have some very exciting

01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,760
presenters

01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,440
on the eu front uh and uh

01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,359
you know look forward to all the

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,480
recordings that come out but thank you

01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:39,839
again for joining
