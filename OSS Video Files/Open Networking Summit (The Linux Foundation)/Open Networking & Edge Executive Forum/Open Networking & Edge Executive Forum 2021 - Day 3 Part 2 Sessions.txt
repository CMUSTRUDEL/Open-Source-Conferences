eu and uh you know i hope you have

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
gotten some lunch on the east coast and

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,720
for those of you who are waking up and

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,000
joining on the west coast welcome

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,559
uh to the to the second session on day

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,120
three

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,399
uh it onif has been a such a great

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,079
success and thank you all for the

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
feedback you have been giving us on the

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
quality of speakers and the content

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,239
so we're really excited to kick this

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,200
session off i would say we're saving

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,719
absolutely the best for this session uh

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,559
some of the top-notch

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,160
leaders in the industry are going to

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,840
give us a view of

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,920
what we should all be thinking about in

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,199
2021 and beyond

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,920
and so let me kick it off by um uh

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,520
introducing our first speaker today uh

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,240
you know obviously he works at uh

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,159
ericsson which needs no introduction uh

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
a global leader there

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
unders uh rosengren is the head of

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,840
architecture and technology

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,159
at ericsson and let's see what his views

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,720
are

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,360
on what we should all be looking at so

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,360
please welcome

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
anderson

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,040
thank you very much uh harpit i think uh

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,400
always great to be here i love these

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
conferences i

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,280
and uh the combination of technology and

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,079
open source

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
and the industry ecosystem it's just

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,159
such a great place to be

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,320
so i'm here today to give some view on

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,520
on how erickson looks at the

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,399
future of 2021 as you see and going

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
forward

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,600
and we see the uh the year of 2021 as

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,399
the year of 5g

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
but also how we see edge orchestration

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,600
and

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,399
exposure that is key to develop and

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,599
deliver

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,280
on key enterprise use cases beyond

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,239
mobile broadband

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,879
so let me start by talking about some of

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,879
the

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,160
use cases and from an opportunities

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,280
as a telco operator that exists beyond

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,040
mobile broadband so

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,800
going towards b2b and b to b to x

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,480
and of course private networks comes

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,319
quite naturally

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,800
as a as an opportunity for operators

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,800
and then of course you also look at

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
combining that with edge compute

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,200
to bring on not only the private network

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
connectivity but also the

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
capability of hosting applications and

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
combining that with connectivity and

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,519
then of course

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,160
industrial iot as you see in the middle

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
here

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,560
is a great opportunity to combine those

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
capabilities of edge

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,519
and private 5g networks into addressing

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,519
low latency

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,720
and ultralight ultra high reliability

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,720
then of course big data another of these

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,280
capabilities that we will see much more

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,519
of

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,959
building on top of connectivity bringing

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,680
the data back from the

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,800
sensors from the iot systems utilize

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
utilizing that

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,959
to optimize your processes and then of

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,840
course security

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,000
i think we all know about increased uh

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,760
threat vectors but also the increased

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,480
requirements on distributed working

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,680
and the necessary functionality to be

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,640
built on top of that

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,440
so we see a lot of opportunities for

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
operators

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,680
in this space building on combining

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
connectivity with additional

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,560
applications with additional features to

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,560
deliver

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
really great service to the enterprise

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,560
and 2021

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,680
is the year to start the journey on this

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,799
from ericsson we definitely see 5g as

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,280
an uh transformative event uh

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,519
as we move forward here not just for the

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
speeds and feeds of course but really as

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,920
a connected

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,920
innovation platform for uh applications

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,760
and users and of course it starts with

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,920
key technologies that we built into the

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,120
system to really live up to the promises

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,160
of 5g

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,280
around massive imo around ai

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
around cloud native around intent and

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,880
model driven

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,639
around energy efficiency all of the

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
capabilities and the technologies that

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
we use

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,880
to build the functional characteristics

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
that make up that platform

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,400
and of course then you come to it should

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
be highly efficient of course

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,320
multi-purpose to run different type of

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,440
connectivity in applications

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,880
mobile radio access to cut the cord then

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
of course zero touch management and

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
orchestration that is close at uh at the

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,720
heart

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,000
of the uh lf networking foundation and

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,919
own app of course so that's that's

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,400
something that we really are building on

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,160
cloud native we have cncf as the sponsor

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,919
here i think that's fantastic and we see

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
how cncf is really

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,000
creating a fantastic ecosystem around

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,479
the cloud native which we are using

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,440
to build a cloud native 5g core and

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,360
delivering that

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,400
and with all the promises and

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,880
capabilities that i would need to bring

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,880
on top of that of course we see then

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,240
that this is creating a set of values

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,440
for the users

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,039
so predictable connectivity uh

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,199
distributed processing we see uh

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,360
embedded intelligence and well as well

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,800
as continue to build on that

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,840
security as a high on the on the agenda

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,039
and privacy and of course cost efficient

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,280
and with this we enable diff

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,360
the operators to address different type

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,080
of users not only the consumer

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,560
uh but definitely the industries a

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,360
larger group of peoples and and also

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,840
uh government and first responder

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,039
networks for example as different users

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,319
and combining enabling that on top of uh

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,840
this mobile network

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,840
on top of this network platform

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,319
so what kind of use cases do we see

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,160
there and what does this

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
mean if we dive a little bit deeper into

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,360
these use cases and and how

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
the uh network platform is then

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,199
supporting that

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
so if we start with uh warehouses and

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,400
factories i think

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
manufacturing and digitalization of the

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,759
manufacturing space has been

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,080
very high on the agenda down to the

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,880
right here you see smart manufacturing

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,840
ericsson has

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,479
uh the first uh automated factory in

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
texas

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,080
uh uh coming came online end of last

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,319
year

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
and we see there the requirements are

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,720
are quite stringent of course

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,560
it's for on-prem edge we see that that

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,680
is a necessity there combining with

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,800
connectivity

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,639
a lot of access points in

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,599
a lot of sim devices or different users

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,400
uh conveyor belts for example a lot of

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,199
robots and

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,840
and not just the uh manufacturing robots

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
but of course

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,440
also uh automated guided vehicles for

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,000
example transporting stuff between them

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,120
all of them require low latency and high

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,840
reliability

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,160
to to secure the service video

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,560
surveillance and different applications

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,080
operations technology applications

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,440
running on top of that edge

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,599
connecting and interacting with the

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,800
connectivity through a set of exposed

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,479
services

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,319
brings the key benefits around

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,919
connectivity and applications of course

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,960
centralized management

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,240
security data privacy and

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,280
ultra low latency another one

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,840
and a rather different use case

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,960
is then that you actually do what to

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,599
bring the technology

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
out of the business so you want a very

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,039
smooth

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,879
and quick pop-up store established you

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,199
don't want a lot of

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,720
on-prem i.t equipment and connectivity

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,360
equipment so you want a

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,319
simple connectivity and you want the

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,120
operator

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,759
to host that connectivity for you so

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,199
having

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
uh then still low latency is important

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,240
uh high bandwidth is is definitely

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,919
important as well

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,440
security and to reduce the on-premise

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,879
cost etc so i think

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,560
these are the two examples of use cases

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,360
two examples of benefits that the

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,400
combination of connectivity

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,840
and applications edge that brings that

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
to the enterprises and that the

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,639
operators can really benefit from using

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,840
and implementing

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
if we move on then uh from this and talk

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,240
a little bit

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,919
more about the network as a platform i

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,599
think that will also be

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,159
a word of 2021 and going forward where

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,360
we see how we put things like network

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,000
slicing in place

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,760
or we put things like edge combining

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,080
with connectivity and i think

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,680
we we definitely and i think in in the

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,120
telco industry sometimes get a little

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,279
bit too nerdy we are

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
super fascinated about 3dpp and

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,760
different

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,600
apis and complex ways but we also know

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,959
that the application developers on top

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
of this they are no

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,040
they are not 3dpp experts they want a

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,839
simple api that they can easily

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,560
understand

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,440
and utilize to connect to the network

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
and build

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
there to utilize the capabilities for

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,920
example

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,000
latency resiliency

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,760
reliability security other things that

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
they can get out of the network

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,320
and embed as features and support for

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,920
their application that they are building

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
so they want simple apis

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,680
they want those apis exposed into the

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,880
development environment

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,000
but they also want the apis for

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,000
partner onboarding consumer onboarding

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,560
and the operator needs of course to

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
provide capabilities towards the users

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,440
the enterprise for

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,279
self-service portals etc below that api

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
for external integration there is a set

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,920
of automation and orchestration

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,560
machinery

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,279
to orchestrate the workloads in the

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
network

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,120
in the mobile network as well as the

00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
third-party applications to bring

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,240
together

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,240
a set of end-to-end services and below

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,600
that of course the network components

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,360
as well as the cloud platforms on edge

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,079
and central

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,600
provided from a hybrid and multi-cloud

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,279
perspective

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,959
so here we definitely see the need

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,519
of abstracting and presenting a

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,880
reliable and simple and easy-to-use set

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,959
of apis

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,200
as well as the capability of course to

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,160
orchestrate and expose the capabilities

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
and the

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,680
features and the network functions at

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
the place that they should be whether

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,360
that's on-prem

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,720
with the enterprise on the network edge

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,760
or central to deliver

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,839
certain types of of kpis and and

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,839
maintain slas for the enterprise

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,279
but it's of course then an open source

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,079
conference and i

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,640
i think i'm as i said in the beginning

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,040
here

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,000
uh super excited to be here and we see

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,600
definitely

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,920
of course this ecosystem being built

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,240
through a set of standards uh whether

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,200
it's 3dpp for the network functions or

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,320
tm forum for the apis that are needed to

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,480
interact and create a multi-user

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
and multi-vendor environment an easy

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,320
integration environment

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
we also see the industry alliances and

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
that come back to

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,560
comes back to the need from a telco

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,640
industry to listen to the

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,079
enterprises and the application builders

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,640
that are going to use that

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,200
that's so important to listen for

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,200
example we work in 5g aci

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,720
together with a set of manufacturing

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
hindu specialists

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
they give their requirements on the api

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,600
this is the functionality we

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
want to access this is the way we want

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,560
to access it

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,640
and this is what we need to know when

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,880
this is what you need to abstract away

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,079
so that is a super important and then of

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,959
course we see

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,000
open source helping us building the

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,560
foundation

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,240
building this in in an open and

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,480
collaborative way and of course

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
linus foundation edge and networking are

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,680
our key parts here

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,920
as i said cloud native compute

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,800
foundation as well it's also

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,320
an of course a very integral and and

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,440
important part

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,760
of this whole solution oran

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,279
and onap are bringing different types of

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,959
uh

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,040
com capabilities and of course ericsson

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,600
sees the value of this sees the value of

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,320
engaging and using open source

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
together with our our proprietary logic

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,880
to create the

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,480
the full end to end solution

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:42,399
so finally then i uh when i

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,000
spoke inside the ericsson and

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,839
collaborated with a set of the people

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,680
that are engaged in open source i

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,040
asked them okay what what kind of

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,600
message what kind of

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,320
call for actions do you see as important

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
here

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,880
how do we make open source lead the way

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,480
even more here to build

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,360
the necessary foundation for for the

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,160
operators and for the telco equipment

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,279
vendors

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,120
to deliver on the requirements of

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,800
enterprises to really make

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,920
5g the transformational event and and

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,639
we came with three uh three topics here

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,240
i think we see with cloud native and

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,360
definitely a need to

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:28,399
move much faster and quicker towards the

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,279
cloud-native way of working so

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,560
integrating orchestration and management

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,320
of the resources

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,920
together with the software lifecycle

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,240
management and svdp

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,360
and here we see onap and the cdf

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
foundation

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,720
that there is we we really want to

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,639
continue to drive

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,639
that collaboration and that integration

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,600
to really maintain that

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,560
and improve that collaboration and bring

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
additional features here to the industry

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
then i think we we are working in a

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,440
multi-vendor reality and we see

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,000
kubernetes being a foundational element

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,120
but we also see that there is no

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,600
aligned view today so creating a common

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,360
kubernetes profile from a cncf

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,959
to really drive simplification and

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,639
efficiency uh

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,320
in the ecosystem and industry when

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,040
you're orchestrating

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,720
different workloads across different uh

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,360
kubernetes alternatives

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,760
that that will be uh an important way

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
for

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,839
open source to support the industry and

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
then i think

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,320
increased collaboration not only inside

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,600
a specific open source project but

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,000
between them and i think

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
we have an example here of a d map and

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,959
and

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,079
secure an alignment there with kafka and

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,240
minio

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,399
instead of maintaining bespoke

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,959
functionality inside onap so

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,240
really urging the the open source

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,760
community to start

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
even better i know you are working on

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,160
that already and we are working on that

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,279
but really that

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,320
even better uh collaborate across

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,040
to build that full end-to-end system in

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,560
the best and

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:04,560
most efficient way so with that

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,120
i i close my uh talk here uh thank you

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
very much

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,399
for listening to me all right thank you

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,360
anders this is very insightful i think

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,240
your

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,360
your end-to-end view of pulling in you

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,720
know core

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,240
edge access you know enterprise telcos

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,600
cloud kind of bringing it all

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,880
has really really uh you know resonated

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,399
i like the call to action also uh there

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,079
there are a few questions that have come

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,959
in uh i think the first one

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,079
i would ask is uh there's a project

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,680
anuket

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,800
where uh there's ra2 that defines

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,000
common kubernetes profiles for telcos uh

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,120
would you see

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
uh uh you know cncf helping with that

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
directly

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
um and and getting there or do you see

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
something else on

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,680
on that um in in reference to your

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,560
kubernetes uh

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,880
yeah yeah so so that very very good and

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,480
i think here we we are engaged in in

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,079
aniket uh um and the the two different

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,800
produce that it came out of

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,160
so we definitely see that as a good a

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
good base but also

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,440
of course inside c and cf and we have

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,680
the

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,279
the cnf work group there so definitely

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,720
joining forces between

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,120
undercut and cncf here would be a real

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,079
really important way forward awesome

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,399
very good

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,240
and again i think i don't have to

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,519
mention this but uh

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,519
uh you know you you and

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,360
erickson in general have really helped

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,399
with the with the collaboration of

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,320
standards

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,000
alliances and open source as seen on

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,360
your on your slide

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,800
um the the question is really around

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,040
do you see any missing pieces in terms

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,440
of

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,040
other standards organization or other

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,560
alliances that we should be thinking

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,720
about as a community

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,720
when you look at verticals specifically

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,880
i think to further work uh i think one

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,079
one of the challenges

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,120
with the operator industry and or the

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,679
telco industry

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,400
is the compared to for example the

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,160
development

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,039
uh developer environment on hyperscalers

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,439
is the

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,240
federation or alignment of interfaces

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,000
there i see

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,520
a team forum and meth for example as

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,079
key areas to facilitate

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,079
that east-west and also facilitate the

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,600
multi-vendor

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,640
or integration around orchestration and

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,880
business management logic so

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,320
those are two areas where we are putting

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,480
a lot of effort into

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,480
very good all right very good angus

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,480
thank you very much for

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,720
for taking the time really appreciate

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,600
your your insights here

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,799
thank you very much all right and i

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,640
think there was another question that

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,039
was directed probably at me

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,760
from a linux foundation perspective

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,440
which was

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,600
you know one of the key objectives of lf

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,320
is to maintain an ecosystem of multiple

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,360
contributors in key markets uh

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,520
you know there's like three

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
manufacturers for radio you know how do

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,799
you see them

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
you know in each of the market you you

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,919
see

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,200
uh what what would happen if there's

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,039
only two or one

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,720
and i think i would probably be the

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,120
first one to say

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,160
that first of all you know it's not

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,600
three it's

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,480
more than five and more importantly

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,640
the disaggregation of the entire

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,000
architecture allows for a lot more

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,960
startups and innovators

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,039
to join and then change the thinking and

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,240
provide the pieces of the puzzle

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:39,679
in fact to so so much as

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,640
uh you know in which conference would

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,720
you have

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,160
uh you know back-to-back presentation

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
from what i would say

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
you know which traditionally the the

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,679
world would call

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,280
competitors but they are collaborators

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,320
in our open world

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,919
so with that said our next speaker

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,640
is from nokia and you know he is one of

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,240
the most

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,240
active executives in linux foundation

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,559
uh from an open source perspective you

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,080
know board strategy etc

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,760
uh he's the head of open source

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,370
initiatives at nokia

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:19,870
please welcome jonah sonneny

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,870
[Music]

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,120
hello so i'm um

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,440
i'm uh jonas vernon and i work for nokia

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
uh

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,960
as harvard says i'm the head of open

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,960
source initiatives here

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,080
and i will be talking to you a little

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,039
bit about

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,080
my approach and our approach to open

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,760
source

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,520
and the uh the edge

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,360
um and then the net open source

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,160
networking on the edge but first of all

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,280
i have to say

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
this is a great um event and it's been

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
really interesting to see the great

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,880
presentations

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,840
and i have to say i'm very humbled to be

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,120
part of this

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,360
um great lineup where where

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,280
there has been so many good speakers and

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,720
with so many interesting

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:15,200
areas now let's see if this works

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:18,240
it does great um so what does nokia do

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,799
um so what nokia does is it builds

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,039
networks

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,640
we do we are a network vendor we do

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,360
network infrastructure

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,080
we are one of the few vendors who have

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,440
um

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,080
who are basically in all of the spaces

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,799
of

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,960
of networking and what we like to say

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,120
that what we build is we build

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,520
critical networks and technologies to

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,159
bring together the world's intelligence

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,039
and what that means is that critical

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,280
networks are

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,720
the networks that are critical for this

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,640
world so it's not

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,320
just us special kind of networks but

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,200
these are the networks that are critical

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
for the world

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,039
so taking into account our service

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,679
providers

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,880
uh industry automation digitalization

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,480
and all this that

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,600
enables basically us to move on

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,720
uh as an uh digital

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,559
world and what is needed in the digital

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,440
uh in the digital transformation

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,720
the where we see is that this is an

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,840
intersection

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,880
of the carrier grade resellers and

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,000
performance and the web scale

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,039
elasticity and flexibility and that is

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,240
what we are

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,000
aiming at and as um we

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
has been mentioned already during this

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
week we work with the um

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,360
with the leading vendors uh like andrei

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,559
fuchs from atnt mentioned um that we're

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,720
working together

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,880
but we're also then working together to

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,679
pro provide our services on

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,400
on our uh solutions on top of web

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,559
scalers

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,480
so we are working like george from um

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,640
from a google mentioned a little bit

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,480
before yeah in this

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,360
in this forum as well what do we base

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,480
this on

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,280
so what we base this on

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,799
plan in technology evolution that we

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,799
think that matter that the

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,080
technology evolution that we think is

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,960
important

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,080
that first of all it's clear it's cloud

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,440
native software

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,320
and the transformation to cloud native

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,280
that is a key transition in our industry

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,320
today

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,400
um we're proud to be leading that

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,000
in our industry this is something that

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
we are we find

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,480
extremely important and this is

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,799
something that is important not only for

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,960
us

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,919
but also for our customers and for our

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,440
compatibility with other platforms

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,559
this cannot be done without openness

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:55,840
without having the best performance

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:58,159
uh and having the leading

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,960
basically having about having

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,600
technologies

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,240
and having um architectures that are

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
open

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,559
that provide the um best performance and

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,320
the lowest

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:13,679
dco for a multivendor environment

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,960
um there is no a possibility of

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,840
uh of a closed environment succeeding

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,600
anymore in this world and and therefore

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,720
the openness is a big part of

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,120
what we do it's not just about however

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,080
about

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,440
software it's also about silicon it's

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,080
also about

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,000
hardware and making sure that we have

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,520
the best silicon for our customers to

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
use

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,120
and this is of course when we look at

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,919
these things

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,279
many of these have aspects that we have

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,880
discussed in this

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,799
forum this week many of these aspects

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
uh have aspects that are relevant to

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,240
open source

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:58,320
um the however

00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,679
we are not anymore in normal times

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,919
um the world has changed last year

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,720
in the uh for uh when kovitz set in

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,159
and this has basically um been a

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,159
tremendous

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,240
strain and that depends challenge of

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,200
course for people individually

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,799
but also for our customers and for the

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,279
industry as a whole

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,520
what we have there um throughout the

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,200
pandemic we have focused on making sure

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,320
that our customers

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,120
um can live through and can provide

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,159
the best possible service during these

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,960
times

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
and the three phases that we have

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,200
basically

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,159
um focused on is secure

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,880
that we keep the networks up and running

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,120
scale

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,159
that we adapt to these demands and

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,200
stimulate

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,120
that we um continue to have all business

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,240
models and use cases

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,840
in this changing world it is actually

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,520
interesting to see that

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:03,360
what we saw we have um

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,960
we have published a report um in our

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,080
uh by our deep field uh department

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,159
and the about what is

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,480
what how did we see that the world

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,640
changed in the networks

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
when the kobit set in it is actually

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,039
quite interesting to see

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,520
that within the first weeks the growth

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,640
of

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,840
traffic was about the same so um

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,600
30 to 40 percent what you usually see in

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,039
one year

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,799
the good thing is that um

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,880
basically the networks that was what

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,039
they were meant to do

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,080
and the networks survived without any

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,120
glitches

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,400
and basically the um uh every

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,799
everything worked this is what we do

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
this is what we live for it's basically

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,000
making sure

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,000
that these critical networks work

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,120
regardless what happens

00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,159
and though this uh has been a very

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,720
difficult time for everybody of us

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,679
um and the testament of that is that

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,159
we're now

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,840
uh here uh remotely and we're not in the

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,679
same place everybody

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,600
um the basically the telecom networks

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,440
and the telecom paradigms are something

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,120
that do

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,679
um help us uh in uh do actually

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,120
allow us to live through this and allow

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,600
us to continue to work together

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,320
what i still do want to talk about a

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,440
little bit

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,159
is about openness what does that mean

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,720
for us

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,080
and what does that mean for the industry

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
in our mind

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,440
we like to look at when we look at

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,120
openness and

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,760
uh as basically a question of four

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,039
pillars

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,279
we have open forums open interface open

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,640
culture and open ecosystems

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:55,520
it is quite clear that the

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,240
uh open source is big part of this

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,679
openness

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,360
um but and i'm gonna talk a little bit

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,559
about that how that fits in in there a

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,840
little bit more

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,799
in just a minute but also the thing is

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,679
basically

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,520
um we need also other things of openness

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,919
for this to succeed

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,279
one of the key things that i would like

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,640
to emphasize

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:22,240
is the open culture you cannot be open

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,360
in terms of open source or in terms of

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,600
open standards

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,720
if you don't have an open culture inside

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,880
your company

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,360
to start with that brings together then

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,320
using the build building blocks that

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,240
open source

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,480
open standards and so on create um

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,600
opening interfaces and creating open

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,279
ecosystems

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
but the culture is where everything

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,200
starts from

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,640
and this is something that the company

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,919
needs to have

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,679
internally nurtured and it is basically

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,960
something that the company needs to

00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,080
uh um it needs to be built in

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:04,640
rather than being something to add on

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,640
um otherwise the um

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,000
otherwise we cannot move forward and we

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,360
cannot actually

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,480
provide the other pillars in this

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,919
popular system now if we

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,919
look at the um

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,799
if we look at then at the open forums

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,360
that is the area where we see open

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,080
source

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,360
but we also see open standards and open

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,799
architectures

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,799
um the basically standards

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,320
and open source is something that what

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,360
we see as

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,559
the sides are two sides of the same coin

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,360
standards are are something that is are

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,240
is needed to create interoperability and

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,480
to ensure

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,159
compatibility between different kind of

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,640
implementations

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,200
open source on the other hand fits the

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,520
best

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,960
into something where you one

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,360
implementation

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,399
provides so to say the standard for the

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,640
world

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,919
and of course there is interaction

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,640
between these

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,080
basically the um open source sometimes

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,200
implement standards

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,559
and standards some sometimes references

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,120
to open source

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,000
we see this and nowadays more and more

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,559
in the

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
activities that we we do that there is

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,960
an interaction

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,880
with between these um uh the two sides

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,760
of the same coin

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:31,200
um the thing is that often is

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,000
i have been asked previously um

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,320
so do these things compete and will open

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,880
source win over standardization

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,640
or will standardization be something

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,000
that is actually more important and this

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,679
opens were something that

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,320
um will fade away over time um

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,279
we have had standardization for a very

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,919
long time

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,320
those will not go away that is for sure

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,720
the

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,679
they are still needed and they bring a

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,440
basis

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,880
for everything where there needs to be

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,200
compatibility with

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,039
uh between different kinds of

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,679
implementations

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,960
that is augmented by open source

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,039
nowadays in

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,480
um in the industry and there are

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,080
basically places

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,200
where open source is more direct tool

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,320
and more um

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,880
more adapt tool to actually

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,320
bring the bringing the benefits and we

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,799
can see this especially

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,919
in the areas where uh there's little

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,480
differentiation

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,159
between the players who are actually

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,120
doing the open source together

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,720
that they have an interest to cooperate

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,399
and they have an interest to come to a

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,760
common solution

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:45,600
standards on the other hand allow also

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,960
more space for proprietary competition

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,600
as well

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,000
but when we look at then open source

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,440
what are the areas where we are

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,360
as nokia interested and where we are

00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:05,840
participating in is basically

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,840
the um are the

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,320
when we look at the linux foundation

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,600
space

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,200
um it is i mean like you've seen these

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,320
logos most probably

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,200
um and most definitely throughout the

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,240
uh the presentations here so if we look

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,840
at the

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,279
um if we look at the open source

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,120
projects that are important

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,399
for us in the lf space and in the linux

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,240
foundation space

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:40,159
it's clearly uh oren software community

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,519
all of networking lfai and lf edge

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,760
and we're part of those of course

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,200
something that is not on this slide is

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,320
that what a lot

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,360
is now built on which is cncf

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,559
and the cloud native movement the

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,039
um these are areas where we are very

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,240
much

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,960
involved where we have um

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,480
where we are having um board positions

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,279
where we have intact positions

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,760
where we are having also where we are

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,600
active

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,279
in the um in the projects

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,200
and if we look at the kind of like

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,320
couple of projects that are important

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,679
for us

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,200
in those spaces yes for instance in oren

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,559
software community

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,679
we are act we are driving the um

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:30,720
near real-time rick implementation um

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,640
in lf networking what we're we're

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,559
working especially in onap

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,760
and anucat and so on and so on there are

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,240
um and in addition to this there are of

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,440
course

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,880
other open source uh organizations where

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:50,720
an open source projects big and small

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,600
that uh where we are participating in

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,080
uh it's clear that open source basically

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,640
uh

00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,720
defines big part of that what

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
telecommunication networking is today

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:08,080
now looking at the call for action uh

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,720
the thing is um and i think this was

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,760
mentioned by somebody already before

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,320
it's important to work together um

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,360
this is about open source this is about

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,720
community

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,399
we have different communities um

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,679
that are but the thing important thing

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,080
is to bring

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,200
a big open source community where we

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,399
work together

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,919
there is little room for competing

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,159
um competing technologies

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,360
it is better to make sure that we work

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,760
together rather than

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,279
trying to create new ones on top of the

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,679
old ones

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,880
so this is very important and it's this

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,080
means also

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,960
that we have to work in the communities

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,600
that are actually responsible for those

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,960
uh

00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,320
technologies and we have to have those

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,600
at least as upstream uh from um

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,960
projects that are uh that where there is

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,760
a relationship needed

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,760
and where there is where the community

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,040
that owns the technology

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,599
is the place where we come to together

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,480
even if we are discussing the technology

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,879
somewhere else as well

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,320
the other thing is that for open source

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,280
it's quite important

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,839
that we actually focus on the value what

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,560
is

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,520
where is that open source brings extra

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,240
value

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,200
um where that we work together that

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,320
where we

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,560
it is not a point solution from one

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,440
uh company but it's actually something

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,240
where we have

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,440
uh contributed together and we have

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,440
compatibility

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,320
um and uh reusability over the

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,960
industry is important and that is i

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,839
think that

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,399
it's clear that we should that's where

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,599
open source is at its best

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,240
doing open source just to copy um

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,760
activities or copy basically something

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,000
that is already there

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,599
that doesn't bring as much value as

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,040
bringing building something new

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,160
and building something that where the

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,720
community really has power

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,640
the least but not the last one the last

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,280
one but not the least one sorry that way

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,640
around

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,680
um yes of course then we should take

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,960
security more

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,240
uh seriously the world has

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,680
changed um security is something that

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,880
is now paramount uh for our customers

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,960
for uh and um and the

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,800
kind of like the threats are have

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,839
actually evolved as well

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,560
so in that sense i think that we what we

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,480
need

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,680
is to focus more on security that we

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,760
have done before

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,359
and this is a quite an important step

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,400
that we need to do

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:56,640
um in to make sure that

00:35:52,400 --> 00:36:00,320
open source um is considered

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,920
trustworthy also in the future

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:07,119
now that was what i considered to

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,720
tell you i um i'm very thankful

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,119
and very honored to be part of this

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,560
lineup i hope you found this at least

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,760
somewhat useful

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,280
um if you have any questions um

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,240
i think that there might be some time

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,200
now but then the question is also that

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,520
you can

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,440
contact me i'm sure that you can find me

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,040
on linkedin and so on

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,280
and ask any questions on that

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,280
um

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,160
oh that was that was great uh thank you

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,880
yona

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,400
and uh really appreciate your your

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,960
insights here

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,760
um so let me introduce uh the next

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,960
speaker

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,480
um uh he's from facebook obviously but

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,119
uh brian barrett who's been a a thought

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,880
leader

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,079
in uh a project called magma which just

00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,560
recently moved to the linux foundation

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,200
and we are really excited to have brian

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,320
uh

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,160
talk about the ecosystem and

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,720
how magma is a critical piece of an

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,760
end-to-end 5g stack for the telecom

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:20,720
mobile core so please welcome brian

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:23,040
[Music]

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,160
great thank you arpit hi everyone my

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,599
name is brian barrett i'm

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,720
an engineering manager at facebook

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,839
connectivity so at facebook connectivity

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,240
um our our mission is to bring the world

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,920
online to a better and faster internet

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,640
so let's start there with a bit of an

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,960
overview of how we're doing so far

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,160
the state of global connectivity uh

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,200
there's some good news

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,800
uh global access is improving according

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,599
to the international telecommunications

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,880
union's

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,040
internet bandwidth index in 2020 total

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,320
connectivity of the average household is

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,839
increasing worldwide by about 45 and 4g

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,000
connections are increasing

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,680
so we now have 65 percent of lower and

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,400
middle-income countries

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,160
have 4g coverage but there are some

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,079
problems still

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,560
one of them is that network performance

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,079
is at risk 3.3 billion people in

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,280
developing and emerging markets are at

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,920
risk of a degraded

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,200
network performance by 2023 and facebook

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,200
cares about connectivity

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,119
because it's good for the world and good

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,880
for facebook bringing connect

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,720
being connected opens up new

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,119
opportunities to make yourself heard

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,400
to connect with people and communities

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,760
you care about and to build new

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,200
businesses

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,720
so at facebook connectivity one of the

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,560
things we do is we look across the

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,480
entire connectivity ecosystem

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,839
and the value chain try to understand

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,640
the reasons

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,119
why people have sub-optimal connectivity

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,599
and what we could do to improve it

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,119
one of the things we noticed is that in

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,880
many markets

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,040
you have enough population density to

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,400
really warrant a cellular network

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,720
existing

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,240
but they don't exist in a lot of markets

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,480
or the ones that do exist

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,920
aren't affordable by the average people

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,240
because in markets where the average

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,320
revenue per user is very low

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,520
often the existing telecom models of the

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,280
network core

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,560
with the subscription models for

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,680
licensing and the equipment

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,880
costs are just too high to make it

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,839
affordable for a company to

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,400
provide cellular coverage in that area

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,000
and so

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,839
one of the things that we set out to do

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,040
at facebook connectivity

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,079
is to enable the open source telco

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,560
to catalyze an open source 5g movement

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,920
and to dramatically reduce the total

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,960
cost of ownership

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,960
of cellular networks

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,720
so we developed magma magma was open

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,960
source

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,839
last year and it just recently launched

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,040
in february as a new linux foundation

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,560
based project so magma is

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,599
different than other network cores it's

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,520
hyper scalable and also distributed and

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,520
so by distributed

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,960
i think it's fairly common now to see

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,359
network cores where people

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,240
containerize their epc and able to run

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,160
it on

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,800
on a rack of servers at a point of

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,640
presence or run it in the cloud

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,960
magma goes a step further you can run

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,359
magma like that if you want to

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,720
but magma is also designed to run

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,079
without a rack of servers

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,599
anywhere you can run magma on very

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,119
low end far edge appliances

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,920
at the far edge of the network so

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,800
imagine a small

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,160
ruggedized x86 server for a couple

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,880
hundred dollars

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,359
deploying one at each of your cell sites

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,240
letting

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,040
them break out to ip right at the far

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,079
edge

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,359
and having them all connect back uh

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:49,599
to a control plane in the cloud or

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:52,960
on-prem on an on-prem cloud

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,240
it's open source and completely license

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,359
free so this is licensed

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,040
uh with uh bsd three clause licensed

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,880
completely open source software

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,160
free for others to use freezed up free

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,119
for others to white label and sell

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,760
it's cloud native both for central cloud

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,880
and

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,680
we have work for even edge cloud native

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,160
with control plane user plane separation

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,240
it's vendor and transport agnostic

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,640
and it's also designed shown in this

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,440
diagram here with an optional component

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,119
where if you want to use magma in a

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,960
lower cost market

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,640
but still connect to a legacy core used

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,640
on a larger network

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,160
you can federate with that larger core

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,599
and inherent from the

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,240
hss and pcrf policies from an existing

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,200
core

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,240
and just use magma in lower cost regions

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,599
where it might be admin pages for you

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,160
and it's designed for all access

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,319
conversions so it's not just 4g

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:55,760
it's 4g 5g private lte and wi-fi

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,760
all in this open source solution

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,680
so at facebook we see the evolution of

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,640
open source and telco

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,240
following a similar model as enterprise

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,640
so 15 years ago

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,400
open source and enterprise started with

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,800
you know red hat shipping

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,800
linux on cds and retail stores and

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,960
hobbyists experimenting with linux

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,240
in niche use cases you saw linux users

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,680
groups

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,359
enterprise started adopting it and

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,760
eventually it gained broad adoption in

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,359
the enterprise

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,400
telco is where telco open source

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,319
we see following the similar steps right

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,400
now you see niche deployments

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,520
by cable satellite operators and

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,160
developing countries

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,680
places with low arku and we see that

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,119
growing in the same way

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,560
where there's select mmos they're

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,760
starting to pay attention and follow in

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,800
the footsteps of

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,560
geo racket and dish looking at bringing

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,760
more of these open solutions and open

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,040
source implementations into their

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,800
networks

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,400
before we think it will then eventually

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,359
gain as broad of adoption as open source

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,720
has an enterprise now

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,720
and we think it'll be different between

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,400
core and ran

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,800
we think openran will follow the journey

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,359
of open compute

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,880
where there will be many implementations

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,160
and we think open core will follow the

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,280
journey of kubernetes

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,880
or openstack where there will be

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,599
many attempts to make an open source

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,520
telco stack but there will be one

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,839
emergent de facto implementation that

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,839
will become the standard

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,119
and we hope that magma is the basis of

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,880
that standard so in 2021 we established

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,800
the magma core foundation

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,319
magma has been open source licensed

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,760
since 2020

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,520
but we've started hearing a lot of

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,359
interest from large organizations that

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,040
would like to contribute

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,560
meaningful teams of software engineers

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,920
to the project and a lot of mature

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,000
organizations

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,599
like to know there's a very familiar and

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,040
trusted governance model

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,480
for the project so in 2021 magma core

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,839
foundation was established under the

00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,520
linux foundation

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,960
so that we'd now operate under linux

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,440
foundation governance

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,200
completely neutral so facebook continues

00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,280
to contribute a large team of software

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,359
engineers to help anchor the ecosystem

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,119
but the ecosystem's really flourishing

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,560
we founded magma foundation with a

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,160
number of large partners

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,599
we have participants from across the

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,319
industry participating in magma

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,520
foundation

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,000
either as founding members on the

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,000
governing board or or just participants

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,119
in the open source movement

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,839
and we also have ecosystem partnerships

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,520
with open infrastructure foundation open

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,599
air interface alliance

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,880
and the telecom info project are all

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,160
part of magma

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,920
and we think because of this it's really

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,480
emerging as the de facto open source

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,480
network core

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,560
so it's our belief that it will be the

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,079
one open core implementation

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,640
that is open source converged

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,760
cloud native and multi-tenant by design

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,760
from the ground up

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,880
so here's how we're doing we're really

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,240
seeing strong

00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,520
a strong community growth in magma so

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,640
this graph shows our growth in advocates

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,640
which are people that are working on

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,280
magma all the time contributors

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,480
people that contribute to the code base

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,520
and participants

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,680
which is people that use magma and

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,359
converse in our slack channels and ask

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,560
questions and engage and comment on

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,319
design

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,800
and that's really grown radically lately

00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,359
uh in july of last year we announced

00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,079
uh publicly that we had a a partnership

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,560
with open

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,599
air interface telecom infra project and

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,280
open infrastructure

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,000
foundation and in in february we

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,680
announced the linux

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,839
foundation announcement and you can see

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,960
the large growth in the magma community

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,560
over that time if you add

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,400
to that observer so these are people who

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,960
have starred our repos or downloaded

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,200
magma

00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,359
or experimenting with it and using it

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,960
it's even larger

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,560
we have now over a thousand people

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,560
participating in the magma ecosystem

00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,720
so one of the things we're really trying

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,200
to build a healthy robust

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,880
self-sustaining ecosystem around magma

00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,040
we do that in a few ways

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,960
one is that we partner with industry

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,720
groups that are interested in

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,599
helping scale with the number of

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,319
developers driving developer adoption

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,640
we partner with vendors and operators to

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,480
help drive adoption of magma

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,400
including people that want to

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,760
participate in trials

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,880
and deploy 5g or 4g networks in new

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,119
areas

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,640
learn how to use magma we partner with

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,839
academia because one of the things we're

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,760
observing is that

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,480
communities that want to experiment with

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,319
the latest 5g release 16 or at least 17

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,839
features

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,599
open source is the place those things

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,839
appear first because if you're if you're

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,440
a scientist or a researcher you want to

00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,560
experiment with bleeding edge features

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,000
in the core of the ram

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,440
the easiest place for you to do that is

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,440
to start with open source and add the

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,280
code you need for your new feature

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,720
when we partner with startups there's a

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,599
lot of people that are now building

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,560
distros

00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,720
on magma our partners at freedom fire

00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,520
one example

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,240
and so through these engagements we help

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,880
drive

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,160
adoption of magma future use case

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,400
experimentation

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,920
and innovation in the ecosystem

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,680
so i wanted to share a couple really

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,000
exciting things that

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,119
partners startups and ecosystem members

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,880
are doing with magma

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,640
these are just two of many highlights

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,599
from our developers summit in

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,720
uh in february uh one of them is our

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,599
partnership with

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,000
amazon so one of the things that amazon

00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,599
did

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,440
is leveraged magma's distributed

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,400
architecture to make it

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,520
one click deployable on their far edge

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,280
appliances

00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,880
so everyone's probably familiar with

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,960
amazon's central regions

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,200
and maybe even amazon outposts where you

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,760
can put a rack of servers on-prem

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,920
for amazon cloud but they also have the

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,599
snowball and snow cone

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,520
far edge appliances that are shown here

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,839
on the picture left

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,280
and so working together we actually

00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,720
demonstrated at the developers

00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,000
conference the ability to one click

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,000
deploy magma

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,760
where the magma control plane deploys to

00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,880
an aws region

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,800
and the magma user plane gets deployed

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,079
on a number of snow cone appliances that

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,240
are just about this big

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,680
that have e-ink shipping labels and you

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,119
can ship them out

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,559
anywhere in the world and plug them in

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,200
and they zero touch provision connect

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,800
back into the central cloud

00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,200
another really exciting use case our

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,839
partners have done with magma

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,880
is is found with a partnership between

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,520
freedom fi

00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,720
and helium which is a crypto blockchain

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,800
uh

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,920
organization so unlike normal

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,240
cryptocurrencies

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,440
where you burn electricity to mine

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,800
bitcoins

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,559
with helium you mine helium coins by

00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,359
connecting the unconnected

00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,480
so uh helium has operated previously

00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,319
with lorawan

00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,160
where you connect lorawan hotspots at

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,040
your house and they all join together to

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,599
make one

00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,960
large iot network but with a partnership

00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,960
with freedom five they're bringing that

00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,160
use case to 4g and 5g

00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,359
so that you connect a magma based

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,520
appliance connect a 4g or 5g radio

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,119
it calls in and gets cbrs spectrum from

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,440
a spectrum allocation service

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,760
makes a small 5g hotspot and they all

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,880
join together to make one larger network

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,040
and mine helium cryptocoins uh by for

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,599
providing coverage and allowing users

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,680
to obtain internet access through that

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,280
hotspot so it's a real people's network

00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,640
for connecting the unconnected which is

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,599
a really interesting and exciting use

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,599
case behind magma

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,800
so we'd like to invite everyone on this

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,599
call to join us and build your

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,440
connectivity

00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,520
software as a service enterprise or

00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,839
consumer business faster with magma

00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,079
and help ride this 5g wave with us

00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:41,680
there's a few ways you can get involved

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,119
if you're an industry group we'd

00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,880
like to work with you to bring your

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,960
developer scale

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,000
and evangelize magma to your users in

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,079
your community

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,520
and to help support and drive adoption

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,040
in magma use cases

00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,440
in your community if you're a vendor

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,440
or a systems integrator magma is really

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,520
designed to be brought to market

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,280
through systems integrators and

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,640
value-added resellers that want to build

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,720
their own distros

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,240
so we invite you to partner with us and

00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,839
create development teams

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,520
to focus on magma development

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,760
development and integrated is a key part

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,800
of your open source strategy

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,400
to help you build with magma and use it

00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,319
as a production grade commercial

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,760
ready lego block for you to build a

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,400
larger solution that you want to take to

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,000
market

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,599
and lean on the magma community to help

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,960
leak fraud

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,880
in a post coded world if you're an

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,319
operator or a service provider

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,680
we think magma is pretty compelling

00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,520
because it lets you take control of your

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,680
5g vision and destiny

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,880
and say goodbye to vendor lock-in help

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,160
you get full visibility in your

00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,839
production networks

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,760
right from the code level including

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,720
shift left for devsecops and security

00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,000
vulnerabilities

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,920
because you can see them right in the

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,680
source space and patch them very quickly

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,680
and if you're a startup or investor you

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,440
can leverage magma stack to build faster

00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,280
and accelerate your product development

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,880
and time to market you can lean on our

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,079
expert community to leapfrog your

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,359
competition

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,359
and explore adjacencies

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,800
and lastly if you're in academia or in

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,319
the public domain

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,920
you can leverage the magma stack for

00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:12,480
your academic research in r d

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,240
projects unlock future use cases and

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,119
collaborate for advancing open source

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,000
telco

00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,880
and 5g to next gene movements so we have

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,160
some

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,880
really exciting opportunities we're

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,319
already seeing with 5g release 16 and 17

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,359
features with integrative access and

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,680
backhaul

00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,480
and non-terrestrial network connectivity

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,040
with public

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,440
sector opportunities from darpa and the

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,720
european space agency and the usdod

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,920

thank you very much arthur it's great to

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,319
be here it's a pleasure to

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,200
present at this event i'm here to talk

00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,319
about our

00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,319
software approaches in

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,640
uh infrastructure that we're running in

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,640
linkedin about linkedin what is linkedin

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,800
linkedin is an online platform

00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,559
that connects sports professional i've

00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,880
been at linkedin during

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,680
a time of incredible growth our growth

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,280
in member

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,839
engagement has generated uh enormous

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,079
need for

00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,800
data storage for infrastructure and

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,880
operation at scale that forced us to

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,960
change the way that the architect can

00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,760
operate our network

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,160
currently we have nearly 740 members in

00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,680
200 countries with more than

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,800
57 million companies have a page on

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,359
linkedin

00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,000
covet has increased our member

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,400
engagement

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,720
on to a new scale during the covet last

00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,720
year from march to december

00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,520
we saw six times increase in number of

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,440
remote job hosting in united states

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,599
to demonstrate the scale and importance

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,160
of our infrastructure we ser

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,760
we serve close to 40 trillion kafka

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,960
messages per day

00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,760
and our economic graph has grown to 200

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,880
billion

00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,040
ravages this demand from

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,079
our linkedin platform requires us

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,440
constantly grow

00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:02,720
our infrastructure and scale our data

00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:06,720
center back on an edge network to serve

00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,359
our platform in terms of vision our

00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,040
vision for

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,040
network and infrastructure engineering

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,240
is to use the best methods and practices

00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,280
to provide

00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:18,000
reliable infrastructure to linkedin

00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,440
we believe that infrastructure network

00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,040
in general is there to

00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,480
enable our business and application

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,079
and the network is definitely so

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,520
important but its importance is

00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,839
enabling business and application

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,240
capabilities and the more that

00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,359
it becomes transferring it more the more

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,040
value it can bring

00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,720
for us to keep up with the scale demands

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,839
capacity requirements

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,480
and operations first mindset

00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:44,640
we put our focus on programmability of

00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,760
our infrastructure to deploy

00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,559
new pods seamlessly and data center

00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,720
provides self-healing capabilities

00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,760
reduce operational torque to scale our

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,720
application out

00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,359
closer to to our members and improve the

00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,359
preference

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,319
we started our journey to disaggregation

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,440
in 2015

00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:12,480
and our intent was to

00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,480
speed up in innovation velocity bring

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,520
the features that we needed most

00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:21,760
faster into production

00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:24,960
and by owning those features control our

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,440
network architecture and destiny

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,200
as our network group we realized that we

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,880
should pivot our focus

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,839
and our investment on the software and

00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,040
ideally a uniform code

00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,960
across different hardwares that we

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,480
operate in our network

00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,400
open switch project under linux

00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,160
foundation was very important to us

00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,000
running linux on switches and routers

00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,960
enabled us to

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,119
to use the same tool set that we use on

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,280
our servers and our compute

00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,520
and extend the same philosophy to our

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,240
network devices

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,160
now with sonic over a dozen different

00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,880
skus including

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,200
a variety of different oem odm and open

00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,640
19 platforms are supported

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,920
in a uniform fashion that we can run uh

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,760
same sonic software

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,760
across multiple different hardwares with

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,920
different chipsets

00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,400
by using switch abstraction interface or

00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,960
psi we utilize the latest silicon from

00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,680
12.8 to 25 terabit

00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,799
and it enables us to uplift our data

00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,079
center from 100

00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:29,839
to 400 gig across the board

00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,119
in order to scale our routing and

00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:33,760
control plane we

00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,440
onboarded free-range routing to sonic

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,640
community or fr

00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,000
under linux foundation that enabled us

00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,400
to scale our

00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,720
egp networking data center and improve

00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,559
ecmp properties to have

00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,720
better control over routing convergence

00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,960
and management of how routes get

00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:56,079
propagated across the network

00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,920
we also designed our own

00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,240
data center routing protocol based on

00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,440
linked state properties to improve

00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:07,040
better utilization of forwarding paths

00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:09,599
in a widely connected parallel fabric

00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,000
which is open source and is available on

00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:15,760
free range routing as fabric d

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,480
as we call it in linkedin open fabric

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,280
moving on to control and management

00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,760
plane i believe

00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,720
one easy step toward programmability is

00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,520
to move network

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,000
to linux we have linux as the default

00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,200
experience

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,720
from of course compute but top of racks

00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,440
which is to spine and leave

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,520
along with their management network this

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,880
enabled us to design our network just

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,880
like a distributed system

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,880
as opposed to conventional bugs by box

00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,760
operation

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,880
the next step for us was instead of

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,640
using different management protocols

00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,920
that were difficult to customize such as

00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,200
snmp

00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,040
syslog as flow we came up with a

00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,559
standard way of pulling and pushing data

00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,520
out of the network elements using the

00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,319
pops up

00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,319
pipeline in a distributed manner we

00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,520
developed netcm which is our

00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,520
common platform for network

00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,960
configuration management based on

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,559
open config and yank models and its job

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,119
is not only to perform

00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,280
provisioning and configuration tasks but

00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,920
also

00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,440
compare configs and notify us about

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,359
configuration drifts

00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,520
among thousands of network elements that

00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:25,760
we operate in our data centers

00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,960
telemetry data is sent from each element

00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:31,440
to distributed setup

00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:34,400
process as a collector's process and

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,720
those collectors can convert patterns

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,960
and

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,240
make meaningful and context out of that

00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,359
data that we can

00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,760
feed into time series database count the

00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:46,960
frequencies of individual or related

00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:50,000
events or perform data science

00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:53,440
to improve our data aggregation

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,359
and also our self-healing properties

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,680
that are going to talk about

00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,839
the the other aspect of managing network

00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,200
as a distributed system is that if you

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:05,359
store network state at a point of time

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,599
then you can perform data analytics by

00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:10,640
going back to previously stored state

00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:12,960
for root cause analysis or restore the

00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:16,960
last language state when needed

00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:20,880
it opens up many possibilities and make

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:23,280
things quite interesting for example you

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,880
you can replay how your routing system

00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,240
react and

00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,559
follow update propagation

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,640
across the distributed system figure out

00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,640
inconsistencies and perhaps

00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,799
black holes or micro loops or longer

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,440
convergence time and by

00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:41,359
understanding that data you can you can

00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,000
use it as feedback loop to reiterate and

00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,200
improve

00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,200
upon those finding and make your

00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:49,760
infrastructure better

00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,640
moving on to for running plane we we

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,799
talked about

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,160
uh properties of control panel

00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,480
management plane and this is something

00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,720
that

00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,559
comes along with control plane but it's

00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:02,079
mostly focused on forwarding plane

01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,599
i want to talk about the project that we

01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,680
spent

01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,200
past couple of years and we're happy to

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,880
announce that we're working with linux

01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,920
foundation to open source it

01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,400
to the community i believe the

01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,680
philosophy of network monitoring or

01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,960
fundamental value is to to quickly

01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,400
identify if network

01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,240
is the root cause of a problem

01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,000
whenever gcn happens regardless of

01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,200
symptoms

01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,119
network is legitimate suspect and

01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,880
if it's not a network issue then we

01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,440
should be able to

01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,640
rule ourselves out as quickly as

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,720
possible

01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:42,880
and data is the ultimate authority

01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,720
for us argos provides that data to know

01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,599
if there's a fault

01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,280
in the network and where it is argus is

01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:52,960
our forwarding play

01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:56,160
telemetry fault detection and fault

01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,520
isolation system a large scale data

01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,400
center

01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,640
there are many components links optics

01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,440
network elements can

01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,200
go down mean time between failure is

01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,040
directly proportional to the number of

01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,920
components in a system

01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,760
argos creates a a network between

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,680
participating and hosts

01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,200
probing each other and connected through

01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,200
kafka pipeline

01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,040
it measures performance of every single

01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,200
connection in a network from host to

01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,839
host perspective and creates

01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,760
a matrix that consists of sla such as

01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:30,880
latency loss

01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,119
junior for different connections

01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,720
argos helped us in not only detecting

01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,440
network issues but also

01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,760
pointing out what node or link across

01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,559
the network

01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,240
have that problem it also provides an

01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,599
input to our self-helping system to

01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,440
steer traffic away

01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,200
from the fault change the ecmp grouping

01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:55,280
for better hashing and provide the best

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,280
delivery to our application

01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,039
so open fabric is the evolution of how

01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,440
we architect and operate our

01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,559
infrastructure as meeting

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,480
moved us from box by box to a completely

01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,280
distributed system based on open source

01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,440
that

01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,000
was realized by shifting our investment

01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,880
to to software and code

01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,200
the intent is not solving all of the

01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,160
problems by centralizing or distributing

01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,400
them but

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,599
to have a programmable network stack

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,319
that can

01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,839
enable seamless service provisioning

01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:29,440
skill and demand

01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,720
and self-healing capabilities to make

01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,839
network as transparent as possible

01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:39,359
and to enable business to serve

01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:42,480
our members as for call

01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:44,799
for action the value of

01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,440
any open source project is in the

01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:49,280
community and participation behind it

01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,720
at linkedin our engineering team has

01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,960
open source close to

01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,359
100 projects spanning different

01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,000
categories including data framework

01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:59,760
system operation testing we believe that

01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,200
open sourcing project makes our

01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:05,200
engineers better at what they do

01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,960
they grow in their craft by having their

01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:10,000
work shared with the community

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:13,440
and reviewed this project gained

01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,920
broad adoption that are now part of

01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,799
apache software foundation and the linux

01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,799
foundation as well

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,160
there are many tools that internal web

01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,760
scale companies use internally

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,160
that can bring tremendous value to the

01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,520
industry and i would like to invite

01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,920
everyone to join us in our answers

01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,920
thank you

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:43,920
all right thank you uh thanks a lot sean

01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,640
and i would like to sort of first of all

01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,760
say

01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:49,599
you know it has been such a change

01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,440
uh and and for those of you who would

01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,200
like to ask questions again i think i

01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,039
missed the opportunity you say that in

01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,520
the in the previous session

01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,799
with brian and iona but uh you know

01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:02,559
please do a q a

01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:03,680
on the top right but we really welcome

01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,520
you know what a change

01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,200
from you know say five years ago when it

01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,839
was a propriety telecom

01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,960
type industry now we have the cloud we

01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,079
have the enterprise

01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,799
end users and you know leaders like

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,039
yourself

01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:19,440
and facebook and others right like from

01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:22,160
a web 2.0 or a web scale company

01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,280
and and the thing that we really like or

01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,160
the community likes

01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,760
is the fact that these tools that that

01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,119
you have deployed and use and that

01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,880
you're contributing back to the

01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:33,280
community through open source

01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,240
they're at scale they have been proven

01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,720
and

01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,599
you just can we can all utilize the

01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,400
benefit

01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,119
uh and and make the networks much better

01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,880
so

01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,280
uh there's a couple of other other

01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,160
questions that that have also come in if

01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,280
you have a

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,000
you know i think we have a couple of

01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,280
minutes yep sure um you know how do you

01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,480
see

01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,480
uh the the uh enterprise data centers

01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,799
the massively scalable data centers like

01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,359
the you know azures of the world etc

01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:02,559
uh which have very custom workloads but

01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:05,440
they are very simple

01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,480
uh in nature uh versus sort of the you

01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,319
know linkedin

01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,000
which also have you know one or two five

01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:12,720
unique workloads versus

01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,160
uh you know a telco data center or an

01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,760
edge data like how do you see the

01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,440
evolution of these

01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:22,799
uh workloads uh getting uh spun up

01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:26,480
between different types of data centers

01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:27,200
yeah excellent question uh enterprise

01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,599
networks

01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,960
are back back in the day they were

01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,520
designed around this

01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,359
uh three hierarchical system of access

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,640
distribution and core and we used to see

01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,880
the same set of switches

01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,839
being used the intelligence was in the

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,280
core and

01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:45,839
access was purely connecting uh

01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,880
nodes together the shift that we're

01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,760
seeing

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,359
now as opposed to bring the traffic

01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,359
through the network to the core and then

01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,280
process it there or send it to

01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,559
service modules like load balancing and

01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:00,319
firewall

01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:02,400
um at scale people are trying to make

01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,079
network as simple as possible just you

01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,200
know provide massive bandwidth between

01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,480
nodes

01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,200
we see service finish we see distributed

01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,680
way of

01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,960
deploying application so network becomes

01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,799
just a bunch of boxes that

01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,119
provide massive bandwidth and then

01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:19,839
services can be

01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,960
easily move to the edge to be processed

01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,359
by

01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,079
uh for load balancing for viable and

01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,079
different reasons

01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,160
i can see that the enterprise is

01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,559
following the footsteps of

01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,200
large scale in terms of simplifying the

01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,640
core

01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,559
and then bring the intelligence to the

01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,359
edge

01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,559
gotcha very nice well thank you for your

01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,319
leadership and thank you for

01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,440
contributing back and i really

01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:46,000
appreciate

01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:49,119
your your insights here sean thank you

01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,119
pleasure to be here thank you

01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,319
all right um so with that i think we

01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:57,280
have uh

01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:58,960
uh we're saving obviously a very

01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:02,400
important member

01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,039
of of the global ecosystem and and some

01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,960
of

01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,640
you know some of you may most of you may

01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,760
know him for his vision vision and

01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,480
leadership but

01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,240
everybody knows deutsche telekom and you

01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,760
know their global footprint and

01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,039
you know if you see the onif and the

01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,720
types of speakers you know we are

01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,440
basically

01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,880
representing you know almost 70 percent

01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,359
of the global

01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,760
subscribers as covered by these carriers

01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:28,079
right now dt being one of the top ones

01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,680
so without any further delay please

01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,880
welcome you know arash

01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,960
uh ashoria svp

01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:43,839
uh group technology innovation at

01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:43,839
deutsche telekom raj

01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,559
yes good morning good afternoon good

01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,079
evening wherever you are

01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,960
um and thanks for having me what i like

01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:56,880
to do today

01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:59,039
is to um

01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,640
after all these great talks uh from

01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,960
different industry leaders

01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,160
put a bit of an operator ahead and look

01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,160
uh look at this

01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,160
whole development from an operator view

01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:14,960
and from an operator view obviously

01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:19,040
um if you look at different aspects

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:21,120
we have challenges on one side

01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,480
because um there's a level of

01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,960
competition with the

01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,640
hyperscalers on one side and cooperation

01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,159
on the other side

01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:32,400
there is um there's a lot of change in

01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:34,400
customer needs and behavior

01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,759
we started to see that with the launch

01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,080
of 5g

01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,600
and particularly with the pandemic and

01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,199
the way

01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,279
the pandemic forced a hybrid way of

01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:48,400
working

01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:52,080
top-notch connectivity anytime anywhere

01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:54,560
is bringing new requirements

01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,040
then you have obviously from an

01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,279
operator's perspective

01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,359
it's very difficult to innovate so you

01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,560
always need to be very focused about

01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,520
you know where you're going to put your

01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:08,159
bets on and

01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,159
we have um as deutsche telekom you know

01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:11,839
we always have this ambition

01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:15,120
not only to be the leading european

01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:18,319
telco but in the innovation in our dna

01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:20,319
and we have uh set up a very clear

01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,960
strategy

01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:23,759
for infrastructure which is basically

01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,359
transform that

01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:30,400
infrastructure to new open distributed

01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,520
cloud-based and eventually cloud-native

01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,319
architecture

01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,239
with simpler more intelligent and

01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:40,400
automated production model

01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:43,279
end-to-end and obviously the three

01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,239
ingredients to do that is desegregation

01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:47,440
both in

01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,000
mobile and fix i will cover that it will

01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,239
be

01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,120
the use the notion of cloud and cloud

01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:54,400
nativeness

01:09:51,120 --> 01:10:02,080
orchestration and most importantly

01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:06,320
in order to monetize the asset open apis

01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:08,159
um this um we have been sharing the left

01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,800
part of this picture with all of our

01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,840
partners

01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,840
around the globe which is um

01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,679
the this is the foundation from the

01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,400
network differentiation program which we

01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,560
have

01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,560
and it boils down to the three things i

01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,760
mentioned disaggregation

01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,640
um orchestration verification and open

01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,040
apis

01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:32,080
now um if you look in this aggregation

01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:35,199
it's public that for us open run

01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:37,360
as a founding member of x-ran which then

01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:40,400
turn into open run we

01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:43,760
clearly believe in in an

01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,840
open and open ecosystem and we are

01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:49,199
heavily driving that

01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:52,080
as uh within all the communities from

01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,480
from all around the lines itself to tip

01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,040
to

01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,000
linux foundation to onap and to many

01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,800
others on f

01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,760
to drive that open ecosystem and we

01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,400
believe this is not something

01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,960
um individual operators should drive on

01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,080
their own

01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,360
we need to create scale and we need to

01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,719
create speed

01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,800
of demand and therefore we have

01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,400
uh lined up with all the leading

01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,520
european telcos

01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:23,280
and have published an mou on

01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,400
oran in order to to foster

01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,360
innovation and to drive the ecosystem

01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,640
development

01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:34,000
with high speed we also have

01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:37,199
set up an um uh open tech lab

01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,960
in berlin which is not a telecom

01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,360
exclusive in fact it's together with

01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,320
telefonica and vodafone our competitors

01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,760
in europe

01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:48,800
and all our major suppliers were open

01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,000
uh like nokia who are open uh marvin

01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,800
here because

01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,800
samsung were open to work with us in

01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,600
that space

01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,880
and the idea there is to jointly drive

01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,239
open standard

01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,679
leverage collaboration and create an

01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:07,199
environment where you can

01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,199
have different telcos

01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:11,440
working and uh collaborating with the

01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:15,120
suppliers

01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:15,840
on the fixed side we have been pioneers

01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,199
on

01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,159
what we call xs4.0 which we did on the

01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:23,679
onf

01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:26,880
to drive this aggregation on fixed

01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:30,800
basically on or olt level

01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:33,040
and bng we have tried in labs we did pox

01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,040
and we are running a customer friendly

01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:38,960
size and we are actually live

01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:40,800
with thousands

01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,800
few thousands of customers and we are

01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,199
now looking for partnerships

01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,719
to scale that up and make sure that we

01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:50,080
we can roll this out across our

01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:54,400
footprint starting in germany

01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:54,400
terms of open apis

01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:01,840
the real promise of 5g

01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:04,400
is obviously network slicing

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,320
industry connectivity but we also

01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:09,760
believe there is more

01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:11,600
there is um we have defined control

01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,040
points

01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,880
in terms of how do we want to

01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,360
collaborate with hyperscalers

01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,080
and what is strategic for us so for us

01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,520
the network

01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,960
is a platform rather than just a python

01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,480
connectivity

01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:29,520
and we are trying to make use of common

01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,440
apis to drive monetization

01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,960
even in hyperscaler partnerships in the

01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,440
future

01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,640
and then last but not least in terms of

01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:41,520
um

01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,520
leveraging the cloud for the telco

01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,880
we think finally with 5g sa core

01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,640
as already mentioned with some of the

01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,239
previous speakers we have the right

01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,360
technology at hand

01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:54,400
to as a foundation to drive drive cloud

01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,719
nativeness

01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,640
in an operator environment and for us at

01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:02,400
deutsche telecom 5g

01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,679
core sa which um we did very recently an

01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,880
announcement is

01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:10,640
the first cloud native network function

01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:12,719
um at deutsche telekom and obviously

01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,040
we're gonna build on that to drive

01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:17,120
network slicing and development of

01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:20,719
end-to-end capabilities

01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:23,280
for customers b2b and b2c

01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:26,239
and we have running trials with multiple

01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,239
leading suppliers

01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,320
um for those of you who are following

01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,719
deutsche telekom

01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,719
uh you know that the zero touch

01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,920
automation has been a vision which we

01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,400
have been heavily

01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,960
vocaled and promoting for many many

01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,480
years

01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:45,679
um and we have been active in

01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,800
in multiple organizations in the

01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,199
industry

01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,679
driving the economy as driving the

01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:54,560
community towards that vision

01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,560
and we we obviously automation is a

01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,520
transformation which we started

01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,520
years ago and it was domain by domain

01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,679
project by project and i think we

01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,800
have achieved the point but for me if i

01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,320
look um

01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,440
from now onwards is about harmonization

01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,000
and scaling up

01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,640
so that you can reuse and reproduce

01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,679
those

01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,679
uh uh those solutions across

01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,760
across your network and across different

01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:22,159
countries

01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,199
we really believe in engagement in open

01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:26,560
source

01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:29,520
and standard interfaces and

01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,480
to drive apis for successful integration

01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,480
and

01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,719
i firm personally believe that this is

01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:39,520
key if you want to master

01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:42,640
the disaggregation you need to master

01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:45,840
the apis and the interfaces and the

01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,840
integration part of that

01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:54,320
now we are a big player in the community

01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,800
as i mentioned earlier on uh in oran as

01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,760
you know

01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,040
um um we have been a founding member in

01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,400
fact um alex

01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,360
dr alex choi is the ceo of the orion

01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,960
alliance

01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:09,280
we we heavily

01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,480
focused on disaggregation strategy for

01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:14,719
the run part

01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:18,159
on oran and for the first time

01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:20,719
at least to my knowledge the event

01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:22,000
from day one we planned this to be not

01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,159
just another park

01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,080
or another lab actually we have

01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,960
developed the concept what we call oran

01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,920
town

01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,760
which is which is a big program run by

01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,960
the best people in the company

01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:38,400
cross-functional team between a group

01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:40,719
and people from germany

01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,679
czech and other places within our

01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,960
community

01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:46,560
which is about to bring auran to life

01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,080
and the all-around town is actually a

01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,199
life is is a physical

01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:54,320
area in the live network in germany

01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:55,280
where we're going to build um an aura

01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:58,560
network

01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:02,159
5g aura network and where we want to

01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,560
not only test and see

01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:06,320
in a real scenario the behavior of the

01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,440
network and the customer experience but

01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:11,760
most importantly

01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:14,880
we want to have that network integrated

01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,600
into our oper operational procedures

01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,640
which is one of the most difficult tasks

01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,040
and there where

01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,320
onap is coming to play so we have

01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,360
decided

01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,800
to develop a service management

01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,840
orchestration

01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,880
for for the around town fully based on

01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,400
onap

01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,000
we have completely up gear the amount of

01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,480
resources

01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,199
and our engagement in this case to make

01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,520
sure that

01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,040
we learn we take the community but we

01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,159
are also able to adapt

01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:48,800
the learnings and make sure that

01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:49,440
we are ready for the next modernization

01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,679
cycles

01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,480
with the full end-to-end open-run

01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,520
solution

01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:59,120
which actually can be operated

01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:01,440
for better operator great uh class

01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,719
given you know our our dna as the

01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,600
network leadership

01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,199
and quality leadership uh brand who we

01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,120
are

01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:12,800
and another thing i want to mention is

01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:15,600
that um

01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,120
the engagements in all of this uh

01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,560
different for us

01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,840
has enabled us to influence to

01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:26,320
participate

01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:29,760
and to contribute um on the journey

01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:32,400
for the transformation but it remains

01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,960
one major challenge which i like to um

01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:38,400
address

01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:38,400
and to actually have a call for action

01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:44,560
um if we are honest with each other is

01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,000
all these initiatives over the last

01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,040
seven ten years

01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,280
have been the the the foundation of that

01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,800
was always a thought

01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:56,960
there is something we want to address

01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,000
or some bright people can be the idea to

01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,719
address

01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,080
and they believe that it cannot be done

01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,480
the standard way

01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:06,000
by other classical traditional

01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:09,360
standardization bodies for

01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,600
multiple reasons speed coordination

01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,640
so they uh people are coming up with the

01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,960
new initiative

01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,800
and i have to say now looking back over

01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,040
the last couple of years we had one in

01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,280
the

01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,480
initiative and they are growing like

01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:24,239
mushrooms

01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:27,360
now all of them make sense

01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:29,760
the problem is we are disaggregating

01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,280
so we have i think one of the most and

01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,080
this is this is my plea

01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,280
uh uh to the whole forum and the to our

01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:39,199
industry is

01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,320
we need to make use of all this for us

01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:43,199
but we need to be

01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,320
careful because we are risking in

01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:47,120
redoing work

01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:48,080
there is a bit of competition and from

01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,000
an

01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,920
operator perspective and i'm sure for

01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,159
the suppliers is the same we have

01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,440
it's basically the same resources so you

01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,199
have a resource pool

01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,960
which you need to put on all these for

01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:02,640
us and try to drive and

01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:05,040
to manage so my plea would be let's work

01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,760
more together let's see where we can

01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,679
collaborate

01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:12,159
more and where and be very precise

01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:14,159
what topic we want to address where to

01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,280
make sure that we use those forum as

01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:19,520
best as possible

01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:21,679
and don't create any kind of overlap and

01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,719
and any kind of let's say duplication of

01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:27,679
work

01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:29,600
and number two is we have um

01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,199
in terms of at the end of the day

01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,239
whatever we do

01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:37,360
we don't want this to be another track

01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:38,480
we want one track of standardization so

01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,080
there needs to be also

01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,159
a feedback loop and i think that was

01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,480
mentioned again earlier by

01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:45,280
one of the presenters that we need to

01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,040
make sure that

01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,480
all these great initiatives all this

01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,800
innovation

01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,760
will ultimately found its way to the

01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,880
main track

01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:58,480
and doesn't stay as something let's say

01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:01,760
um an alternative because what it does

01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,400
is it it creates diversion and we are

01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,440
missing

01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:09,360
again scale opportunity now if

01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,360
um if i would have

01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,920
a couple of let's say wishes to

01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:18,800
history and i think to all the listeners

01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,320
from a telco perspective it's essential

01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:24,480
that we have to

01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:28,320
try hard to harmonize the past layer

01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:31,600
in order to low the effort of onboarding

01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:34,800
for all the different variation

01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,639
and inclination of operator class so i

01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,840
think we we need to really think

01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:42,880
to go one level higher and think about

01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,920
the ways to ha try to harmonize at least

01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,880
limit the number of variation in on the

01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,000
past layer

01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:53,120
to to enable

01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,480
fast adaptation why because if not there

01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:58,320
is a very high

01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,719
cost of integration when if you put that

01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,480
cost

01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:02,480
in every project you will realize that

01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:05,360
the business case won't work

01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:08,080
and a lot of time if you go for the cost

01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,080
you you're gonna

01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:13,199
not be cloud native or you you basically

01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,400
are not using the latest technology

01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:19,840
that's number one number two is

01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:21,679
with 5g standalone

01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,400
and again that was that was covered

01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,719
previously from the uh from i think was

01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,080
ericsson but from the operator

01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:31,600
perspective

01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:35,040
whatever we do in this space the cncf

01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,159
compliancy has to be there we need to

01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,280
make sure

01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:42,560
that the the solutions are compliant

01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:45,199
so that um we are all

01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,760
in this industry able to monetize the

01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,080
the

01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,199
the uh the infrastructure and expose

01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,199
apis

01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:54,000
and then obviously um i've been

01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:56,960
following um

01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,639
the development of onap and i think

01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:02,159
became far

01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:03,840
a long journey however my plea is

01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:06,400
we need much more engagement

01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,880
particularly from the operator community

01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,199
we need more engagement if we want this

01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:14,239
to be

01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:18,320
if we want to this to be a solution

01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:22,080
where the local adaptation is just

01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:23,920
part of the job but not basically

01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,520
needing to working out many many

01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,320
different aspects of the solution which

01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,360
is still a bit

01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,320
um in development we need more operator

01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,400
engagement

01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:34,480
to with all the experience from

01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,520
integration day-to-day operations all

01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,159
the pain points

01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,679
this needs to be fully covered and we

01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:42,320
are we are super committed

01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:44,080
we are putting a large number of people

01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,719
uh in all these initiatives

01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,719
and driving that and again we are happy

01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,639
to work together i think

01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,159
if there's a biggest learning in the

01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:56,400
telco industry is

01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:56,400
you compete on customer experience

01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,800
and wherever it makes sense and legally

01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,600
allowed

01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,400
you collaborate on technology

01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,840
development

01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:10,400
and technology innovation and with that

01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,960
i end my presentation i'm happy to take

01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:14,560
questions

01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:17,120
thank you oh very good

01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,920
russia excellent excellent call to

01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,520
actions

01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,840
and uh you know the questions are coming

01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,440
in

01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:26,000
uh i would like to make sort of three

01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:28,800
quick comments uh on yours

01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,199
as well uh you know it was just uh last

01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,239
o

01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:33,120
s in eu when dr alex choi actually

01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:36,480
presented

01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:38,480
or launched the concept of around town

01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,000
you know in just less than even six

01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,080
months it's been

01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,760
such a big success you know thanks to

01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:46,159
you and your leadership

01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,920
particularly excited about the use of

01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:50,719
onap and the contributing

01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,639
community so that's kind of very good um

01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:55,920
i like your reuse and

01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:58,639
reproduce statement you know as as

01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,360
as as you scale and as you kind of get

01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:02,880
there

01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:06,080
um on the past i do want to uh

01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,480
bring up to the attendees as well

01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,280
a new project called xg villa has been

01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,600
uh

01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,760
incubated into lf networking it's kind

01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:16,239
of a contribution from several

01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,840
service providers globally that is

01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:19,679
looking at the past problem

01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,360
and and kind of standardizing it so your

01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,159
call to action there is absolutely

01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,800
important

01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,560
and then on the cloud native as well uh

01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,199
cncf and lfn are

01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:30,320
extremely tightly working on the whole

01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:34,080
definition

01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:37,360
uh testing workbench etc so absolutely

01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:40,320
great insights there's one question

01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:41,280
that has come up which is uh would dt

01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,400
prefer

01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:47,679
if uh 5g iran

01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:50,960
were completely standardized around oren

01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:54,239
or can uh

01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,960
you know there be a partial auran with a

01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:58,880
co-existing proprietary ram solution

01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,320
work also in the interim right like how

01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:04,239
do you envision

01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:06,840
uh the full journey to oran

01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:08,000
based solutions from from where we are

01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,840
today

01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,400
very good question thanks for that and

01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:15,040
to be honest um

01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,719
um if you if you ask what v vision and

01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,639
what we wish obviously

01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:22,880
um it has to be for us um as a carrier

01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:26,719
grade one uh type of uh

01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:29,520
um requirements it's essential that it's

01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,239
oran base and ultimately uh all the

01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,159
orange

01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:34,080
standards should be uh the whole

01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:37,199
specification should be adopted

01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:40,880
sooner or later with gpp so uh um

01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:43,199
as i said earlier on uh you

01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,639
and we have seen this in the past in in

01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:47,280
many different areas

01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:48,719
you uh the the biggest success of the

01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,840
mobile industry

01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,639
has been that there were uh intel

01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,679
ability

01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:59,520
across the world for different purposes

01:26:55,679 --> 01:27:01,440
um now what has happened is with that

01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,600
it was great and you know i'm i'm

01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,000
someone who is very proud to spend 20

01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,120
years

01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,280
uh soon 21 years into telecommunication

01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:11,120
and i've been following you know the

01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,840
hype before 3g

01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:16,239
you know and the big the big

01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,960
disappointment on 3g

01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:20,639
the great success of 4g and now with 5g

01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,760
however we have to admit

01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:27,440
the standardization to uh of today

01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,480
is dominated by suppliers who put a lot

01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:32,239
of effort and

01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:35,760
yes and so sing iran is a closed system

01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:39,440
so with or with uh um

01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:42,560
with the orange lines the idea is

01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:44,639
not only to open up interfaces to have

01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,719
an alternative but basically make that

01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:48,960
the de facto standard of the future

01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:50,560
along the way and that's what our plea

01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,400
and that's where we are working

01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,639
together with our with our other

01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:57,040
operator uh community as well as our

01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,040
partners

01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,239
gotcha now this is exciting very

01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,320
exciting and i'm

01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:03,520
we really appreciate all the leadership

01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,320
uh from

01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,600
from deutsche telekom on on the uh open

01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,679
source world exact

01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,280
absolutely so thank you for taking the

01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,639
time very insightful

01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,400
uh you know i'm sure the community

01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:16,400
gained a lot especially your call to

01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,040
action so thank you very much

01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,040
you're welcome

01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:26,000
alrighty um and so to

01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:28,960
wrap it up i want to present

01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,239
two quick slides as a summary uh so if

01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,360
you want to sort of put that

01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:35,120
up uh it's all collaboration and open

01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,679
innovation and you must have seen

01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,800
through the

01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:40,239
the rest of the uh three days that we

01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,800
focused a lot on that

01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:43,600
uh so if you go to the next slide uh i

01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,320
showed this

01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,199
as an architecture diagram and you heard

01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,760
the theme

01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:51,520
uh you know from disaggregation to

01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,920
re-aggregation right so

01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,880
from poc to production right chris rice

01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,360
said it well

01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,800
arash said it very nicely right how do

01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:01,280
you do collaborations

01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,400
between these projects so that they can

01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,679
be used in an

01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:08,320
end-to-end uh solution we heard from

01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,199
uh from on our networks on how a

01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:12,159
proposal

01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:12,480
to do a 5g super blueprint could be done

01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:16,480
in

01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:19,040
in lf networking uh so i think

01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:21,120
the the the industry is moving from

01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:23,840
these individual projects

01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,159
to gluing them together for deployment

01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,760
so

01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:28,080
not only are these projects deployed

01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,400
individually but the integration is all

01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,159
becoming open so it's right open

01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,520
solution so if you go to the next slide

01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:36,719
which i showed

01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:39,440
uh this is why when i open the

01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:41,040
industry open onif i showed this slide

01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,400
and it may not have registered

01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:47,920
with everybody but you now can see

01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,199
that we had presenters from multiple

01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,920
verticals that are

01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:52,560
wanting to use open source in their

01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,199
industry

01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,840
they don't know everything but they do

01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:58,000
know

01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,360
that this is the way to go forward we

01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,440
heard from madeleine today on the

01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:05,600
broadcasting industry right where

01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:09,040
onap and oran or network slicing or an

01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:11,440
sc play a large uh uh

01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,320
building block we heard from the the

01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:15,600
government of

01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:19,040
uh or and dod yesterday or sorry on

01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:21,760
on uh on wednesday uh we have

01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:22,719
heard from governments and other uh

01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,600
policy

01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:26,880
uh from from developing countries in eu

01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,639
apac etc

01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,320
right where there's a lot of global

01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,880
connectivity going on you heard

01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,000
brian talk about that in in the facebook

01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,159
presentation right

01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,159
how do you drive it into the remote and

01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:40,400
the rural areas build on these

01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:41,199
in open source projects and then most

01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,520
importantly

01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:45,920
the enterprise networking industry right

01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,000
whether it's private frag glt

01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,760
uh you heard from sean on all the

01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,679
end-to-end visibility and monitoring you

01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,920
heard from walmart right trying to drive

01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:56,480
visibility across their workloads

01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,040
and then most importantly you heard from

01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,280
several

01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,639
of these verticals in the edge and iot

01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,600
space that are

01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,560
utilizing unique applications on uh

01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,679
cameras or

01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:11,280
sensors or manufacturing or retail so

01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:13,600
this is all coming together and we

01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,560
are really excited that you know we have

01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,600
been

01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,520
an enabler uh to help facilitate

01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,199
you all coming together and contributing

01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:24,080
