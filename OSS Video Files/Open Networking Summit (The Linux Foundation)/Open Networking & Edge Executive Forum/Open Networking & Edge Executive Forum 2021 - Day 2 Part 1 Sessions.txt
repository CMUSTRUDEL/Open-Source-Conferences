and good evening um welcome to

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,960
onif uh as we call it open networking

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,840
and edge executive forum

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,200
we are really excited this is day two of

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,239
the conference

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
uh as you know we have set this up in

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
three different

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,239
time zones so that people within that

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,760
time zone can attend and

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,520
and listen to some of the top executives

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,000
who are speaking uh and and on behalf of

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,800
of onif so thank you very much for

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,879
joining us

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,359
i'm your host arpitjaspura i head up

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,920
lf networking and lf edge among other

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,119
projects at the linux foundation

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,880
and we have a very exciting lineup of

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
speakers today

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,640
uh they are top leaders from

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,759
asia and uh they are all very well known

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,479
leaders in the telecommunication

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,119
edge and the cloud space so we're going

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,080
to cover

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,640
a lot of ground today and without any

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,159
more

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,560
uh delay i want to introduce

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,720
our first speaker but before i do that a

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,960
few housekeeping notes

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,320
uh if you these are live so if you have

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,960
questions please ask them

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,439
through the chat and it's located the q

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,640
a button is on the top right of your

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,000
screen also

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,360
uh this is being broadcast in 16

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,759
languages

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,799
so if you want to hear in a different

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,240
language

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,799
there's a button uh below

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,000
the world widget so if you look at the

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,840
at the bottom right there's

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,160
something on your screen called world

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,720
widget click there and pick your

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
language

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,200
and if there is any questions there is

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,480
always the events

to answer any faqs so with that

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,520
let me introduce uh one of the first

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,080
speakers today

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,760
uh we have four in this session we will

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
have a break and then we will add three

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,120
more

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,760
very very powerful lineup uh the first

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
speaker

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,680
is mark shen who is a senior technical

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,800
manager at tencent

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,840
and obviously a board chair for tars

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,840
foundation uh tencent as you know

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,280
does not need any introduction they are

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,040
very active in

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
our edge community in our cloud

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,680
community along with the tars

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,480
foundation so without any uh further

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:05,840
delay

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:05,840
please welcome mark chan

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,200
okay um good morning everyone

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,040
i'm mark from tencent i'm the chair of

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
cancer open source alliance

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,480
and the chair of task foundation

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
government board and

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,200
also the tsd member of linda foundation

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,519
according to aztec

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,840
it's my practice to share with you today

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:35,440
about tencent's practice

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,440
on cloud and edge okay let's bring

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,400
the next thing okay first of all let's

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
discuss

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,480
why do we need edge computing when

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,640
it comes to cloud computing lm will

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,040
immediately bring up central

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,760
cloud computing um central cloud

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,799
community

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
is a central architecture and the

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,879
computing resources

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,280
are located in the central computer room

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,239
and

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,040
maintained by the car vendors on the

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
other hand

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,120
as computing is a kind of disability

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,840
computing

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,080
computing resources are scattered closer

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,799
to the data source to achieve the

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,760
purpose

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,479
of providing services nearby mainly

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,239
because

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:23,120
the needs of scenarios are

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,080
constantly changing many transitional

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,160
industries

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,280
have put forward more new information

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,880
transformation needs in general and

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,720
computing can benefit for aspects

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,000
like larger capacity lower latency

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,600
lower cost and support for localized

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,360
processing and it will be widely used

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,720
in different areas like cloud gaming

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,840
and smart office industry internet

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
and so on so

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,680
but um you know there are also some new

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
challenges that come with the edge

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,360
computing's

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,720
the nearest uh light heterogeneity

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,759
is the potential uh this is reflected in

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,160
both software and hardware

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
for example the central card and edge

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,520
cloud usually

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,720
use x asas and linux standard releases

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,120
in contract edge resources are likely to

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,240
be

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
cheaper or customized software and

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,720
hardware due to the

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,919
need consider cost and special business

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
requirements

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,479
as you know yeah and the second is that

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
the scale is huge

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
because according to officer

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,639
organization

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,280
the number of global iot devices will

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,600
receive

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,800
100 billion in 2025

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,680
um disability worldwide how to

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,560
manage that last scale equipment is also

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,199
a rarely

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,600
challenging task and the third one is

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
that

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,520
um the environment is complicated

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,840
um the equipment located in the car

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,280
computer room is okay

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,680
and a large amount of terminal equipment

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,880
is often located in harsh environments

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,680
for example a lot of equipment in steel

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,400
mills

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,759
is in high temperature environments for

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,960
a long time

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,840
the device network environment is also

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,919
various weird and wireless like wi-fi

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,160
4g and 5g network db

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:43,360
and etc and the first point is that

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,240
the standards are not unified

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,160
there are no standards in many places or

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,360
there are many standards but

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,000
not widely you you can recognize

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,199
standard especially in management

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,599
methods

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,479
uh the result of all these challenges

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,400
are like

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,400
as you can see in the slide low

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,120
efficiency difficult to manage

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
and uh low reliability

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,599
yes okay and now i will take about

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,080
how tension faces these challenges

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,520
let's have a look at tensing cloud and

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,759
ad infrastructure

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,199
the central count usually refers to the

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,800
idc computer room

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:30,639
and the az cloud will be the ecoc

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,680
mac computer run in turn fuel devices

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,479
are generally located near the data

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,120
stores

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,599
such as a home gain weighing traffic

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,440
light

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,479
interaction generally the delay

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
between the iot device and the s device

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,000
can be

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,440
controlled within two weekend

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,360
milliseconds

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,759
as suitable for processing business data

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
with

00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,800
extremely high real time requirements

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,240
such as industrial control services

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,479
um the delayed view with the edge

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,160
cloud can be controlled within 10

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,879
milliseconds

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,560
which can meet the requirements of

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,400
real-time audio

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,759
and video business in nearest ar vr

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,960
and cloud gaming tenzin

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,319
has accomplished many

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,120
used case based on this infrastructure

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,440
such as tensions car gaming products

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,800
like

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,560
regain star cloud gaming and the hd

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,880
video and live streaming

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,399
like kansas video and we have a product

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,360
called we see

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,479
the connected car and the intel italian

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
navigation

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,399
and tencent meeting and uh you know uh

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,040
live june

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
and uh we have tens of documents are for

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
smart

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,880
uh for the smart office and tensor iot

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,959
link

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,399
is for the iot and besides cancer also

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,240
helps a lot of

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:06,000
products from other companies that

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,720
panda with cancer they are in different

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,440
fields like education live streaming and

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,320
marketing

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,320
and extra i will show you later

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,720
and attention works hard to manage those

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,519
challenges through hardware and software

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
ways

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,760
for about the hardware tencent has edge

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,080
computing machine ecm which provides low

scenarios

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,160
um like about the software tencent open

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
source um

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,760
several projects just like the super

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,200
edge

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,519
and task super ad is an open source

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,880
container management system for edge

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,040
computing to manage

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
computer resources and container

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,600
application

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,959
in multiple edge regions open source um

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,399
three months ago and

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,600
with all our members that you can see

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,279
in the slide and about the task that is

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,519
a high performance microservice

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,480
framework based on main service

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,760
and transportation with multiple

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,660
programming

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,240
languages as um also and

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,440
[Music]

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,160
integrative administration platform with

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,880
implemented hosting services we have

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,399
festival scheduling

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,440
tasks with open source in 2013

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,160
and also we found a foundation last year

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
and yesterday that is the first uh

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,240
annual

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,720
theory of house foundation and we have a

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
good

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,760
um server celebration for task

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,279
and tasks support like um x86 and

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,040
multiple platforms

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:56,959
including mac os also

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,959
lightliners and windows of course

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,240
and let's look super edge the super edge

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,199
has

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,000
the following characteristics like the

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,920
kubernetes

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,279
native of course elijah adds extends the

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,240
powerful container orchestration

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,600
and scattering capabilities of companies

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,279
to the edge

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,399
and the kubernetes users can leverage

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,480
ad easily for edge environments

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:32,040
with minimal learning and

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,480
like the second point is that um as

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,160
autonomous and when the network

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,760
connection between the edge

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,440
and the car is um

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:48,480
unstable or the uh edge node is offline

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,480
the note can still work independent

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:55,680
um and the third function is that like

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,240
disability no healthy more monetary

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,959
super edge can continue to monitor the

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,959
process

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:05,519
on air slides on the outside

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,079
and declare healthy information for

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,279
faster

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,199
and more accurate preparing discovery

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,959
and reporting

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:18,320
and it can also build in as

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:21,279
orchestration capability super support

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,560
automatic deployment and multi-region

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,600
microservices

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,360
aside services are closed loop

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,399
and it it effectively

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,000
uh reduces the uh of the

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,279
operational overhead and improves the

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,320
uh four currents and

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,440
aware of availability of the system

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,959
and the last one is the lag tuning

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,839
should add ensures that companies knows

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,440
can operate under different network

00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:01,360
situations a support network

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,360
during using tcp hdb and https

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,399
the second open source project is task

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,839
tasks can quickly build systems and

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,880
automatically generate code taking into

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,000
account easy of used

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,560
high performance at the same time tasks

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
supports

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,720
multiple program languages like you can

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,920
see in the slide

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,120
including c purpose uh golem java

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,639
node.js

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:35,040
and php and python

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:38,320
task can help developers and enterprises

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,320
quickly build their own

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,000
unstable and reliable disability

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,440
application

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
in microservices manner so that they can

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,519
focus

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,240
on business logic to improve operational

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,240
efficiency

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:03,920
effectively and task is working

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,480
in past level it can run on physical

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,439
machine virtual machines and also

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,720
containers

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,480
and including the docker and companies

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
you can store tasks

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,959
you can you can store task away data in

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,679
cache also like db and the other file

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,000
the traffic

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:51,360
violation and etc

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,640
like we have also just the other

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,160
blooping

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,360
arvr bluepin and uh that

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,080
simulates a cost uh disproving

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,720
similarities

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,919
of cash loan to improve the teachers and

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,679
students online

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,440
education um experience

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:15,120
and the um

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,480
last one okay the 5g

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,760
mac and slide system bluepin

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,720
is target is to support cloud gaming hd

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,799
video and

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,799
live broadcasting

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,679
and let's see about the

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,720
um case and there are some

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,760
um use cases in kansas practice the

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,960
first one is the

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,760
power gaming edge computing machines can

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,280
improve the user experience by deploying

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,000
cloud game servers on edge nodes

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,720
reduce the delay of use operation

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,240
feedback

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,919
and improve the fluency of the picture

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:04,000
and the end-to-end

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:07,440
interaction of the game is strong

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,640
the edge of a blitted arjun

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,799
is attracted to the nearest public

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,559
network through the local

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,039
operator line the server in the main

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,720
node is assessed through the tension

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,000
cloud priority network

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,559
and like reducing the latency and

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,600
enhancing the user experience at the

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,320
same time it can

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,679
achieve multiple points disaster

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,880
recovery on the

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,919
public network's assessed side

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:44,880
and reduce the bandwidth

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:46,960
cost of the public network

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,000
uh the second one is the video live

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,120
streaming it is

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,480
from that is the uh tensions partner

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,200
uh with tanzan call edge computing knows

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,600
covering the whole region of china in

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,640
relying on high performance computing

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,400
and low latency network products and

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,360
services hooyah provides a

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,640
low latency high definition stable

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,039
interaction video

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,120
and live streaming experience for a

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,640
large number of users

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,280
during the live broadcast as computing

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,480
transcoding and destruction have been

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,720
implemented

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,120
plus provides main services and low

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,360
balance with

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,360
supports automatics during after

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,960
about needing memory transmission

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:42,559
and why why obtaining a low

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,720
network delay the center's pressure

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,240
is reduced and the central bandwidth

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,080
cost is safe by

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:53,919
more than uh 30 percent and the network

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,720
connection delayed of aging is less than

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,120
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,159
minutes which provides the upping

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:04,080
quality and viewing experience

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:07,840
okay the last case is that

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,240
um smart city water sales and here i

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,799
take

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,480
intelligence water solution fashion as

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,600
the use case the system

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,679
can dynam dynamically

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,720
model and analyze the video as computing

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,760
image organism

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,760
and the vision technology the skill of

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,960
the supervised water area

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,960
is obtained by the skin

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,240
semantic segmentation or user

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,720
defined wing and the system

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,520
realized intelligent water management

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,440
from

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,640
normal sewage disaster

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,080
series exchange and

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,279
reward and water source supervision

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,880
by detecting and classifying

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:02,000
the starter parts with your picture

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,520
we can judge whether there is a

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,799
sewage exchange behavior for the

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,000
target detection organism

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:16,000
we can get the real-time location are

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,440
throwing objects or people should

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
ship among the coast in the water area

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,120
we can

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,640
analyze whether there is an

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,840
injection or other prohibited

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,360
carrier or create the

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,480
early warning and realize that efficient

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,840
and the time dynamic management of water

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,279
area supervision

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,640
yeah okay

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,480
that's all yeah thank you thank you

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,240
thank you mark that was very insightful

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,240
a lot of the blueprints in akron are

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,480
very exciting and tencent you know

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,600
is really really leading this so thank

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,520
you very much

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
uh we're going to move forward now with

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,840
the next presentation

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,120
uh bill ren who is the chief open source

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,000
liaison officer

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,279
at uh huawei gm in in the ict

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,720
infrastructure group

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,840
uh very very uh you know strong leader

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,159
he's been presenting

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,679
and his vision and the leadership that

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,360
they provide is extremely good so

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,050
without any further delay

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,550
bill go ahead

00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:22,550
[Music]

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,360
early time and all our help friends

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,159
and good morning to everyone i'm

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,799
bill jelen and from huawei i'm glad to

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,780
share

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,880
our thoughts about

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,000
[Music]

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,880
how to enrich the faculty

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,559
to be business and make sure the

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,440
industry nonjack system

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,880
can bridge the gap of digitalization

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,000
okay

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,279
please go to the next page and as you

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,480
can see

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,440
we all know the first intro industry

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,440
revolution is

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,640
rising and but we do need to realize

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,559
this time the fourth time industry

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,919
position is totally different as the

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,200
first three runs

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,400
no matter its age of steam

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
or electricity or information before

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,080
it's all

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,279
from supply side it's focused on

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,640
productivity

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,440
demand like the productivity quality

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,799
efficiency and consistency but this time

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,279
the more

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,720
driving from demand side it's more

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,159
focused on value

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,159
and then the information information

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
personalization requirement and

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,520
diversity requirement is more important

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,799
so this require a platform to do this

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,559
so next page i will talk about

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:52,080
how to do this as as you can see

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,400
the 5g network is constructed globally

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,760
and the collaboration of connection and

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,440
computing

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,000
is a key and for enabling the industry

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,159
to

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,159
do the digitalization so that's why we

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,039
think valgey should serve as a

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,240
cornerstone

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,279
for the first industry revolution and as

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,480
well

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,039
in the middle we think a unified and

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,960
open

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:20,080
mic platform is crucial to make sure

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,559
we can promote those industry

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,480
applications to go a large scale

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,240
application to go mature

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,520
so that's why we believe the 5g mec

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,320
solution is very critical and we we do

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,440
think

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,600
the unified platform is is important so

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,559
next page

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,799
but what's the challenge uh i will talk

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,640
can you go to the next page please

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,840
yeah as you can see the

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,039
file 2b has do a lot of

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,520
prover concept project globally

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,440
it's claimed there are more than 6 000

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,000
of pocs ongoing in the past

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,039
two years they are focused on so many

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,600
scenarios

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:09,039
from call manners hd video

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,559
and a lot of smart campers

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,600
harbor and as and so on

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,240
but still people think

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,960
that is difficult to do the replication

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,240
of this

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,240
those applications in your uh

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,080
large scale so what's what's the reason

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,799
what's the challenge we are facing

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,080
we believe because of there is no

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,399
unified platform

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,679
so all the innovation we start

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,360
and do it from scratch every year

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,159
and there is no closed loop of a

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,559
business so the motivation for

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,440
for those doing those industrialization

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,559
the revolution

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,200
is is make people more frustrated

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,200
so that's why we we think

00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:00,399
a unified platform is needed so

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,440
next page i will talk about how to

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:07,039
uh what's the key reason behind this

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,320
you can say uh we we clearly see

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,120
during this project the huge gap between

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,919
the industry

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,399
knowledge and the 4g ict technologies

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,520
you know

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,919
in 5g or in ict technology we all talk

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,600
about

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,640
5g club cloud machine learning

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,000
and others

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,880
such as superlink the the

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,200
dynamic loading but for the industry

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,039
they

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,159
could not understand those terminology

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,760
experience expertise more focus on

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:45,200
industry know-how such as uh

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,240
the project product control quality

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,720
control

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:55,279
and and many other uh industry process

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:59,200
and uh sourcing related scenarios

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,399
so just like what's the famous uh

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,440
poet poster tag girl men

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,320
gave this speak speak famous saying

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,399
the first distance in the world is not

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,679
where i stand in front of you you cannot

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,640
seem see me or understand our what we

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,200
are talking

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,720
so that's the case what we are do it's

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,080
happening in the ict

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,799
industry so next page

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,320
but how to how to solve this problem i

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,960
will talk about it

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,480
in the next page so you can say uh

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,000
building this industry knowledge

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,799
ecosystem is very

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,799
critical so the industry knowledge

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,600
experience and expertise is just

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,559
like this pyramidal from erp to mes to

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,840
scatter

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,360
to the sensor controlling and even some

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,960
field manufacturing

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,960
but how to replicate those

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,679
knowledge and the experience you even

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,320
use success in one project

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,080
because it's so huge it's difficult you

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,399
know such a large

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,159
granularity to replicate it so we have

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,960
to decomposite it

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,320
to make sure we achieve a lot of atomic

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,200
capability just

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,760
like in the software macro service based

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,799
component

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,039
library so this could make

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,039
the project and the knowledge be

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,840
reusable in large scale

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,279
so you can see we can based on this

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,559
macro service

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,919
based component we can reorganize it

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,720
in based on the new scenarios

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:38,080
based on the new process to do this

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,320
presentation then we can achieve

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,960
those applications here more large scale

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,000
make it more possible and feasible

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,039
so that's why we believe we do

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,679
need to build such kind of capability in

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,039
the whole

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,120
industry so next page we will see how to

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,679
do it

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,600
again another observation we found

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,860
during this

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,120
the first

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,760
[Music]

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,880
industry revolution the digitalization

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,000
we've found

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,480
we should not only do the digitalization

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
you know

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,320
in the past we like a project

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,320
based

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,720
so the digitalization should be

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,440
happening

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,039
in across the industry collaboration so

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,480
the cross-industry collaboration

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,880
the most important is the platform

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,880
in the connection because every industry

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,600
every vertical industry

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,200
especially those top players they all

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,320
build their platform

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,440
some of them even aggregated in

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,760
industry level they have some

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,720
some kind of a unified platform like a

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,919
predicts

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,919
like a siemens like

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,159
some some other ball polls they all have

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,120
a different

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,399
platform so they all wanted to do the

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,840
digitalization and

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:05,360
reduce their expertise and

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:09,279
experience so how to make sure this

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,919
platform this expertise can

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,399
leverage the ict technology so we we

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,399
need

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:20,000
lab for this knowledge software pretty

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,960
precipitation with those api capability

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
from

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,600
ict porn video based on the new

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,640
business scenarios so there is a

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,480
lack of industry platform to bridge

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:38,399
this gap for the ict convention platform

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,600
so next play next page you can say

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,760
uh in the left hand side the industry

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,519
requirement

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,919
based on different vertical industry

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,159
knowledge and the right hand side of the

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,600
technology supply based on the open

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,640
source

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,519
practice so we believe open source and

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,080
openness

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,679
will be more effective methods for

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,039
building such a

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,640
unified platform to make sure the ot

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:10,480
iit plus the ct can work together

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,079
very well okay next page

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,200
that's why we think in the 5g

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,200
mec area we

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,240
that's why we built this open source

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,839
platform we call it

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,440
edge gallery uh open source project

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,800
it's how three key value first is the 5g

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,639
native make sure

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:36,000
this uh 5g native connection capability

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,480
and the more accessible and the

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,520
second is agitating platform

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,639
architecture

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,639
make sure those services trustworth

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,960
and the third one is the diversity the

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,679
open edge ecosystem

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,679
so we we build this architecture from

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,200
design time to runtime make sure it's a

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,359
closed loop

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,040
based on the edge security and edge

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,240
infrastructure in place

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,520
so here i'd like to show with

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,520
with you to quick quickly give a

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,040
give you a video about how this edge

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,119
gallery looks like

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,200
please play this video thank you

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,280
edge computing empowers an intelligent

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,079
society by becoming great avenue for

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,079
carriers

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,359
enterprises and vendors to build new

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,800
opportunities via best utilization of 5g

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,040
currently 5 gmec application development

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,200
integration and commissioning poses a

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,400
lot of difficulties due to heterogeneous

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,440
platforms

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,359
open unified 5g mec platform is need of

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,359
the hour and edge gallery as solution in

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,359
this direction

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,800
the edge gallery platform community

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,119
focuses on the 5g

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,720
edge computing scenario through open

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,320
source collaboration to build the

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,200
framework of resources

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,880

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,680
infrastructure

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,079
to achieve this at gallery constitutes

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,839
four major modules each focuses on a set

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,760
of functionalities pertaining to the

being made by various ed gallery

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
community partners

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,920
edge gallery has introduced the labvis

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,680
service which allows the community test

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,599
lab to operate with much higher

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,320
efficiency as a result of their larger

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,280
scale

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,760
dedicated management and proper tooling

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,920
this provides significant capex and opex

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,400
savings and also improves the quality of

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,560
tests being conducted

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,720
ed gallery community is expanding with

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,280
currently 35 plus participating

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,079
companies with 111 authors and more than

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,839
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,920
500 commits come join us on this great

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,640
journey of open source collaboration to

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,780
build a world-class unified 5g mec

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:56,640
platform

00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:59,520
[Music]

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,200
yeah so next page so thank you for

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,119
watching this video you you

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,200
probably maybe got a big picture of

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,480
what edge gallery looks like you can see

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,640
it's more focused on

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,920
application and preparation

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,800
integration testing and application

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,480
release and the deployment so we can

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,240
build a

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,599
mirror valgey environment in our lab

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,400
in the community to help the application

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,520
the developers industry players

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,400
enterprise

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,000
even our operators to build this

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,040
application report

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,480
repository together and then we

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,960
ewing could deploy it in an industry

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,839
uh production environment in carrick's

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,640
network

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:53,599
that's our intention so next page

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,320
as you can see the edge gallery so

00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:01,440
extend this value capability to the edge

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,440
and promotes this knowledge ecosystem

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:13,599
and edge gallery is more focused on the

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,599
multiple roles

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,520
from developer side will focus on

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,960
developing environment

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,680
and this application developers and

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,720
traders

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,480
more focus on application repository and

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,079
there's a

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,200
and a printer set in this

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,520
preliminary environment to do this

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,359
management and the deployment of mec and

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,160
then mep

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,280
and also as well as these enterprise

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,319
customers

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,960
such as we have two use cases here one

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,400
for

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,720
to be a business like the robot company

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,440
to

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,319
how to deploy that robot application in

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,359
our platform

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,680
the other is where players how to deploy

00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,560
where applications in our platform

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,560
so next page

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,440
and the edge galleries has started to

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,880
formally open sourced in last august and

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,400
they were

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,079
very actively cooperate with the

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,560
industry mainstream

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,839
standards and open source organizations

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,040
such as 3gpp

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,480
gsma open platform

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,599
and etsa muc standards

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,160
as well as linux foundation is a

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,040
key player in the open source we

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,160
actively

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,319
involve the edge umbrella project and we

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,960
build our blueprint in the

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,200
community so also we work with other

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,400
alliance such as flg dna

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:47,119
ecc and a

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:50,400
fg aia and other organizations

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:53,760
okay next page so

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,800
finally as you can see the

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,760
5g is just started value 2b

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,920
is a is a beginning as we always know a

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,200
journey of assaulting mass begins with a

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,800
single step

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,599
we believe this false industry

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,680
revolution and the digitalization is a

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:17,599
long way to go but we do

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:20,000
need to look at it in a more

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,359
growing weight just like grow seed in

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,400
the in the soil

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:29,599
so we have to do it in a right way to

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,400
build a common open source community

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,480
to to reach the common standing common

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,800
framework combat texture

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,839
to lab to bridge those industry

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,160
ecosystem

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,280
with a technical access as well as this

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,160
business exit

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,200
to make sure that develops the industry

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,240
expertise

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,359
and the end user for enterprise to work

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,400
together

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,119
in a sustainable and continuous way to

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,560
make sure

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,839
we can reach the target so that's why

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,160
i asked for other industry players

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:06,079
especially for the

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,480
technical operators the no matter is you

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,480
are

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,720
from technical side you are from

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,599
equipment manufacture windows side

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,880
or you're from enterprise said we need

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,079
to work together

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,119
in your open and

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,880
you know software way to make sure the

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:28,160
force digitalization can be reachable

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,800
and can be invisible and we

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,400
we believe this is the right thing to do

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,440
thank you

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,839
thank you bill uh

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,280
thank you there's uh i know we we have

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,119
very limited time but there are a couple

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,359
of questions i would like to ask you

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,160
one quick one if you could answer it

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,680
quickly

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:52,160
do you think that edge gallery

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,599
is kind of needs to be done

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,280
vertically different in different

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,319
regions of the world

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,200
or so lo is does edge gallery require

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,599
localization

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,520
or does it have a unified approach

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,280
across the world

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,400
sure that's a really a good question

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,599
as we we say open source we believe from

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,839
beginning it's the

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,960
shoulder band by natural it should be

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,839
global so

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,240
when at the beginning once we think of

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,480
should

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,079
those open source community open source

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,760
platform options project

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,400
which we always think it should be

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,480
global but as you can see from past

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:34,319
one year those global

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,720
pandemic scenes we start from

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,839
asia area mainly from mainland of china

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,359
we focus on

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,440
the top three operators in china as the

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,720
first step but we already started

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,680
working with our

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,040
european partners and as well as other

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,880
young

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:56,880
other areas so we are definitely

00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:00,079
believe from our initiative

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,000
target it should be global okay very

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,920
very good i think there was another

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
question in a similar way in which i'll

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,880
probably answer as well which is

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,880
uh you know does does this require uh

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,599
you know does companies and an effort

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,480
require

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,359
a partnership with u.s and europe uh

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,240
companies

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,359
or you know do you do it on your own and

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,440
i think the answer

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,119
is very clear right bill said it right

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,800
yes yes open source

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:30,400
global collaboration yeah as you may say

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:34,079
we open sources actually we always

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,000
do it also in github so it's uh pulling

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,119
could be it could be easily reachable

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,920
and uh

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,720
yeah very good very good thank you very

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,119
much bill

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,920
very insightful uh glad to have you on

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,200
board

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,240
thank you thank you bye-bye

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:53,839
very good okay so moving on

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,720
uh the next speaker no introduction

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,119
and uh you know he is probably i would

00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,680
say

00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,640
single-handedly if not with his whole

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,280
team

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,480
turned the world upside down of

00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,400
telecommunications right and

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,400
and uh you know i think from the geo

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,720
days to the recording days

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
uh you know he's a thought leader which

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,280
we all who we all admire

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,000
uh we look forward to hearing him all

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,480
the time

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,200
he's always got some you know some crazy

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,599
some real

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,520
some actually very cool ideas that we

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,680
all would like to hear and borrow

00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,079
so without any further delay please

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,310
welcome uh you know tarka means cto

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:37,760
frackington

00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:39,839
[Music]

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,760
thank you very much our pets nice to be

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,800
with you today

00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,760
as usual i really really enjoy

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,960
this type of forums because it gives me

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,480
um

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,520
a path to discuss you know the main

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,839
building blocks

00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:00,800
of how we envisioned having an open

00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:04,000
disaggregated uh cloud native uh

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,920
network so um with that to do let me

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,280
start my presentation just giving

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,359
everybody

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,200
a little bit of understanding about what

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,240
is really racket and before we are a

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,400
mobile operator

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,079
i think i've spent a lot of time talking

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,640
about this before

00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,000
and one of the primary reasons um that

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,040
attracted me

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,359
to move from india and come to japan

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,800
was really this large massive ecosystem

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,920
a company that really has

00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,880
in the beginning um fundamentally no

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,480
business uh to do with telecom it is an

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,680
internet-facing company that is in

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,480
banking

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,880
and e-commerce and digital payments

00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,119
sports because we believe that has a big

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,359
impact on branding

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,400
and various uh content and media

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,160
application

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,480
so it is to my knowledge the first time

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,280
that an ott internet company

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,559
had a desire to really enter

00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,640
connectivity

00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,720
for me personally i thought this is a

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:04,319
great opportunity

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,800
to influence a direction to change

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,680
the underlying foundation of how mobile

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,119
network

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,079
is built today and sustained towards a

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,319
path

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,520
of software upgradability towards the

00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,680
future

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,440
uh building a foundation that does not

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,160
depend on hardware a foundation that

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,079
really

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,760
is built on a merit of elasticity

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,079
resiliency and cloud in every component

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,079
in this network something that i always

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,240
felt and believe that we resisted this

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,720
change for different reasons

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,000
whether it is readiness of technology

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,440
readiness of

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,880
organization and so on so a glimpse on

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,920
the journey in rocket and

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,440
mobile as we entered you know just to

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,720
give you a perspective

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,800
we haven't been in this business for a

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:55,359
long time in the mobile side

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:58,480
uh i joined uh rakatan in june 2018

00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:01,440
and when i remember when i came to japan

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,839
i within the mobile division there was

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,960
about six people

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:09,359
part of my excitement when we talk about

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,880
and when you hear in the industry that

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:13,119
rakatan was able

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,720
to build a fundamentally new platform

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,880
architecture because it's a green field

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,400
i say you're absolutely right

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,960
but what is the definition of green

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,119
field it's about green field

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,599
as in mindsets mindsets of people and

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,000
organization that i needed to have

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,000
in order to build this dream and yes it

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,079
is absolutely a crazy idea

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,720
and the idea was to build a network

00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,359
that's completely disaggregated

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,119
taking the most complex workload and

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,040
starting with an area

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,800
that i really would tell you i am so

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,559
glad that at least rakatan now is

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,079
opening up the debate on this industry

00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,240
around open iran

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,280
and the importance of openran to our

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,559
evolution

00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,119
so we went from um uh you know i uh

00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,640
starting from april 2018 when we were

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,480
aboard the spectrum

00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,839
we launched in less in less than two

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,040
years uh

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:04,960
and built our backbone uh new platform

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,520
architecture and our cloud

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,079
in a record time now how we've enabled

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,599
this

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,599
is having an absolute fundamental belief

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,640
that we needed to achieve the following

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,480
four big pillars

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,079
in our platform build out number one

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,079
and this is the most important thing for

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,119
this industry the radio must get

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,160
disaggregated

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,000
this is no longer in my opinion about a

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,040
dream this is more of a reality

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,640
it was too important to push to get this

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,480
aggregation on radio

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,880
of course it has an impact on costs and

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,160
it was significant impact in both alpecs

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,880
and capex

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,920
but i think a lot of people will realize

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,040
what i already see

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,400
and what my team see is the biggest

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,520
impact of disaggregation clarification

00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,559
of the network

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,559
is what happens in the third pillar i am

00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,480
i call this maybe in the telegram

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,440
industry we need to bring sexy back to

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,319
telecom

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,520
get us into a discussion point at

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,800
autonomy

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,400
a network that runs on its own a network

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,680
that discovers issues that

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,559
is able to heal itself and he unable to

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,520
grow

00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,200
uh without interventions from back

00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,880
office operation and so on

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,480
so this was really really critical on

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,000
the strategy level

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,079
and uh on openran you know we

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,240
pushed in the in the early days it

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,480
wasn't simple it wasn't very easy to

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,599
convince and even i think uh i

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,880
mentioned this before um i spent an

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,680
enormous time

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,000
trying to convince um nokia in the early

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,280
days

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,119
that this is a good thing for them a

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,200
good thing that to open their

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,480
interfaces on their remote radio head

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,640
allow us to

00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,160
do the integration with our open rand

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,200
software vendor and in fact they did

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,359
this and i and i

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,960
tell this all the time this is the

00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,160
carriage that is needed in this industry

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,160
to move forward

00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,680
but we quickly diversified the supply

00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,800
chain and the supply chain was about

00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,119
hardware

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,119
massive diversification of hardware sets

00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,319
from macro mini macro

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,800
small cell enterprise femto

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:09,359
and a highly innovative completely oran

00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:12,160
compliant 5g platforms for both

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,720
millimeter wave and subsex and and what

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,119
a world of a difference now we have seen

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,440
our open rand platform architecture was

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,079
not built just to achieve only

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,119
capex reduction but the critical thing

00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,720
that happened with it

00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:29,760
is a philosophy and an idea that

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,480
our licensed radio products

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,680
need to behave exactly like wi-fi access

00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,440
points

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,440
they need to have zero touch

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,640
provisioning they need to have flawless

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,880
automation

00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,440
on how you configure them we need to

00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,440
abandon legacy organizational structure

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,960
and move forward into a new world in

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,880
which autonomy takes the

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,640
essence of the dna of how you run and

00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,720
manage these networks

00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,000
and in the context of doing so we

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,800
realize actually

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,960
the minute that you have achieved mass

00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,880
scale automation

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,480
now this is where the elegant uses cases

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,119
starts to come about

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,240
when you disaggregate and from day zero

00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,800
even on lte

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,240
especially on radio you have the

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,200
separation of cu

00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,800
d u and in 4g and packet core you

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,400
implement user plane function

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,200
disaggregation

00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,839
we decided to build the world most

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,559
advanced and largest mobile edge data

00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,720
network

00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,000
uh in japan and and to my knowledge i

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,960
think this is actually

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,559
the largest across the globe um we've

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,000
commissioned in less than

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,680
14 months over 4 300 data centers that

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,760
are not manned

00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,880
fully autonomous on how we configured

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,200
our racks

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,559
how we installed the workloads how we

00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,240
moved from

00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,880
a hardware-based bbu to a software-based

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,599
baseband running on our far edge data

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,440
center

00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,520
all of this is connected through a

00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,599
massive optical backbone

00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,839
that supports photonic mesh this is

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,319
where the future use cases for 5g as we

00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,720
look at

00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,640
edge this is what i am looking forward

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,440
to is what are the undiscovered use

00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,760
cases

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,880
that are going to take advantage of this

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,839
massive

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,960
scalable edge architecture and the ultra

00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,520
low latency that

00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,640
we will deliver uh to the application

00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,280
layer

00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,280
and uh in terms of uh we also got asked

00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,319
well how the network is running in japan

00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,119
is it really

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,960
a network that only works in rural areas

00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,640
is it a network that scales can it

00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,400
support the capacity

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,720
that's needed i mean obviously i would

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,559
tell you tokyo is not a rural area tokyo

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,440
is a very very dense area

00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,319
we carry a significant capacity in our

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,160
network

00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:40,000
and we started with the premise that

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,480
everything in the mobile network must be

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,359
built on an ipv6 architecture

00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,000
since inception we have almost zero

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,400
outages

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,200
on services due to the reliability that

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,480
we implemented

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:56,000
on the core we have now uh

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:58,559
had the largest network functions

00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,040
deployed on our cloud platforms with

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,240
over 800 core network functions

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,720
fully virtualized fully redundant and

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,240
completely orchestrated this is unique

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,839
the uh metrics uh and performance kpis

00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,680
that we see i think these are world

00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:17,440
class if you look at

00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:21,119
drop call rates um and even better

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,640
the rcs which in in rocket and mobile

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,400
network today

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,960
north of 87 percent of our traffic

00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,680
passes through our rcds application

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,040
because we have

00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:35,280
accepted that voice is an app so we

00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,720
abandoned this concept and philosophy

00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,160
that we need to fight for traditional

00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,920
legacy services

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,400
and in avoid innovative enhanced

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,680
messaging and and voice

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,760
on cloud the entire mobile network has

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,799
been built on two hardware types

00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,520
completely commoditized and designed for

00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:56,000
ultra simplicity and driving also

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,359
automation and better and easier

00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,319
inventory management uh in our platforms

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,960
on radio i think this is an area where i

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:06,559
as i mentioned before

00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,000
demystifying the secrets of radio is

00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,200
really vital

00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,520
and and this wasn't easy i i'm not gonna

00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,319
kid

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,760
anybody that to go to open ran in the

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,559
early days for rakatan

00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,920
was a nightmare a nightmare to get the

00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,799
software to work

00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,760
at scale it is very different to say

00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,480
that you could do

00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,839
one poc in the lab and connect a few

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,520
devices and say that you have

00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,520
accomplished a great job

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,799
but what we wanted to prove that you

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,359
could connect up to 700 devices

00:56:33,799 --> 00:56:37,280
simultaneously

00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,880
and the system can scale and the

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,960
software can behave

00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,240
and the underlying cloud and the changes

00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,839
that we have to do

00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,040
to make the cloud telco ready believe me

00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,640
this is not trivial

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,200
there's a lot of things that we have

00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:54,720
done to make sure that the software

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:57,040
uh workload of radio

00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,119
is running at scale and delivering the

00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,040
performance and reliability

00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,160
and then the parts that i am personally

00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,359
so thrilled about

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,400
i mean of course openran and the core

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:10,240
and the cloud are all great and this is

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,480
the parts that i get thrilled about

00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,760
is now what is the undiscovered

00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,559
opportunity

00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,200
that uh that we could unlock this is

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,799
about all

00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:24,240
automation you know moving into a

00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:25,599
relentless way of how you need to run

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,400
and manage the network

00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,359
it is truly very very easy for me to

00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,400
tell you that

00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:34,319
on the core network today it is

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,440
i don't have hardly any operational

00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,000
people

00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,280
i on the radio side we started now

00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,119
saying maybe we don't need field

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,720
technicians because i removed all of the

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,799
electronics from the site

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,119
and i managed them in an unmanned data

00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,799
centers with enough resiliency and

00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,760
healing on the underlying

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,880
platforms so the automation is so

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,359
critical and so

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,119
important but it's an end-to-end story

00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,920
and it's not about a function into the

00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,240
network

00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,760
we spend a considerable amount of time

00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,920
building the systems

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,119
that is is carrying today racket and

00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,119
mobile network

00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,359
and the objective for all of this is

00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,319
just about customer delight

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,880
problem discovery problem resolution in

00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,520
a much

00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,480
more agile manner than it ever has

00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,839
happened before in

00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,720
in this industry one of the key things

00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,240
that we have done

00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,760
is the investments that we have done in

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,520
our own what we call racket and

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,599
communication platform

00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,280
is a creation of something i haven't

00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,000
really shared this with with anybody so

00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,319
i'll share it on

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,520
on this forum this is what we will now

00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,160
announce to the world

00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,200
in uh in june of this year is the

00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,599
availability

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,799
of the world first enterprise telecom

00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:44,559
app store

00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:45,119
the entire management plan that anything

00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,040
you need

00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,119
from inventory management performance

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,559
management configuration management

00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,200
vnf cnf lifecycle management digital

00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,400
workflow

00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,799
incident management every tool set

00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,839
could you imagine now it all resides in

00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,839
a simple

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,480
microservices non-monolithic

00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:07,520
architecture completely cloud native

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,520
to minimize complexity and allows you

00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,680
to drive more productivity and

00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,359
efficiency into this network

00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,680
this is something that we are really

00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:19,280
really thrilled uh to share

00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:21,599
and start to really discuss with uh

00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,960
with prospective customers of rocket and

00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,960
outside of japan

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,400
to materialize the stream of an open

00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,240
platform

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:32,319
towards oss bss and orchestration

00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,640
and running and managing today in

00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,599
tomorrow's networks

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,799
and then one might ask okay well so what

00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,599
great technology

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:42,640
what does this really mean to society

00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,319
what does it mean

00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,000
to i think all of us have talked about

00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:49,599
it in one industry forum or the

00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,040
other about the number of unconnected

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,520
people across this world

00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,280
but the importance of connectivity to

00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,359
society transformation

00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,359
so i'll share with you that the

00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:02,000
underlying cost structure

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,119
of rocket and mobile network i think

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,680
it's offering us

01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,280
an unbelievable opportunity to

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,400
completely re-imagine

01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:13,520
how we offer our customers our

01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,280
rate plans data consumption plans etc

01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,640
we did something i believe has never

01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,200
happened in the world

01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,160
and we offered now the complete

01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,040
connectivity

01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,760
up to 1gb for free for life this hasn't

01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,079
happened at

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,160
all but in order to achieve those

01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,920
metrics you know we we really thought

01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,280
very carefully about

01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,440
how we're going to manage our cost

01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,559
structure how we're going to manage our

01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,160
uh revenue and

01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,480
make sure that we have a sustainable

01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,079
business as well so if you see this and

01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,400
if you walk into a rocket and store

01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,160
today both offline and online there is

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,280
only a single plan

01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:52,880
there is not multitude of plans one plan

01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:56,559
that starts with free if you consume

01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,839
less than 1gb you will not have to pay

01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,359
anything and by the way this includes

01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,960
international minutes as well and

01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,960
international calling and

01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,880
and so on and then you have a ladder

01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,640
that that uh

01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,000
that you could pay depending on data

01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,200
consumption model

01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,839
but at best uh at war

01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,760
sorry if you go to an unlimited model

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:18,160
it's about 27 us dollars

01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,839
for a completely unlimited plan in

01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:23,200
rocket and network

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:24,880
and um for us i can't tell you that the

01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,960
approach that we have taken here i wish

01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,520
i had a bit more time to tell you

01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,480
how we negotiate with our vendors now

01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,480
this wasn't easy

01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,160
every vendor that came and every partner

01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,280
that came to rakatan

01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,880
i spend enormous time of energy to

01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,240
educate them about the importance of

01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,880
open source

01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,079
and i have classic examples that we have

01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,000
taken

01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,839
proprietary software stack and

01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,280
completely made it open source into our

01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,799
platform architecture

01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,200
so the first rule of engagement with

01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,599
rakatan can you make your platform open

01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,480
source

01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,720
i will embrace you help you support you

01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,119
and show you path to revenue

01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,720
and you know lastly i'll lend into this

01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,200
i mean obviously our vision

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,640
is to revolutionize this telco industry

01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,680
we wanna help

01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,480
we wanna partner and we wanna be

01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,240
open completely open and collaborative

01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,559
on a new world and a new approach

01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:21,520
on uh how we go not just only in japan

01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:23,599
but provide lessons learned and provide

01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,559
valuable insights for anybody that is

01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,200
willing

01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,160
to to think about a world that is driven

01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,400
by software

01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:32,079
not driven by hardware i think this is

01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,119
the value that we could bring into

01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,799
to the table and this is uh you know our

01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,119
hierarchy and dream

01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:41,280
is the realization of what we call our

01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:43,760
racket and communication platform

01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,760
targeting four pillars one is about

01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,000
cloud and connectivity

01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,319
two is about network functions three is

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,200
of uh intelligent operations

01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:54,480
and fourth is about digital marketplace

01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,640
experiences

01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,559
um so i hope this has been informative

01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,240
for everybody and and uh maybe i'll hand

01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,000
it over to you just to

01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,680
see if you have any questions or answers

01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,799
yeah no this is

01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,319
this is amazing tariq i mean i'm

01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:10,400
i'm sure you're going to be bombarded

01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:14,079
with questions but let's take a few

01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:17,119
uh right away uh how big are your

01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:20,319
thousands of edge data centers um

01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:22,400
typically so so we put uh about

01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,319
uh one to two rack and it could be the

01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,240
maximum is up to three racks i i

01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:28,880
basically host uh

01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,559
anywhere between the the first true far

01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,680
edge workload today

01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:37,039
is my vran workload and and

01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:40,559
uh so we host right between

01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:44,880
30 to about 98 sites or so

01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:48,079
on on our edge platforms there is 4

01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,599
300 and a little bit higher than this

01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,799
today that we've deployed in japan and

01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,520
by the time we're done

01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,480
maybe we'll we'll end up at around uh 4

01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,000
800.

01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,920
i know this number might seem quite a

01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,760
bit but there keep in mind these are

01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,799
completely unmanned

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,640
uh they're autonomously managed and

01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,400
um you know the use cases that we're

01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,039
gonna look for is

01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,280
what can we enable next like maybe about

01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,799
our own cdn to be deployed in a few of

01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,000
these locations

01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,160
uh because the distance between the site

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,039
to the far edge is only 30 kilometers

01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,319
it's not that far

01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,400
yeah okay okay gotcha any breakdown on

01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:26,799
ipv4 v6 traffic

01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,319
yeah so so this is a this is a really

01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:31,280
interesting thing i mean

01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:32,079
when i when i came in here um this was

01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,880
more of a

01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,760
cultural issue you know to to educate

01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,359
everybody

01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,039
that part of the contractual agreement

01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:43,039
that i even did with my own vendor so

01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:47,039
the traffic inside my network

01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:49,280
100 ibv6 so i mean just imagine this

01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,960
fundamental transformation and thinking

01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,640
i mean i i'll tell you one

01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,559
one quick thing even when we started our

01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,680
own rcp journey as you know

01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,559
ipv6 on kubernetes world was not even a

01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,880
g8

01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,160
at least yet yep so to go through these

01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,799
basic and change that

01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:09,119
today we drive right about 70 of our

01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:11,680
traffic is going through ibv6

01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,599
internally a hundred percent and uh and

01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:16,160
externally we'll keep driving this and

01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,799
and i call it uh you know i have an in i

01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:22,000
have an external promotion department

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:23,680
that encourages the utilization of ipv6

01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,359
including with third-party companies and

01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,079
third-party websites

01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:30,319
to encourage them about migration to

01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,440
from ipv4 to ipv6

01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:35,920
very good i know we have several other

01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,240
questions we'll probably take them uh

01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,400
take them offline uh i think i'll take

01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:43,440
the last one here which is

01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,960
uh as you move to obviously you have

01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,880
you've been a big supporter of open

01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,839
source for sure um

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,440
and and and then in terms of

01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:52,480
disaggregation obviously open ran is is

01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,119
or or n and

01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,799
you know things are important i think we

01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,839
are seeing the world telecommunications

01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,599
providers also

01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,880
move to an open source world which is

01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,119
very encouraging

01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,920
uh and they're dragging standards along

01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,079
right etsy 3gpp etc so what's your view

01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,280
on sort of open source and open

01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,079
standards right as

01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,920
as they move forward you know this is uh

01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,280
so so first of all i i will tell you

01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,920
standards are extremely critical um

01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,880
in terms of their relative importance to

01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,520
bring

01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,039
the industry towards uniformity on the

01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,119
creation of the solution

01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,799
but i but i also will tell you i i have

01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,839
a maybe a slightly different point of

01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:32,000
view

01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:33,839
it will always be factual thing that

01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,559
standards will take time to evolve and

01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,440
develop

01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,960
and now what i would suggest for people

01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,319
to consider and think about

01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,039
is it doesn't mean we as enterprises

01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,400
should stop

01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,559
evolving it doesn't mean that we

01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,359
shouldn't stop exploring

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:50,319
partnerships and models of collaboration

01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:52,559
i think for me

01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:54,720
right now it's becoming clear the beauty

01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:58,079
about open source is just unreal

01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:00,799
unreal when you have the whole world

01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,039
working with you to collaborate to

01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:06,079
co-innovate to co-develop

01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,400
and in certain contexts it's okay if you

01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,799
are

01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,119
slightly ahead of standards and you go

01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:14,480
back in and try to fix an address

01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:16,160
but i i much rather be agile than just

01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,119
to say i'm just gonna wait for years

01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,160
until

01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,960
the perfect thing comes across so i i am

01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:24,720
i am so thrilled about this community

01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,920
aspect i feel like there's a family and

01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,000
the family

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,599
understand the value of what they're all

01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,520
contributing towards

01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,960
um and you know surprisingly i'll tell

01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:35,599
you about this

01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,359
i i we started showing the vendors how

01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,760
to make money out of open source

01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:41,839
and they're liking it it's a great model

01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,920
it's a really win-win for everybody

01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:45,839
absolutely i think that is a great

01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,920
statement to end and

01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,200
we really thank you torika thank you

01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,480
thank you for taking the time

01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,400
thank you thank you really i appreciate

01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,760
it all right

01:07:52,400 --> 01:08:00,240
okay uh for the next presentation

01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:03,039
we have uh you know one of the largest

01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,079
uh service providers in china uh china

01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,760
telecom

01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:11,920
and we have uh sun kyung

01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:14,960
uh who is in the sdn research center

01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,839
at china telecom and uh

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,520
they are thinking ahead on how to move

01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:22,960
not just automated network but

01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:26,319
automation into intent based

01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:29,120
so it is a very fascinating journey

01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,440
that you know i know i am very excited

01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:39,520
about but without any further delay

01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:42,719
please take it on

01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,560
okay thank you thanks avi yes

01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,239
and it's my pleasure to take the

01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,520
presentation here

01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:53,520
um okay so let's start

01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:57,040
our uh slides uh

01:08:53,520 --> 01:09:00,080
uh next please yes

01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,640
uh in in this presentation i will just

01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,520
focus on uh our cloud network

01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,080
convergence

01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,199
uh this is our strategy for china title

01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,440
and i will discuss

01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,319
about the scenario of intent vista

01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,120
network

01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,080
and also our current research and the

01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,359
development

01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:20,719
of in ibm network okay

01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:23,920
next please

01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:27,040
yes this is uh uh i think this is

01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:30,400
uh very familiar for all of you

01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,520
and uh we really have increased demand

01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:35,040
for cloud network

01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:38,080
convergence from our customers and our

01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,880
industry uh from the point of view of

01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,440
cloud network

01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,080
convergence i think we have different

01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,520
phases

01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:48,640
for example uh in the first phase uh

01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,520
our customers supporting system and some

01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,319
applications

01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,719
will transfer to the cloud or our

01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:58,159
application will be cloud native

01:09:54,719 --> 01:10:01,840
so the customers will need different

01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:02,719
connections from their site to the cloud

01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,280
they need different

01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,320
kinds of connections like high

01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,920
availability

01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:13,199
and high quality and low latency

01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,800
but to the next phase and

01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:17,520
when the application and the

01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:21,520
requirements become more complicated

01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:24,159
and they will need a lot of different

01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,960
requirements so we need to introduce a

01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:28,480
lot of different

01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,920
intelligence like ibm i think

01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:35,120
and after the third uh phase

01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,120
uh then the cloud will be just a part of

01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,840
the network and the network will be

01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,640
just part of the cloud uh there will be

01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,320
just in

01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:47,040
in one integration so in that part

01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,560
uh the network is just a lot of network

01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,760
devices will be built

01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,880
uh cloud native so in that phase the

01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,920
cloud and network

01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,840
will become more complicated and we

01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,560
we need to introduce a lot more

01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:03,600
intelligence in our supporting system

01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,600
so next please

01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,600
yes and this is the architecture of our

01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:15,440
overview of the cloud network

01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:17,120
uh in our city night 2030.

01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,520
this is a white paper published by

01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,880
china.com last year

01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,640
and in this whole architecture there are

01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,440
mainly three parts

01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,320
the first one is we introduce a unified

01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,800
cloud

01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,760
network infrastructure so in this

01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,120
structure

01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,920
uh we will have cloud and some and we

01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,640
will have

01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,920
different kinds of network and for the

01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,800
next

01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,800
next one is that we will have uh

01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,840
heterogeneous resources

01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,560
uh for example the 5g 6g internet

01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,840
obscene

01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,000
uh and the fixed line and satellite

01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,120
we have different heterogeneous

01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,560
resources and

01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:01,199
they will also to

01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,400
say connected to the network and to the

01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:05,440
cloud

01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,760
and the most important i think what we

01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,800
we really need and this is the missing

01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,000
part is

01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:15,920
the cloud network operating system

01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,360
this is a cloud cloud network

01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,199
a very intelligent brain and that will

01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,960
be very important to support

01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:28,320
such a large and the huge network

01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:31,360
and the cloud and to to

01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:34,480
provide our customer very good

01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:37,840
uh our service

01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,840
okay next please

01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:44,159
so uh i will discuss

01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,520
some details about the cloud network

01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:48,960
operating system

01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:52,880
actually uh in this in this architecture

01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:56,640
in the in the main part of this year's

01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,880
network cloud operating system and

01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,920
the operating system will need to

01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,360
abstract

01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:06,239
and manage and obstruct various

01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,040
resources uh including the network of

01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:10,400
the

01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:12,000
the cloud in a unified way and it also

01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,320
needs to support cloud native

01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,159
development environment

01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:20,880
and also we will abstract different

01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,600
resources from the network and the from

01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,840
the cloud

01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,920
and open it to third-party applications

01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,120
so different people can use these

01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,400
different

01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:36,400
capabilities and there are some

01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:39,600
major features here like we we need

01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,760
to have the digital wing to simulate and

01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,239
monitor the real-time status of the

01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,199
cloud

01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:46,320
cloud network operation system and we

01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:50,159
also need

01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:52,640
uh to have self-feeding uh capability

01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,600
and to have the self-adaptive resource

01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,199
scheduling

01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:00,320
capability and the very important thing

01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:01,199
is to have the intent based engine the

01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:04,480
internet and

01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:05,600
based energy is to collaborate all the

01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,920
different parts

01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,360
of the network and the using the

01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,560
analysis

01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:15,920
to control and the

01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:19,840
simulation and to make the whole network

01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:25,120
whole system uh very intelligent and uh

01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,120
automatically okay next please

01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:32,480
oh this we will so next

01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:35,199
we will discuss more about the intent uh

01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,800
basically intent based network is a

01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,960
self-drilling network

01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,840
uh we need self-driving and we do not

01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,159
need to introduce some more

01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,159
memory uh

01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:50,800
mandarin works so it is

01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:52,560
an intelligent worker can auto

01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,679
automatically convert

01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:58,320
and verify and deploy and configure

01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,480
and optimize itself so it is very

01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:04,880
intelligent and

01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:08,880
it will run very uh

01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:11,760
it is very reliable so it is

01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,320
it will automatically solve abnormal

01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,120
events

01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,679
to ensure the network reliable and it

01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,960
will

01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:20,560
achieve the target network state uh

01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,480
according to different application

01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:25,679
requirements

01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:28,880
uh this is ito uh

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:31,520
architecture of inter-based network okay

01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,520
next please

01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,400
so in our network we will see some

01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,320
scenarios and the

01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,880
real scenarios for internet-based

01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:44,239
network uh this year's

01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:47,520
cloud and the network convergence

01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:48,640
scenario and we see different

01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,199
applications will

01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,560
have different sra requirements for

01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:55,600
example

01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:59,120
the game and some security applications

01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:02,560
will need low latency and uh

01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,600
low latency data plane so they will need

01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,880
to choose

01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,440
a path that is low latency

01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:12,400
but some industrial will need high

01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,159
reliability and the low latency

01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,000
plane so they will have different

01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:19,360
requirements and also

01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,800
some monetary and the backup

01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:24,480
applications will need

01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,199
high bandwidth so we need to figure out

01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,560
the different

01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:34,400
applications needs and give the

01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:37,840
appropriate path coordinate next please

01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:40,400
and also this is a very uh real

01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,280
scenario what we we are deploying

01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,239
currently

01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,440
this is uh cloud edge and end

01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:49,520
collaboration

01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:52,400
in file g and mec actually we can see

01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,960
we will have a lot of connections and

01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,719
the

01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:59,120
applications uh and the content will

01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,920
will be uh in different parts of the

01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,960
network

01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,000
so actually the network itself will

01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,800
become more

01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,760
complicated if there really a problem so

01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,560
you need to

01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,960
figure out which part and you you really

01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,880
need

01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:17,840
a high intelligent system to help you

01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:20,000
to monitor the whole application the

01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:23,280
whole service

01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,280
okay next please

01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,080
this is the current our research and the

01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,360
development of intern-based

01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:32,480
network um actually we we have done some

01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,280
research work

01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,600
uh in the next in the past few years uh

01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,800
but

01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,120
currently we think really we need to uh

01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,000
bring the intent based network to the

01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,520
industry

01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:48,560
so uh we are doing some projects

01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:51,760
in on app and we have

01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:55,440
already uh uh have

01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:58,640
have a requirement in on-app release age

01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:02,480
and we will do the first step

01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:06,000
in 5g slicing this this uh use case

01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:07,920
and introduce the intent based network

01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,120
in the online architecture

01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,280
okay next please oh

01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,400
this is more details so if you are

01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,000
interested in it

01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:21,360
i think maybe we can take a uh

01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,320
uh take it offline and we can discuss

01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:26,239
more in the

01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:30,000
organizations in standardization

01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:33,440
okay next please and we also

01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:36,880
also set up a develop forum in

01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:38,880
february and this is a special session

01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,080
and we have different speakers from

01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,280
different

01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,440
companies and we we really

01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,640
thank you very much you too and we

01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,760
discuss a lot

01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:53,120
um of this how to how to implement

01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:55,840
and in different in online and how to

01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:58,800
modeling and the what's the framework

01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,800
okay next piece

01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:06,000
and this is our overview of uh

01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,679
internet-based ibm model based on on-app

01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,400
project

01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,040
in onap actually we think this is a very

01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,080
good

01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:18,159
uh choice uh to

01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:21,520
to to implement ibm because it is still

01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:24,800
it is already very automated

01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,000
and it has a control loop so basically

01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,040
it can match

01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,640
the ibm's requirement very very

01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:33,280
perfectly and so uh we first say we will

01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,640
introduce

01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:39,840
some nature language processing in ui

01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:42,719
and this will translate the intent

01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,040
automatically and after get the intent

01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:46,159
of

01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:49,679
uh uh we we will set up

01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:53,120
the monitoring monitoring module

01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:55,840
in dcae and using the closer loop

01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,640
we will do the monitoring we will do the

01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,360
policy

01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,320
and we also need to to set up as a

01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,679
controlled

01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:04,480
uh control configuration in into our

01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,120
controller

01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,639
but but here we have a missing part like

01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:11,760
the digital wing

01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:14,320
here uh we we need to verify

01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,320
uh the intent in the digital way to

01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:19,360
verify that

01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:22,639
the change will be good or not okay next

01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:25,920
please so this is the

01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:28,800
uh what we have already done in uh on

01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,480
app in red release age uh we have done

01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,520
the uoi part

01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:37,440
uh which is to put the intent

01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:41,040
into into the from from the users like

01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:44,400
text or audio then we use the nature

01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:47,120
language processing to to

01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,159
to map it into different complicated

01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:51,040
parameters

01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:52,159
for the network so the used users will

01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:55,120
be very simple

01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,679
to use the application but the language

01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,840
can

01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,960
network can still understand the

01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,000
language

01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,639
okay next please and the next we will

01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,679
also

01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:08,880
uh add some clowns close the loop in

01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:12,560
uh uh with ibm in on app

01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:15,840
like uh when after

01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:18,159
after gets the intent from the ui

01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,400
we will set up the monitoring we will

01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:24,000
upload

01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:27,600
the modeling in dcae and also we will

01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,320
optimize uh in oos to change

01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,960
like some resources and to do both

01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,880
policy

01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,679
and so and using controller to make the

01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,199
things work

01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:42,800
together next please

01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:45,920
oh kncc we think on that maybe

01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:49,440
we can do uh 80 of the id

01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:52,320
and work in uh in the ibm architecture

01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,760
but also we still need some other help

01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,679
and some other

01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,120

01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,639
project in

01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:03,760
our event for example uh we

01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:05,600
maybe we need some uh analysis and

01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,639
application analysis and the data

01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,080
analysis

01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,679
uh to do more intelligent from the

01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,960
acumen standard

01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:18,239
etc and maybe we can also uh

01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:21,760
interpret collaborate with odl

01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:25,199
and the open switch to to profess

01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:28,960
