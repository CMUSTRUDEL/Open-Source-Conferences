and two thought leaders who have really

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,119
changed the way we think about edge

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,440
in fact all the way from clarifying what

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,239
edges and defining what edges

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,840
to how to implement and take advantage

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,879
of it so without

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:22,510

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
that we see coming together in the state

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,280
of the edge

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,080

my name is matt gerfiro and i work for

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,080
an edge infrastructure company called

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,519
vaporio

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120

project

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,760
uh with my good friend jacob excellent

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,920
good deal okay so what we're going to

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,920
cover today is the 2021

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
state of the edge report which is a

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,879
collaborative and open source report

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,560
that we put together now

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,319
um under the auspices of the linux

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
foundation i'm going to try to click

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,640
through i'm having a little trouble on

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,480
the click so matt do you want to

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,959
do it for me i will great

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,400
uh there we go okay and the word

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,519
collaborative is super important to

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
everything that we do at the linux

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,040
foundation but especially to the edge

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,159
and this is truly a team effort uh and a

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,040
volunteer effort

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,000
in many cases so by um you know

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,560
preparing this

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
report uh under the lf edge and the

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,200
linux foundation

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,239
we you know have have subscribed to a

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,320
a uh an open methodology and that means

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,160
that that all are welcome to participate

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,960
and to join us as we prepare this kind

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,520
of content but this year was especially

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
um exciting for me because we had four

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,919
different expert authors which you'll

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
hear about

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,919
as we present the content as well as

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,919
just an awesome collection of

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,360
you know member company volunteers and

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,840
other people who join to help us

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
make the report possible so we get to

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,199
take the credit

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,479
here on stage but it's really um due to

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
these people who

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680
worked so hard over the last few months

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,520
so

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
uh just the other day i think it was on

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
wednesday we published the

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,199
third edition of the state of the edge

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,759
report and this is now

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
as i said under the lfe banner the linux

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,320
foundation

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
really excited about that because it

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,919
really reinforces that what i think is

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,600
probably the most important part of this

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,000
report is that it is

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,919
it is neutral vendor-neutral uh

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
collaborative and community-led and the

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,880
purpose

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
of that has been clear from the

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,039
beginning of the very first report

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,160
but it's even more true now and i think

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,759
as we go through

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
and look at the edge ecosystem we can

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,840
see examples of that collaboration

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
everywhere all right so what the report

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,479
um

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,400
looked into this year was five different

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,919
topics the first is really building upon

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,240
last year's report

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,600
you can find each edition up on state of

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
the edge.com

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,080
but last year we did a bottoms up model

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,880
of the edge computing ecosystem

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,960
to really see what's the forecast like

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
where's the money as you might say

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,320
and so we built upon that this year so

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,199
matt's going to talk about that first in

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
a minute

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,479
uh the next was with critical

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,240
infrastructure so obviously matt and i

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,000
both work for companies that are

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,520
um heavily involved in this but it's a

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,800
really interesting space right now so

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,199
i'll touch on that

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
edge hardware uh also networks and

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,880
networking and then

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
of course software so this is how we

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,840
spliced and diced the report

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,360
we're going to kick it off first and

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,800
foremost with the money man

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,800
go for it yeah good morning so as jacob

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
mentioned the entirety of the 2020

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,759
report which is also available for free

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,680
at state of the edge.com

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,039
covers the model uh that phil she

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,400
built for for us uh in quite a

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,360
quite a lot of detail and uh he updated

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,960
it this year

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,280
uh to um include additional information

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,160
uh primarily the impact of kovid

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,039
uh in accelerating a lot of the factory

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
automation

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,720
and remote operations that we expect to

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,479
see

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,880
and we've predicted 800 billion of

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,160
computing infrastructure spend and what

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,919
we mean by that is

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,960
uh that is the data centers and the it

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,400
equipment

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,039
required to run uh the the edge

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,840
workloads so that is data centers um

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,960
on on both sides of the last mile

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,759
network but

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,720
um for servicing particularly uh edge

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
workloads

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,319
and uh it's it's driven by two things

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,800
one is where do we see the growth

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,960
happening

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,880
globally uh and you can see in this

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,319
slide uh where most the growth is

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,479
happening in

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,440
europe and asia pacific and north

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,280
america but

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
certainly extending into south america

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,199
and africa

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,880
and also bottoms up again from each of

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,599
the different segments

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,639
so the analysis looks at the segments it

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
looks at the regions

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,919
it predicts growth of applications

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
driving uh

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,479
the growth in those segments and then

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,319
predicts the

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,120
it compute workload that is required to

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,599
support those

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
and then does a estimates the power

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,520
footprint

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,960
uh those of us in the data center

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,639
industry measure the size of data

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,560
centers by the amount of

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,720
power they can rectify and equipment

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
they can rectify so a one megawatt data

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,479
center

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,759
can has the capacity for a megawatt of

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,840
uh equipment

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,520
um and then the there are some you know

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,639
reasonable ratios of converting that

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
into dollars

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,160
and that's how we get to the 800 billion

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
dollar um you know it's a it's a

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,759
forecast

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,440
we don't necessarily think it's right

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,479
but it's a discussion and it's certainly

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,080
an interesting discussion

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,440
and it's useful to do these predictive

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,440
models and update them over time

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,280
um i'm also going to cover critical

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,639
infrastructure so you look at critical

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,720
infrastructure

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,000
this is uh these are the data centers

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,680
but they're also the

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,080
the towers uh the small cells the

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,080
fiber in the ground and the other sorts

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,919
of things required to drive

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,720
edge computing and um a lot of what's

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,279
what's happening excuse me if you think

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,959
about the

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,440
the internet you know it sort of started

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,320
in two locations may west and may east

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,360
and over time it's primarily expanded

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,000
from the

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
core out sort of like a root growing

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,800
underground

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,000
and so you have the very thick roots

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
where it originates and then they get

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,279
thinner and thinner and thinner

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,399
and the internet today that if you think

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,519
of like a backbone

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,720
uh the backbone kind of ends at

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,519
the the the key ixp

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
points the internet exchange points um

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,399
and

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,240
those are in major cities typically uh

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,959
in the us for example there's about 40

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
of them

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,080
uh and a lot of those are actually in

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
the same city so there's really about 20

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
places where there's this major

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,160
confluence of

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,279
of networks where one networks compare

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,040
and exchange data which is very

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,600
important to the internet

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,440
and as peering and data exchange has

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,680
grown and the number of ixp

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,279
points have grown uh you're seeing this

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
like flattening of the internet where

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,120
traffic doesn't have to go back to a

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
core or some far location to get where

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,240
it needs to go it can actually just be

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
exchanged more locally

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,000
and what's happened one of the major

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,600
trends is this this backbone

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,279
if you think of it is being extended out

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,839
from these tier one cities into these

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,760
tier two

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,440
cities into these tier three cities and

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,200
also within these cities

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,360
closer to the edge of the access network

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,000
and what that simply means it allows

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,800
uh two networks if i'm on verizon and

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
jacob's on

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,720
t-mobile and we are exchanging data it

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,200
could actually go through

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,720
a facility that is in the same uh city

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
we're in rather than being back hauled

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
to some

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
major city which lowers the latency and

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,839
all kinds of great things

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,279
um so these edge exchanges uh ways to

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,800
cross-connect networks are

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,720
emerging and driving a lot of the

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,279
critical infrastructure uh around

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,240
uh new fiber routes and new neutral

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,720
facilities

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,360
and what's what's off also interesting

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,399
is the the shared infrastructure

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,600
so um you know the the the thing about

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,240
the edge is there's

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,360
there's not enough power or physical

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
real estate

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,600
for every company every cloud company

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,000
every telco to actually locate all the

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
servers

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
are going to need and so what we need is

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,079
we need shared infrastructure we need to

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,160
be able to

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,519
to share a lot of the fiber and share a

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,120
lot of the

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,800
data center capacity and street side

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,560
cabinet capacity

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
in order to to allow for these complex

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
workloads and what's also nice since

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
there's gonna be a lot of these data

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,360
centers in the field

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,040
is we can deliver a new kind of

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
resilience um

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,360
in workloads by using high availability

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,240
software techniques like from kubernetes

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,560
and so on

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,000
uh where a workload can be in a one

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,000
location and if something goes wrong

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,839
it can switch over or fail over to a

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,079
nearby location with very little

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,040
disruption and that's reducing the space

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,440
and the cost

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,640
of all the it the the data's critical

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,000
infrastructure because you don't

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,040
need you know the same level of

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,560
mechanical redundancy

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,560
uh jacob you want to take over edge

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,160
hardware yeah absolutely

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
so like i said i'm sort of a hardware

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,120
nerd but not because i have any right to

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,880
be just because i love it

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,160
um but what we're seeing right now um in

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
hardware at the edge is a lot of

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,880
diversity

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,120
obviously it's a fascinating time for

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,360
silicon and also for

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,200
a specialty infrastructure that's

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,959
emerging primarily around how to process

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,279
more efficiently like matt said

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,560
um such an important part of the edge

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,079
and how to do it with

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,839
more um you know flexibility and speed

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,760
and so we're seeing investments and the

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,600
report talks about in open hardware so

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
form factors and ways in which

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
infrastructure can be secured and

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,880
distributed

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,800
and and also this idea and the promise

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,600
that we've seen originate in the

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,279
core cloud around specialty you say

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,639
offload smart mix this kind of thing

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,079
moving to the edge

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,480
where they're really you know very

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,639
relevant especially with programmable

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
infrastructure so matt let's move on

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,120
because we have a

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
we have a couple more that we want to

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,760
cover so you grab the network i'll cover

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,040
this one quickly

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,480
yeah so so the the networks both the the

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,399
networks in the ground and the wireless

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
networks are are changing quite

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
significantly

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,639
um you know the build out of 5g but also

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
the

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,200
cbrs spectrum and the ability to uh have

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,399
private wireless and unlicensed spectrum

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
is driving a lot of uh

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,680
expanded low latency edge suitable

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,920
networking

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,200
um the economics are changing because

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
again we have this shared infrastructure

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480
but not just like

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,839
shared towers and radios but shared

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
compute right we can

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,200
put multiple virtual machines on a

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,240
single piece of hardware and run network

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,360
function as well as

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,880
typical application workloads and as i

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,399
mentioned earlier there's new kinds of

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
interconnection peering happening out at

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,120
these edge locations and this is driving

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,079
a lot of the innovation

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,959
in networking at the edge yeah yeah in

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,720
many ways

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
you know the the genesis of the internet

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,360
from a networking standpoint and

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,519
interconnection is

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
defining how we look at things but in

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,639
other areas like hardware

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,079
thinking about more open you know more

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,440
flexible and and

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,680
obviously a lot of this is being driven

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
by software so matt if you could click

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,079
once more

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,519
software i think is one of the more

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,519
interesting parts of the report this

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,920
year that it's matured so much

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,600
right the cncf and its work over the

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,639
last few years but also the projects at

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,880
lf edge

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
and other places you know the community

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,680
aspect of solving problems has really

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,480
accelerated

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,160
what you know a few years ago when we

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,360
published the first report was really a

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
promise and a hope

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
um to a reality in you know real

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
deployments that are

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,560
orchestrated with amazing complexity and

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,240
that's really making the edge more

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,920
accessible and more of an innovation

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,920
spot a business driver

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,519
one of the things that the report pulled

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,880
out that i thought was fascinating

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,320
was the role of hyper-converged

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
solutions and marketplaces that are

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,959
extending from the cloud

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,519
you know making it easier um and to

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,279
you know to service customers who want

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,120
the benefits of the edge right

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,720
and so that's a real change that we've

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,320
noticed over the last few years from the

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,959
reports but especially this year with

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,040
the

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,959
with as matt said the focus on

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,240
accelerating transformation from code

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,800
can't be understated

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
it's put a lot of you know reality into

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,720
a lot of deployments that

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,720
um previously were more forward-looking

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,160
want to cover this for jacob yes please

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,399
okay

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,199
so i'm just gonna say once again at the

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,920
beginning

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,279
uh i mentioned how important it is to

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,839
have a team and and

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,720
involvement from the community uh this

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,760
is meant to be

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,959
um you know a way to reach beyond our

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
own circles

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,120
and find information there's a variety

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,720
of projects that the state of the edge

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
pushes forward including a glossary

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
which is in the report

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,360
and also a landscape which is ever

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
shifting

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,040
and so if you have questions about it or

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,120
you see things that are missing

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,680
come to us you know we're the co-chairs

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,360
of the working group but also to

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,880
you know to the state of the edge

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
project to get involved i mean it's

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,320
really that easy

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,519
it's to come and add your voice at your

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,920
you know perspective

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,519
and uh we really welcome it i think it's

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,839
really critical to the evolution of the

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,839
edge

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,480
all right i guess and uh to close this

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
out and i guess we have

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
time for questions our pitt if that's

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,519
when you want to yeah yes please

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,079
yeah so please download the report stay

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,079
the edge.com all all three of the

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,120
four of the reports uh from prairie you

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,720
know from this year and prior is

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
available free of charge and just for

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,320
downloading

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,000
on the on the website all right

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
hey this is excellent in fact some of

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,920
the questions were all around

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,720
where do i download it so lf edge state

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,880
of the edge

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,560
you know the links are all there uh i

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,360
think there are several questions

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,839
matt and jacob around this whole notion

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
of

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
data centers uh and equipment moving

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
from core to edge

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,880
to sort of uh you know further down the

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,920
network

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,759
and in that scenario you know what

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,959
footprint and how much of the footprint

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
do we see in

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,600
either micro data centers where there's

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,759
like 20 to 200 kilowatt facilities and

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
you know effectively give us some ideas

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,680
on on sort of the power management if

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,759
you may

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,279
i mean so so maybe this is actually a

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,360
little bit of both of us so

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,639
obviously these large regional data

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,079
centers are getting larger

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
and there are new ones that are being

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,880
built and uh there are

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,639
new regional data centers that are being

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
built in not just tier one cities but

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,519
tiers to the cities and tier three

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
cities i mean if you go to a tier one

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,320
city there are you know

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,000
big data center companies like equinix

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
and digital realty and

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,759
coresight and so on you go out to a tier

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
three city it's like bob's colo

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,880
and that's difficult for deployment

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,160
because you don't have a standard deploy

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
you don't have all the certifications

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,959
and things so a lot of these big data

00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,279
center companies are pushing out farther

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,240
to

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,759
put these you know well-run certified

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,120
data centers out in the field but also

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,799
like what my company does

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,640
is deploying these micro data centers

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,799
and these are you know

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
range from 20 kilowatt street side

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,240
cabinets to

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,360
you know 200 kilowatt like you know

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,839
school bus size

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,280
deployments and so it's it's a real

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,679
mixture uh of these and i think from a

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,199
from an

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,520
edge perspective an edge microtutor

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,959
perspective we see between now and 2028

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,079
about a megawatt per

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,960
s per city in you know in the us like

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,160
the top 50

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,000
uh u.s cities cool yeah

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,480
yeah absolutely becoming regionalized i

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,600
think one one important point matt makes

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,400
is that we're seeing

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,919
and the report kind of speaks to this um

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,799
you know customers looking for

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,200
ubiquity and looking for deployment like

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,200
as

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,520
as as everywhere as possible and that's

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,880
of course extremely expensive so we're

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,240
we're seeing some of the things pushing

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
out i think we see some of the major

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,160
cloud providers as well

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,000
coming in you know less on the you know

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,559
the infrastructure side but more on the

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
um

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,160
software and marketplace site all right

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
very good

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
hey that was very informative and i

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,640
think uh

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,280
if if if the registry registered

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,039
folks have not downloaded the report you

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,520
know absolutely go for it

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,960
this is an amazing set of collateral but

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,880
more importantly i would say you know

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,760
participate in the project

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,440
uh state of the edge collaborate help

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,039
this is a community driven

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,799
thing right so it's all you know

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,280
volunteers and we are all

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,400
collectively trying to solve some of the

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,480
hardest problems

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,160
that are not differentiating okay nobody

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,320
gets more money by

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,080
calling it far edge thin edge thick edge

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,080
compute you know this

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,080
we all benefit if we standardize on

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,679
vocabulary we all benefit if we kind of

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,200
focus on the plumbing

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,039
so thank you for your leadership and

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,000
thank you very much oh great pleasure

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,640
thank you thank you for having us

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,760
it's a pleasure thanks servant all right

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,960
very good

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,640
okay so this was excellent and now we

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,600
have a

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,760
very exciting presentation as i

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,360
mentioned in my opening keynote uh

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,440
on on wednesday the

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,360
industry the telecommunication industry

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,960
the cloud the iot

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,400
edge all of these uh frameworks have

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,400
moved to open source

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,799
5g is a big enabler edge is a big

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,039
enabler and i think what has happened is

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,000
this plumbing layer if you may for a

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,080
lack of better word this

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,120
non-differentiated life cycle management

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,480
layer with 5g has really

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,559
opened up multiple vertical industries

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
and all of a sudden these industries can

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,559
take advantage of

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,960
5g they can take advantage of the open

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,760
source software and they can really

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,080
benefit from the simplification

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,480
standardization

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,440
and all the innovation that has happened

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,840
below

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,000
so one such industry is obviously you

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,919
know the the broadcast industry

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,600
and uh you know who better to represent

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,679
uh this whole uh concept and and give us

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,799
all the requirements then uh

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,159
uh madeline nolan who's the president of

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,679
atsc systems

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,480
and uh she has great insights into

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,400
what we as a community you know of geeks

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,000
in the networking and edge and software

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,880
space should be doing

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,159
uh to meet requirements that that

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,640
frankly are

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,760
have never been met in in an open manner

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,559
so far so

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
without any delay uh madeline please

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:35,840
welcome and

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,840
and take it on

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,360
thank you very much um so it's such a

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,280
pleasure to be here

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,720
um as our pete mentioned uh what's

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,159
happening in the open source community

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,120
is certainly attracting some new

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,159
verticals

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,000
and at the same time the television

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,559
industry or the television broadcast

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,440
industry

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,880
is launching a new standard which allows

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
the industry to

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,679
begin participating in this sort of

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,880
heterogeneous network ecosystem that is

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,200
developing

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,880
in the in the world today so what i'd

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,799
like to do is kind of give you a quick

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,400
introduction to this new technology

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,080
called atsc

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,840
3.0 it does have a better

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,400
consumer-facing name for the television

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,120
services it's also called next gen tv

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,480
but atsc 3.0 is the broad standard that

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,039
enables much more than just

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,880
television using this wireless data

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,400
delivery network which we know as the

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,080
television airwaves

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
so there's a lot of information in this

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,039
slide deck and i've only got my short 15

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,720
minutes or less

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,080
so it's going to be a little bit of a

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,080
whirlwind for you

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,080
but believe me the fire hose is going

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,480
both ways as the television industry

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,799
experts are learning more and more about

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,880
open source and core network concepts

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,320
and hopefully we are going to give you a

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
little bit of a fire hose treatment in

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,880
terms of what's going on

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
in the broadcast industry

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,159
so we'll give you a quick introduction

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,480
to atsc 3.0 or next gen tv

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,600
a quick understanding of what's going on

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,400
with the deployment

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,880
in the u.s as well as in non-us regions

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,000
and

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,440
also about atsc 3.0 as a platform

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,600
and finally i'm going to be talking

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,280
about core network for broadcast which

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
is a new concept in the broadcast

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
industry but certainly a well-known

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
concept for

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,200
everybody on this call

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,280
so a little bit about atsc we are our

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,600
standards development organization we

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,760
have roughly 140 members that really

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,919
represent the entire ecosystem

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,159
of the broadcast industry from the

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,240
consumer electronics manufacturers like

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,520
sony lg samsung and the other names you

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,559
know well

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,720
as well as the broadcasters and cabc and

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,440
many many equipment and solution vendors

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,440
as well

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,960
and we're also seeing members coming in

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,039
from the telecom industry

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,000
we have qualcomm and sk telecom and a

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,360
few others

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,760
that are sort of bringing that sort of

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,679
expertise into apsc

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,440
amazon web services hewitt packard

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,200
enterprise are all

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,080
newer members that are getting involved

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,080
in the system today

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,720
so atsc 1.0 is today's over-the-air

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,640
television standard

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,559
and those of you who remember rabbit

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,000
ears and all of that this is free

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,000
over-the-air television

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,919
but what it really represents is an

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,280
infrastructure that is nationwide in

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,679
fact worldwide

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,480
of high power high tower highly

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,159
resilient

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,200
systems that deliver data to homes

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,760
and atsc 1.0 was designed for television

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,919
and it was designed for fixed reception

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,679
on high rooftop antennas

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,360
and thinking about what that was like

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,159
well that was back when we had windows

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,679
3.1

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,440
we had 12.2 kilobits per second in our

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,360
modems which was great right

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,440
we had analog cell phones which i think

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,600
he needed a crane to carry around

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,760
and we had vcr tapes and we had atsc 1.0

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,360
so as you can imagine it is time for an

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,039
upgrade

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,840
um atsc 3.0 is a major upgrade over atsc

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,320
1.0

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,240
first of all the physical layer is more

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,159
flexible more configurable

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,159
and it's currently the world's most

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,520
efficient one-to-many transmission

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,760
system

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,360
it gets closer to the shannon limit than

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,159
any system out there today for

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,880
one-to-many

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,840
distribution the transport is now

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,240
ip-based

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,880
and that may sound like well of course

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,120
it is but

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,640
in the past uh television transmission

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,520
systems have been based on

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,440
mpeg2 transport system this is the first

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,279
television delivery system that is based

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,039
on internet protocol

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,559
of course we have to have better tv

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,520
better video better audio better

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,240
applications

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,320
accessibility and advanced emergency

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,679
messaging is always a key core part of

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,159
broadcasters

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,600
service to their communities but we're

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,440
able to do for the first time

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
in a much more efficient manner data

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,720
casting in other words if we're

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,320
delivering ip data

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,919
data packets what difference does it

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,720
make whether those are streaming video

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,679
and audio

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
or something else map updates software

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,880
updates

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,679
who knows what digital signage smart

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,720
agriculture

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,360
connected cars all kinds of things for

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
the future and one of the more important

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,640
things that the architects

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,000
designed into this system is that it is

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
convergence ready

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,520
so the atsc designers imagined a

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,240
heterogeneous

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,559
network system where different data will

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
be

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,559
provided using the sessions on the best

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,960
network for the best purpose

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,159
so it's actually designed to be easily

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,240
interoperable with

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,440
other ip data delivery networks which

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,640
could be wi-fi

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,640
or bluetooth or you know the internet

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,640
lte 5g etc

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,600
so data casting as a service is actually

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,000
one of the big

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,799
benefits to broadcasters for this new

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,760
system

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,720
so atsc 3.0 is a large digital data

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,919
delivery pipe

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,159
wireless there's new single frequency

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,320
network capabilities which enables

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,000
either better reception or more capacity

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,679
or some combination

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
and what it allows is terrestrial

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,120
broadcasters can start

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,400
working or competing with other data

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,400
delivery networks

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,080
in the sort of data delivery commodity

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,200
market if you will

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,320
and it's mostly suited for cases where

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
there's a one-to-many

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,000
use case so in other words where many

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,440
many devices need to get the same

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,200
data so atsc 3.0

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,200
it's not just about television anymore

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,039
a little bit about the deployment what's

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,000
happening in the united states right now

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,240
is that television broadcasters in 62 of

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,080
the 200 odd television markets

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,760
have announced that they will transition

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,919
to atsc 3.0

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,240
and this is a voluntary transition the

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,000
transition from analog to digital was a

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,279
mandatory transition but this one's

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,440
voluntary

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,120
what's exciting about these 62 markets

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,159
is that it may seem like a smaller piece

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,279
of the 210

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,440
all in however it includes the top 40

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,440
of the markets in the country so when we

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,320
get those 62 markets launched

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,279
we will be reaching roughly 75 of u.s

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,039
households

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,440
what you can see here is the progress of

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,760
this launch right now we're at about 25

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,880
of us households with roughly 100

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,360
television stations

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,360
on the air with atsc 3.0 services

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,039
also what's happening in the device

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,400
market again focusing on television for

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,320
the moment

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,080
the consumer technology association

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,279
released some statistics and some

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,559
research about their

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,279
expectation for the uptake and sales of

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,720
next-gen capable television sets because

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,480
honestly the broadcasters aren't going

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,840
to launch this new system which enables

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,440
all these data casting

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,200
if we can't do television and we can't

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,080
do television if people don't have tvs

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,000
that do it

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,240
but they're looking at hopefully having

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,240
roughly 24 million television sets in

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,320
the marketplace by 2024

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,000
that have this capability and more

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,520
recent research suggests that these

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,799
numbers are probably going to be are

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,000
probably too conservative

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,320
we think we're going to beat these

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
numbers by quite a bit

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,600
and in addition to televisions we have

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,360
some set top boxes that are out there

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,559
the zapper box and the hd home run

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,159
connect

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,159
as well as chipsets that are coming on

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,320
the market for mediatek and more

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,080
and low-cost converter boxes are also

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,679
being explored for those consumers that

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
don't want to buy a new set-top box and

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,960
they don't want to buy a new tv they

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,200
want their old tv to connect

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,320
and a low-cost converter box can be a

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,840
solution

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,360
and this device market is going to

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,039
inspire the broadcasters

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,320
to um beyond those 62 markets to get on

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,360
get on the bandwagon there's also a lot

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,640
of international interest in atsc3

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,960
south korea actually launched the

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
service in 2017 and they are currently

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,720
reaching roughly 75 percent of

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,679
households in that country

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,520
canada is exploring atsc3 humber college

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,200
in toronto is developing plans the

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,240
communications research center

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,240
in ottawa is participating heavily and

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,279
the north american broadcast association

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
is also

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,480
forming working groups around this

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,039
technology the

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,600
brazil uh sbtv forum that's their sdo

00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,600
is evaluating atsc 3.0 along with other

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,799
proposals for their tv 3.0 transition

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,279
and in india tsdsi their telecom

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,840
is studying atsc3 and other technologies

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,440
for broadcast traffic offload scenarios

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,480
and direct to mobile services

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
and there are a number of other

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,000
countries that have reached out and atsc

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,840
is kind of organizing itself to

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,679
respond to that outreach as well as

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,799
getting the standard documented in the

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,799
itu-r documents

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,679
atsc3 is a platform which is different

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,360
from atsc one with atsc one

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,880
we came up with the standard we spent a

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,640
lot of money we deployed the standard

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,480
and then we did nothing

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,399
to advance the standard more or less for

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,640
about 20 years that is not going to be

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,480
the case with 3.0 we don't have the

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,000
luxury to deploy something and sit on it

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,320
for 20 years anymore

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
we have to be able to move quickly just

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,120
as others in this pla

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,039
others in this session are going to be

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,080
describing

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,240
so atsc is maintaining this platform and

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,520
uh we're excited about moving forward

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,440
and one of our big

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,039
new initiatives right now is a core

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,559
network for broadcast which i'll get

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,279
into in a minute

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,799
and as i mentioned atsc is envisioning

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,440
convergence

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,880
where it's a 5g ready sort of convergent

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,279
system so you can imagine

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,039
the concept of network slicing where the

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,159
broadcast transport system

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,760
is part of that ecosystem and

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,240
it was designed so that it has many

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,000
common components with the 5g system

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,080
not only at the physical layer in terms

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,919
of the frame numerology but also the ip

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,960
transport and the w3c based

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,919
technologies etc so atsc

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,880
3 can deliver audio video data mobile to

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,039
fixed in

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,200
mobile terminals and large geographic

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,360
areas one-to-many communications

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,720
large number of terminals simultaneously

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,720
in other words point-to-many point

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,320
but the broadcast system has

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,720
traditionally worked where each

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,279
broadcaster controls its own tower

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,039
and nodes don't make a network so we got

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,720
all excited in june 23rd

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,399
june 23rd of last year we launched

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,080
nashville we got two sticks on the air

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,279
12 megahertz altogether

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,200
but that is not a network of course

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,480
so all of you know the core network

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,159
functions pretty well

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,159
and in order to explain to the

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,559
broadcasters i try to use the cell

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,840
cell phone network as the example of

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,360
what we're trying to do

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,480
and i know people are familiar with this

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,279
already so i'm going to skip over this

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,159
so why a core network for broadcast well

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,960
atsc3 enables a nationwide wireless ip

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,080
data

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,799
data delivery network right well

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,399
actually

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,279
since the broadcast towers operate

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,440
within two and one of 210 market areas

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,440
we in fact have we do not have a

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,440
nationwide data delivery network we have

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,600
210 little ones

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,600
so core networks are there to coordinate

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,960
the data transmission among multiple

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,039
transmission towers

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
and broadcasters can work together to

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,480
form one or more

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,159
regional or national broadcast networks

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,399
basically becoming broadcast

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,200
network operators if you will so when

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,679
you combine atsc 3.0 as a standard

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,679
with a core network now we have a

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,600
nationwide wireless ip data delivery

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,799
network

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,399
so as you can imagine the broadcasters

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,919
are excited about this concept

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,600
that would allow them to offer data

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,880
delivery services to national and

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,960
regional customers

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,960
broadcast traffic offload scenarios to

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,200
two-way network operators

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,000
backhaul services between towers and

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,760
much more

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,080
so the functions are pretty much the

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,080
same

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,159
so even when we get all of our nodes

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
launched we still don't really have a

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,360
network

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,320
what we really need is this kind of

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,720
scenario

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,320
where we've got many many nodes launched

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,480
and they're all connected by

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,320
a core network backbone that allows us

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,320
to operate in these spaces

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,960
so one scenario is this concept of

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,159
traffic offload so tsdsi is exploring

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,480
traffic offload for

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,399
india because they have 1.2 billion cell

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,000
phones and a lot of people don't have

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,159
televisions in fact many many

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,799
many people watch television on their

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,039
phones linear television

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,240
and so people watch this linear

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,840
television on their phone

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,000
and the cell phone ownership and data

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,840
usage is continually rising

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,519
so the concept is that when a lot of

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,480
people are watching the same content at

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,360
the same time

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,039
you could shift that content from the

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
cellular network to the broadcast

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,440
network

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,279
and the goal would be to improve the

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,200
cellular network performance by moving

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,200
some of the traffic onto the broadcast

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,039
network

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,360
so india operators are experimenting

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,120
with the 3gpp broadcast mode

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,799
i think it's embms is what they have

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,600
right now i understand

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:38,480
fembms is also available and they're

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,559
also exploring atsc 3.0

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,360
so we'll see what comes of that but it's

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,360
pretty exciting

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,760
so atsc is actually standardizing a core

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,240
network for broadcast it's probably

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,760
going to look a lot like an fpm bms core

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,799
network where you have the concept of

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,200
sim card list

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,640
reception in other words we might have a

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,720
downlink only

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,559
and uh what we have done is we've just

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,960
formed a new technical work group

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,799
called tg3 s43 because we don't know how

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,480
to name stuff that's what we name things

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,079
and they're just in the early stages of

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,919
the work and what's exciting is that

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,800
they're very interested in open source

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,000
solutions

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,919
and they're very interested in the

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,800
virtual network function architecture

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,599
that's being

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,280
that was designed for 5g so we're just

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,119
getting in on the ground floor of this

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,280
and we are looking you know to have

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,200
experts come into the television

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,720
groups to help teach the television

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,760
folks about all these great and

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,760
interesting new concepts

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,760
in summary dtt broadcasters in other

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,119
words

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,440
digital television terrestrial

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,200
broadcasters are operating in a global

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,960
ecosystem of converging networks whether

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,720
they admit it or not

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,520
data sessions steering switching and

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,919
sharing like aka the apss document

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,679
across

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,119
heterogeneous networks can improve the

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,639
spectrum usage

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,399
so we can use the most appropriate

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,919
network for each given use case in a

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,480
dynamic fashion

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,720
an atsc 3 currently is the most

00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,160
efficient one-to-many data delivery

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,720
system in the world today

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,079
designed for tv and non-tv uses and for

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,079
fixed and mobile usage

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,839
one-to-many downlink and designed for

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,960
convergence with other data delivery

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,960
networks

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,119
and a core network for broadcast enables

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,480
broadcasters to efficiently participate

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,680
in the global converged network

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,680
ecosystem so tg3 s43

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,280
has been formed and they're expected to

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,079
explore open source solutions and

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,160
architectures

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,560
for the new broadcast core that's being

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,560
developed

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,240
all right thank you thank you madeline

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,440
that was

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,720
very informative and i i'm i'm so

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,720
so excited about this uh the interesting

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,359
thing that i picked up was

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,880
uh that the television industry has come

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,920
a long way

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,800
you know since the early days and

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,880
convergence is the key word in fact not

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,320
trying to reinvent technologies

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,680
standards and or code

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,440
to just satisfy um you know the

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,320
broadcast industry but to

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,240
utilize what you know the rest of the

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,880
ecosystem has done so i think that

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,440
that one is very encouraging uh for the

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,359
for the

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,040
for the people again if you have

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,240
questions there's a q a button on the

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,960
top you know these

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,640
feel free to uh ask questions uh there

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,800
are a few that are coming in

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,560
um you know the first one i would

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,680
probably like to ask

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,560
is um you know as

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,000
as an end user uh vertical industry

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,040
right i mean we heard from the

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,760
us government yesterday dod we've heard

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,760
from several

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,599
end users telcos we've heard from the

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,800
cloud ecosystem you've heard from you

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,640
know gaming and

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,079
other edge vertical markets

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,359
manufacturing etc

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,040
so as an end user um you know and

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,640
and we are excited that this working

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,079
group has been formed

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,200
uh what would you uh you know what would

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,320
you request

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,440
the op i mean people on the call are 5g

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,440
experts i mean they

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,839
a lot of them work on a project called

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,880
onap which does 5g network slicing they

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,599
work on oran

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,960
sc which does kind of the open ran on

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:12,079
the 5g side they work on edge etc

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,040
what would you sort of say uh as

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,000
as a call to action in terms of helping

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,440
out

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,359
you know because these are standard

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,839
activities and i'm assuming

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,880
once standards are formed you would push

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,280
them down to

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,880
uh the open community to upstream and

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,400
open source and code it

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,160
so that it meets the requirement i'm

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,119
assuming we're just following that

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,040
simple model

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,359
and you know we're not going to develop

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,079
code just for the television industry

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,839
would is that a correct assumption

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,000
yes and and so thinking about the

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,800
question what is the call to action

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,720
atsc is in the same uh has the same

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,599
attitude as what you just described

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,440
we do not want to reinvent the wheel um

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,119
television broadcasters are new to the

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,280
core network concepts

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,160
and the core network concepts are so

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,680
well developed

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,800
in um in this 5g 4g cellular world

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,079
and ideally we don't write very much new

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,200
standard um so the best thing that uh

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,760
could be helpful

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,040
and move the ecosystem forward would be

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,320
to ensure

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,640
that atsc is using what exists

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,640
so that uh new so so we don't start from

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,440
scratch which would be of course silly

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,400
but uh you know among the television

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,240
engineers

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,520
we have a tremendous number of really

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,359
really smart people

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,720
but there is a bit of a learning curve

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,280
so to ensure

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,800
that these engineers understand what

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,560
exists today

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,800
how it can apply to the television

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,520
broadcast system so that we can clearly

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,760
delineate

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,200
any gap analysis even if there is any

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,640
you know potentially

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,480
the whole thing could be a recommended

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,960
practice that explains how to use

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,640
the concepts described in 3gpp standards

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,839
and apply them to the television core

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,760
that's possible

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,599
but what we need to do is we need to

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,400
really completely understand what's

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,960
available

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,680
so we don't reinvent things that already

00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,359
exist

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,680
and to the extent that folks are

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,280
interested in participating in apsc

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,599
either as members or as guest

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,119
presenters that would be tremendously

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,480
helpful to the system

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,079
so that we can be sure that we're

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,800
working on something that's very well

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,480
aligned

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,720
with what this community is interested

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,359
in working with awesome

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,440
and uh there are a few more questions uh

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,440
i'm sure one of

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,440
this this question may have created

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,800
maybe a you a new use case for you or

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
you may have already thought about it

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,160
but

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,920
uh someone's asked uh you know could one

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,440
application of atsc be

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:37,040
to broadcast uh firmware updates to

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,000
iot devices in the field uh so that

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,920
uh you know you know you could probably

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,640
have a network of iot devices right

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,599
there

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,640
and or and and if so you know would each

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,119
iot device

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,760
need its own atsc receiver like an ott

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,040
box

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,520
or is that just a software with a hub

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,160
but in general have you thought about

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,160
generally

00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,359
you know the the billions of connected

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,079
devices that will

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,839
exist in the field from an edge

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,400
perspective

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,599
yes definitely um uh firmware and

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,640
software updates

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,800
uh would definitely be something on the

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,480
on the radar as well as for example

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,160
large map updates that might be going to

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,440
car navigation systems

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,119
these are the kinds of things that are

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,920
perfectly suited to the one-to-many

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,839
system

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,319
uh we in fact we're having conversations

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,560
with a major social platform

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,359
social media platform that is updating

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,240
their app

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,240
on phones and currently they pay for

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,560
data to be sent over some network uh

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,680
whether it be a cdn wi-fi network or or

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,200
what have you

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,319
um and uh they're thinking that

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,200
well if the broadcasters are planning to

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,560
compete in sort of a commodity market of

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,400
data delivery

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,480
can they save us money by us using their

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,720
network to deliver these this data

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,880
rather than another network and the

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,319
answer is the broadcasters think so

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,079
um they think that they're going to have

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,880
a great price because it's a one-to-many

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,920
system

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,440
and they think that they're going to

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,160
have a great service level because the

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,920
system

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,599
the the broadcast television system is

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,520
extremely resilient

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,800
i mean this is this is the emergency

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,720
messaging community

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,920
and when hurricanes hit television

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,319
stations are up

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,359
um so it's extremely resilient high

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,200
service level

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,400
but the question is how is that business

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,079
math going to turn out

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,119
because you're right you do have to have

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,880
an atsc 3.0 tuner in the device

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,560
so how much does it cost to put that

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,880
tuner in the device versus how much can

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,160
i save and data delivery costs

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,839
and you know the answer is tva you could

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,680
also envision though that if some of

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,760
these devices are in the home

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,280
that you could have one atsc tuner

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,440
receiver in the home which could act as

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,119
an atsc3 hotspot

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,880
and then it could deliver ip packets

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,480
over the home network so that's another

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,280
possibility for some of these iot

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,880
devices

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,720
but for those kinds of devices that are

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,599
on the move like cars and cell phones

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,400
and other

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,800
mobile devices then um thinking about

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,079
having the tuner in the device itself

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,400
is probably something that's worth

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,680
considering beautiful

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,880
that's a great great wrap but again

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,839
i really want to thank madeline uh for

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,319
for for providing these insights i think

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,240
the

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,880
open source community is really excited

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,359
of uh you know of helping out

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,960
the atsc and the broadcast industry so

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,560
thank you very much for taking the time

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,640
to talk to us

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,319
well thank you and everyone is invited

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,720
uh this is kind of a green field right

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,119
now

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,400
so it's a great time to get in on this

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,560
project and

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,760
we welcome anyone who would like to be

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,000
involved or has questions

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:41,040
thank you thank you all right

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,520
and the next speaker is is one of the

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,560
very

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,599
active participants in the open source

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,880
world

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:53,200
he's the ceo of a startup called arna

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,200
networks here in the bay area and

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,359
you know he's going to talk about an

00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,240
interesting concept on

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,359
you know how open source gets pulled

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,520
together

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,880
and you know how do we look at it from

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,359
an end to end perspective because

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,079
remember

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,680
you know disaggregation will require

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,560
re-aggregation and integration at the

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,040
end so

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,040
uh please welcome amar kapadia

00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:22,209
[Music]

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,560
thanks our pith for that introduction hi

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,800
everyone

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,960
uh let me just give a quick introduction

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,079
on arna networks rna networks is a

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,839
startup

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,920
and we are creating an open source

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,880
platform for orchestration

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,560
management and closed loop automation of

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,520
5g networks

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,560
and edge computing application the end

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,000
is important

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,000
we believe there is going to be one

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,240
unified edge

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,839
and therefore you need one unified

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,839
management solution

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,200
so let's talk about the problem that we

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,119
are solving

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,640
with 5g and edge computing something

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,800
interesting happens

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,480
everything becomes a piece of software

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,440
other than the radio

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,400
everything is software what that does is

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,599
that the stress

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,079
on network service or composite

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,839
application management explodes by about

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,319
a million x

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,720
and what does that really mean so assume

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,119
you have a thousand ed sites

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,040
and assume you have 200 applications

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,960
that when combined with

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,680
network slicing go up to a thousand

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,160
application instances

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,000
so and assume that you are running all

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,880
of this on kubernetes

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,319
edge core and public clouds so on the

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,040
orchestration

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,720
now if you're trying to do it the with

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,800
the current methodology

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,800
you'll have a million helm charts that

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,960
you'll have to modify

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,200
you'll have to log into a thousand

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,640
kubernetes master nodes

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,839
and run a few million cube ctl commands

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,000
clearly nobody is going to do this

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,280
when it comes to life cycle management

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,079
something similar

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,720
you will have to connect to a million

00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,920
application

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,520
endpoints whether it's gui or

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,119
apis because typically applications

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,960
and their management systems have a

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,000
one-to-one relationship

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,040
or you'll be running a bunch of ansible

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,359
scripts

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,319
a million times again this is just

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,359
simply nobody

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,599
is going to do that that's not feasible

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,839
when it comes to service assurance to

00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,079
solve

00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,359
again you'll have to connect to a

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,960
million

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,960
management endpoints you'll be looking

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,839
at million dashboards

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,400
and human beings will be solving

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,440
problems

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,720
based on tickets being opened again just

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,720
simply not viable so that's the problem

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,520
that we are attempting to solve it's an

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,680
ambitious problem

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,040
fortunately we have a lot of help from

00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,240
open source

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,880
so the solution is we are going we are

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,160
using

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,200
linux foundation's own app project

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,079
for intent based orchestration

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,560
lifecycle management and real-time

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,480
policy-driven closed-loop automation

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,760
of 5g network services and edge

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,520
computing applications

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,200
let me explain what all of that means

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,800
that's a lot of

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,359
jargon thrown in so what you see in this

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,160
diagram on the left is at the bottom you

00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,040
have

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,359
the cloud or technically you can call it

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,319
the

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,440
nfvi network function virtualization

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,440
infrastructure

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,640
so that's going to be industry standard

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,960
hardware

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,800
with kubernetes on top and maybe

00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,599
platform services like database as a

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,720
service

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,880
etc so you have these

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,280
on top of that you have the applications

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,359
applications could be of different types

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,480
they could be cloud native network

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,520
functions 5g

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,560
core 5g ram virtual firewall

00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,800
sd-wan so on and so forth they could be

00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,079
arbitrary cloud native applications

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,359
drone control robot control 360 video

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,079
etc

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,680
analytics video surveillance radiology

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,000
anamoly detection

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,200
and platform services like edgex foundry

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,720
amazon greengrass azure iot edge

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,960
so what this uh management solution

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,559
does is it step zero it registers all

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,359
the kubernetes clusters

00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,119
whether you have one ten thousand ten

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:30,400
thousand

00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,880
then it onboards the applications

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,720
then the user can the designer can

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,079
create network services

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,200
or composite applications and then

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,119
do intent based orchestration uh with

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,160
day zero configuration so it's all this

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,720
is all zero touch

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,319
completely automated once the initial

00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,760
orchestration happens

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:53,599
the day one day two life cycle

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,559
management

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,520
configuration is automated through the

00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,319
system

00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,319
and after that the management system

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,760
monitors these applications

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,240
for fault management performance

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,160
management etc and then

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,160
makes corrections automatically by

00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,280
running all that telemetry through

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,000
a big data or an aiml pipeline without

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,040
involving

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,559
human beings and that practice is called

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,559
real-time policy-driven

00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,200
closed-loop automation or control loop

00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,520
automation you'll hear both words

00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,440
so that's the solution uh we're building

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,240
we're taking some components from onap

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,079
we're taking a particular component from

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,000
intel's openness

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,920
and packaging it all together we will

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,960
add value on top in terms of network

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,480
slicing

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,240
non-real-time rig for oran nwdaf

00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,240
which stands for network data analytics

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,240
functions for the 5g core

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,880
in terms of our open source

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,040
participation for 2021

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,400
we are involved in onap in a variety of

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,760
activities

00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,319
uh linux foundation networking demos

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,559
and linux foundation edge akraino i'm

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:06,400
going to spend the rest of

00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,359
the time on a very interesting and new

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,559
development

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,960
the end-to-end 5g super blueprint we are

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,839
actively involved with that as arpath

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,280
mentioned

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:19,760
and i'm personally just super excited

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,760
about that

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,240
so what is the end to end 5g super

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,800
blueprint

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,520
there was realization in the community

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,920
that all the ingredients required for an

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,280
end to end 5g blueprint already exists

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,040
they're already there

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:40,480
in linux foundation and there are also

00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,680
some existing blueprints or demos

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,000
that are doing parts of this so why not

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,280
just

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,559
combine all of this and create a super

00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,119
blueprint

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,480
as it may and solve this problem

00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,280
holistically

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,319
so you have what i'll show you in the

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,720
next few slides

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,400
what components we are taking from all

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,839
these projects and

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,839
how are we leveraging existing demos my

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,599
personal prediction is that this new

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,160
blueprint is going to democratize

00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,319
and dominate 5g i think you will see it

00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,839
in production

00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:18,319
maybe second half or definitely in 2022

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:20,319
and what's interesting is this is not

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,800
just an open source software project

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,839
it's an open source solution project

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,079
using production ready open source

00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,400
software

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,079
so let's uh let's dive into that a

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,160
little bit more

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:37,200
so this blueprint has three stages

00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,319
stage one is going to be q2 of this here

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,720
then q3 of this here and then q4 in the

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,280
first stage we are going to

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,800
show 5g core with edge computing

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,079
applications

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:54,160
in the next stage we will do n to n5g

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:56,400
and then finally we'll do 5g with oran

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,960
and in the middle phase we will also do

00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,480
end to end network slicing

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,520
so i'll show you the components in the

00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,720
next few slides the value is obviously

00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,240
fully disaggregated open source 5g with

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,000
edge computing

00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,079
and in the last stage we will also show

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,680
oran the use cases

00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:18,880
are 5g fixed wireless access private 5g

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,000
edge computing iot and ultimately

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,559
full public 5g networks including voice

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,559
services

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,319
so this is what the first phase will

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,119
look like on the top right we will have

00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,240
onap

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,720
and an openness component running

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,119
on kubernetes which will come from the

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:43,119
anukit project

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,359
that is going to onboard and orchestrate

00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,960
the magma project that's a recent

00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,640
development in case you haven't followed

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,760
it the facebook magma project

00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,559
is now part of the linux foundation

00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,280
in addition to that the onap and

00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,359
openness combination will onboard and

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,280
orchestrate edge computing applications

00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,040
that come from the ukraine or one of the

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,520
cranial blueprints

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,839
magma will run on a new kit kubernetes

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,960
reference implementation as well along

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,680
with a variety of

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,200
additional linux foundation projects for

00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,160
sdn controller

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,599
for virtual switching storage data plane

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,280
acceleration

00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:26,640
etc now in this phase we will use

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,440
a g node b and a ue emulator to show the

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,720
system

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,119
so that's going to be the first stage

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,200
the next stage looks very similar except

00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,800
that we will replace the emulators

00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:41,200
with a commercial g node b and that

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,720
will be with that we'll be able to show

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,839
an end-to-end

00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,839
uh 5g and edge computing system

00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:55,200
even though with a commercial ran

00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,119
we will not be orchestrating it but

00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,119
we will definitely be managing it

00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,920
because we the combination of

00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,040
app and openness can definitely manage

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,400
pnfs

00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,960
at the same degree as vnf's or

00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,960
cnfs

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:16,640
and in the last stage we are going to

00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,720
replace the commercial ram with oran sc

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,359
which stands for oran software community

00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:24,559
software and with that we will have

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:28,000
the ru the du the cu

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:30,640
and near real-time rick all managed by

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,559
onap and in this case onap will take the

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,960
role of an smo

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,160
the oran smo service management and

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,119
orchestration

00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,680
and we'll talk to oran over interfaces

00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,880
such as

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,640
o1 and a1 for complete

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,480
fault management performance management

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,000
configuration management

00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,400
and communicating with the near

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,160
real-time break

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,319
so hopefully that gives you a good

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,720
flavor of

00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:59,280
what we are doing as a company and this

00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,160
new brand new 5g

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,400
super blueprint and i would invite

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,559
everyone to join this blueprint it is

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,720
like i mentioned open source the more

00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:12,240
people we have the faster we can execute

00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,240
and the richer the blueprint can be

00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:19,599
thanks serpent all right

00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,720
excellent thanks amar that's very

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,720
very informative again

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,240
if there's questions please feel free to

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,000
put them in the q a on the

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,079
on the top right uh there are a few

00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,960
coming in uh

00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,000
in terms of uh you know collaboration

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,119
and things like that

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,520
where where are you expecting you know

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,480
your and other similar companies from

00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,720
your perspective

00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,520
where are you expecting this work stream

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,480
or or

00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,760
or is it part of lfn lfege i mean

00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,640
there's there's a lot of linux

00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,720
foundation and

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,799
and even outside linux foundation i mean

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,640
we're this is not

00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:56,880
this is just not like a bookended

00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,680
solution right this is kind of an open

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,559
source based uh end to end uh stack if

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,520
you may

00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,920
um where would people come in i mean is

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,599
it

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,640
uh part of any release is it part of any

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,240
work stream demos you know what

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,079
where where are you thinking of

00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,200
contributing this

00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,400
so the uh there's a in linux foundation

00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,480
networking

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,160
there is already an existing cloud

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,119
native 5g demo

00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,880
so it's part of the demo project so that

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,520
project will be expanded

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,040
to now handle the this 5g super

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,760
blueprint as well

00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,119
and what you see is you see a very

00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,280
interesting

00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,160
set of contributors that will come

00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,400
together

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,839
so people like us will come together

00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,520
from the management side

00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,680
you will have companies that will come

00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,960
together there's a variety of

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,839
magma contributors who are going to work

00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,160
on this from

00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,040
sort of the 5g core point of view you

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,880
will have

00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,880
people joining from anukit who will

00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,520
bring the nfvi perspective

00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,040
and i think that to me shows the power

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,599
of open source

00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,559
where you can have people with diverse

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,799
skills

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,319
come together which no single company

00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,599
can do companies tend to be more

00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,760
homogeneous

00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,040
and here we'll have experts all the way

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,799
from management side

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,079
down to the hardware and people thinking

00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,280
about sriov

00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,960
and and dpdk so that's how we'll

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,119
be doing it it'll be completely open

00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,480
governance i mean it's linux foundation

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,559
i don't have to say it

00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,000
but it'll be completely transparent open

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,319
with open governance

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,599
so anybody is free to join and and start

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,960
helping

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,920
all right uh there's a few more

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,040
questions uh some on the dates that you

00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,119
had proposed i think

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,480
you may have gone through very quickly

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,480
uh

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,079
so that's kind of on the dates and i

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,960
think the other question was

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,000
uh in the third stage you know you said

00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,799
commercial iran

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,559
and oran i mean that that you

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,000
specifically meant the software portion

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,000
of it because there's still

00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,839
the the commercial rand vendors who

00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,280
support iran right so i think just

00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,799
clarification on those two please that's

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,920
a good clarification sorry yeah i

00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,960
misspoke yeah

00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,280
yeah and the dates would be uh phase one

00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,920
is

00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,599
you you're thinking q q two q three q

00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,280
four so every quarter type

00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:15,599
like any any other okay very good um

00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,400
thank you very much i think we may be

00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,440
able to take

00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,079
one more one more question uh how do you

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,240
see

00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,760
uh you know now that the mech and the

00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,480
cloud come together

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,119
uh how do you see uh you know onap

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,520
driving

00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,280
the enterprise market along with the

00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,559
iran as well uh there was

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,559
a question like that so could you

00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,319
specify on that specifically now that

00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,160
onap is all cloud native right with the

00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:41,040
latest g release

00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,040
yeah and that's a really good

00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,559
observation there's a brand new

00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:50,160
um effort i started a few months ago

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:52,240
uh own app for enterprise and

00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,000
what's been interesting is for us in the

00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,440
community it's always been obvious

00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,000
that there's nothing that ties

00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:04,079
onapp to networking or to

00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,040
telecommunications it's a very flexible

00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,839
and open

00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,480
sort of a platform and i'm glad to see

00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,480
that

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,079
effort that's another initiative it's a

00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,960
parallel initiative to what i just

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,960
mentioned

00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,000
it's in the own app community and that's

00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,280
going to see how

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,280
onap can be used for the enterprise and

00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,680
i'm giving my personal belief at this

00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,440
point my personal belief is that

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,040
there should be no difference between a

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,960
cloud native network function

00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,240
and a cloud native application so

00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,480
whether you are doing

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,040
network services based on cnfs or

00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,720
composite applications based on cnas

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,960
from a management or an owner point of

00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,880
view they should look identical

00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,000
very good and i think that is the power

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,319
of abstraction and standardizing now

00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,359
clearly vnfcns and in the telco world

00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,799
clearly there's a lot more

00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,880
standardization

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,559
uh that and apis that have been

00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,400
standardized right versus

00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,920
in the enterprise world we're still

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,440
getting there uh

00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,119
given that you know it's it's data

00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,640
centers and it's it's still

00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,000
you know proprietary inside the data

00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,960
center especially in the large company

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,040
so anyway

00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,160
great questions and and again thank you

00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,480
for your insights

00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,520
uh again encourage everybody to join and

00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,920
participate

00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:14,319
uh i think there's a lot of community uh

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,040
interest on on this as well because

00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,960
i think you heard from several end users

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,480
right i think madeline talked about it

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,839
just recently on you know how can they

00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,280
pull it all together

00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:27,040
uh yesterday the uh dod and jms talked

00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,160
about how they can use

00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,960
you know something at this level uh

00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,520
clearly you know we have huge huge

00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,200
interest

00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,799
in making this happen so thank you for

00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,920
leading this effort damar uh

00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,920
thanks a lot thanks

00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,920
all right so moving on to the next uh

00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,960
presentation uh

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,319
uh we have the cto of tech mahendra

00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,480
manish mongol

00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:52,079
who has joined us uh as you know tech

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,280
mahindra is kind of one of the

00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:58,640
the leading sis and and uh you know

00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,200
a global player and they have a very

00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,240
broad

00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,319
vision of what's happening everywhere uh

01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,359
and so you know it's our privilege and

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,200
and and

01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:08,559
uh we are very excited to have manish

01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,280
sort of talk about

01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:14,010
what he sees uh that we can all learn

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:22,240
from so please welcome manish manga

01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:26,480
[Music]

01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:29,200
thank you thank you so much

01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,520
for the opportunity it's a it's an honor

01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,599
uh

01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,440
and a privilege you know what what a

01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,720
great three days this have been uh i

01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,240
mean the amount of

01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,480
conversations that we have seen in the

01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,200
last couple of days the the great set of

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,839
presentations it's been just phenomenal

01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,960
i just want to congratulate qrp and the

01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:47,359
entire leadership team

01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,559
at the linux foundation to be playing

01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:51,760
such a critical role

01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,400
in driving this ecosystem and like you

01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,079
said

01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,440
you know we have one of the one of the

01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:59,599
privileges to be

01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,839
a a global player is to be able to have

01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,040
a good visibility as to what's happening

01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:06,000
around the world

01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,400
and being able to help play our pivotal

01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,920
role

01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,720
in making these technology

01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,160
transformations real so i'll start sort

01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,680
of saying is that we bring a bit of a

01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,440
different perspective

01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,079
you know there are so much of the

01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,760
technology that is changing these days

01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:21,119
and that's a fantastic thing for

01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,760
industry uh

01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,520
our purpose in life is to is to really

01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,319
drive the realization of those

01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,640
technologies

01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:29,760
into the real world fields as fast as

01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,480
possible

01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,359
and one of the things that we have been

01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,920
on a mission

01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:38,000
is why traditionally it used to take 12

01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,760
to 18 months for any new technology

01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,319
to get adopted into an operator's

01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,160
network or an enterprise adoption to be

01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:46,400
able to really take advantage of it

01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,839
how do we shorten the cycle how do we

01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,960
get the technologies much

01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,480
faster implemented operationalized into

01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,520
a into a real world

01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:58,160
and really allow the the new way of

01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,039
building operating and optimizing

01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,960
networks

01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,240
so we kind of reinvented ourselves we

01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,000
said that the

01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,520
role of a system integrator from a

01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,359
traditional perspective is really the

01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,640
role of the past

01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,559
things are going to change on a

01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,400
continuous basis the world really needs

01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,400
a continuous integrator

01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,960
that can really help integrate new

01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,799
technology at the faster pace hence

01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,640
you know our vr cells call as a

01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:22,880
continuous integrator

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,400
not a traditional system integrator

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,640
anymore so with that

01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,039
with that insight what i will share with

01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,799
you today my perspective around

01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,119
how we are seeing some of these

01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:35,839
technologies coming together

01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,240
and what it means to really create the

01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:40,240
right environment for them to adopt it

01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,160
so with that said let me first start

01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,240
with the fundamental premise

01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,680
that we are operating under which is

01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,920
really the network

01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,799
and the role of the network has has

01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,720
drastically

01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,240
changed and is changing you know we

01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,599
started with network as a connectivity

01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,240
infrastructure right whether it was a

01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:59,440
voice service or a basic internet access

01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,599
you can relate it to 2g 3g or even 4g

01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,240
technology it was all built around

01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,079
how do i give a connectivity to the user

01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,839
then they kind of evolved

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,920
and said it's not just about the

01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,520
connectivity the network is a platform

01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,000
and more importantly it's an open

01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,760
platform that allows us to do two things

01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,599
disaggregate the functions of the

01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,920
network that makes the

01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,359
operations and the cost of the network

01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,520
better

01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:25,119
at the same time allows the exposure of

01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,680
the network functions to

01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,520
to be driven to the third party

01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,319
applications for them to build it right

01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:34,799
and we saw it a complete transformation

01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:37,760
of the industry as 4g really became a

01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,319
platform and the ubers of the world the

01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,200
the real

01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:42,640
applications uh that really came to use

01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,280
it became completely

01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,000
a phenomenal transformation for all of

01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,839
us

01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,520
but that's great now where we are

01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:51,680
heading is really about

01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:54,000
it's not just about creating a platform

01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,640
but it's also about giving an experience

01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,359
how can network play a much important

01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,200
role

01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,799
in creating the experiences for the end

01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,799
users and i'll share why

01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:04,240
it's relevant but we kind of see that

01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,799
network as an experienced

01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,640
platform now going forward and what that

01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,440
means is that the the network is a

01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,240
distributed

01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:14,319
edge cloud right every application that

01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:17,200
we are seeing is getting cloudified

01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:19,119
what that means is that to maintain the

01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,640
capability of the network to deliver

01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,359
that kind of an experience

01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:25,440
it has to be seen as a cloud and it has

01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,839
to be seen as a distributed cloud that

01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,319
can go all the way to the customer edge

01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:31,680
and can basically drive experiences for

01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,480
the different applications as it's

01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,839
required

01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,079
so to me one thing is very

01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,039
fundamental as we look at how we at tech

01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,599
mahindra

01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,039
look to integrate various technology

01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,200
deliver it for our customers

01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,480
is really with the eye on how it's

01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,799
helping our customers

01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,760
enable the experiences for their

01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,880
customers

01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,240
and that's really a very very key and

01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,599
and why it's key

01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,480
right uh with 5g i think we are we are

01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,640
really

01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,760
stretching the envelope around two

01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,839
dimensions

01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,119
one is around bandwidth another one is

01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,720
around latency

01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,640
right now bandwidth and latency has been

01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,000
known before it's not a new concept i

01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,319
mean we have always

01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,839
had the idea of what it means to deliver

01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,039
the higher speed bandwidth and what's

01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:17,599
the latency required

01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,359
for voice versus data but we are really

01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,960
going micro segmentation now

01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,799
it's not about just voice and data and

01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,760
internet access is just not one

01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,640
service so to speak these services that

01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,960
are going to be used

01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,240
inside the data connectivity just there

01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,240
are plethora

01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,680
of those services and i think what we

01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,240
tried to do and said

01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,079
if we were to really drive the network

01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,240
as an experienced platform

01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,079
it really needs to operate at these two

01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,599
two vectors

01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,079
one is the bandwidth otherwise the

01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,880
latency and the capability of the

01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,039
network

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,559
needs to support variety of the

01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,520
combinations of these

01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,039
uh latency and bandwidth which is really

01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,359
the network slicing comes

01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:59,680
into the picture as a technology right

01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:02,079
but but it has to be very adaptive

01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,280
it has to be very seamless and it has to

01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,920
become very very

01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,760
integral part of how a services

01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,520
templates are created

01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,799
the services templates are provisioned

01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,400
in the network and

01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,960
they are operationalized so that

01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,880
experience of of those

01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,640
services can be delivered and then

01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,000
monitor on a constant basis so that you

01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,599
have a service assurance

01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,280
and have an auto a closed loop

01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,520
automation that allows you to

01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,559
to make corrective and coercive changes

01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,720
as we go along

01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,319
so we recognize that the industry is not

01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,599
about just providing internet access

01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,720
anymore it's really

01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:37,440
about providing a plethora of

01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,119
applications they all demand very unique

01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,559
and very differentiated experiences and

01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,760
that's sort of a background from which

01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,960
we come from

01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,119
right and one very

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,680
critical thing that's happening as part

01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:52,400
of that is

01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:54,319
a movement of the infrastructure itself

01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,680
you know one one critical thing that we

01:06:54,319 --> 01:07:00,079
have uh we hold very tightly is that

01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,359
around 60 of the consumption of the data

01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,440
is moving to the edge

01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,799
which means that if you really want to

01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,839
deliver the experience that we are

01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,400
talking about

01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:10,319
the infrastructure has to move around

01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,280
logically as well closer and closer to

01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,079
the customer

01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,280
and hence the idea the whole idea of uh

01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,799
network edge

01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,160
that we all as an industry have been

01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,839
going and linux foundation is doing a

01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,200
brilliant job in creating open source

01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,839
technologies with it

01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,400
is very very important uh and it has to

01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,400
be implemented

01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:30,480
what what we're looking at from a a

01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,920
manufacturing perspective if i look at

01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,000
just an enterprise

01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,000
marketplace is really to say we're

01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,160
looking at a three-tier architecture

01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,160
there is a device edge that really is

01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,680
controlling all sorts of sensors and the

01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,960
devices that are in the market and this

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,880
could be consumer

01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,400
in the world of consumer and enterprises

01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,400
in the world of enterprises

01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,799
right and there is an enterprise edge

01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,359
and this edge would sit into the network

01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:53,359
or

01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,880
in the prem of the enterprise but this

01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,720
is really where your

01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,240
your application experience your

01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,039
application functionality

01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:02,319
your capability intelligence all of that

01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,319
is being housed

01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:05,599
and then you have a cloud which is

01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,760
really a brain

01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,520
and the and the center from which all of

01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,599
your management happens right

01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,440
so three-tiered architecture is really

01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,520
what's starting to shape up as

01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,120
something that is real something that

01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,719
needs to be operationalized

01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,960
and something that needs to become so

01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,159
seamless that some of the applications

01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,319
may have to be hosted

01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:26,000
all the way to the device edge some of

01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,400
the applications needs to be hosted at

01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,319
the enterprise edge or the network edge

01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,679
or some of the application has to be

01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,719
hosted in the cloud

01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,719
right and this has to be done on an

01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:38,799
application by application basis so that

01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,000
the experience again for them can be

01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,920
managed as it's

01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,679
expected and this is where we kind of

01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,199
come in and say that that sounds like a

01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,520
very complex problem

01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:49,279
there are too many technologies that are

01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,159
attempting to solve some of them are in

01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,880
a niche

01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,759
specific type of areas some are in a

01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,960
broader way

01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:59,040
but what does it take to operationalize

01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,159
something like that is where we kind of

01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,560
come from and say

01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:04,400
it's not just a straightforward uh you

01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,159
know game plan to say let's put just one

01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,839
hardware here one software here

01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:12,640
it's really about a hybrid environment

01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:14,560
right the world today exists a lot of

01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,679
the new container native technologies

01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,319
that we are talking about

01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,440
are not going to be overnight replacing

01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,799
everything else

01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,719
now we started from the world of a

01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:24,799
physical network

01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,159
we are now in a what we call as a sort

01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,759
of a virtualized world

01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:29,839
you can call it semi-custom but it's

01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,839
really a virtualized open network

01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:33,440
where really we have segregated the

01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,719
hardware from the software

01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,560
and now we are moving more into the

01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,759
container container native cloud native

01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,600
networks

01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,640
the thing with with this migration path

01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,480
if you if you may i

01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,920
may say that is this all have to coexist

01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,839
we are not replacing everything

01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,239
overnight and that really is where when

01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,400
i

01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:54,239
talk to our customers globally their

01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,080
number one challenge is

01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:58,320
how do i take this new technology which

01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,920
i totally understand is a great benefit

01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,880
great value proposition

01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,120
but how do i get it inside my network

01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,920
how do i co-exist with what i already

01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,320
have

01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,040
and how do i create a transformation

01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,360
journey

01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:13,280
so that i can start to migrate over my

01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,440
existing capabilities that may not

01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,719
may not give me the functionality that i

01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,880
want like

01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,000
uh the cloud native container native

01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,719
flexibility

01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,159
how do i start moving workloads more and

01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,800
more into the new architecture new

01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:25,840
platform

01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,840
and it has to be done as a

01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,159
transformation journey it's not a

01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,520
a uh you know i turn the switch off once

01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,800
and then turn the switch on on the other

01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,040
one and that's where i think we have

01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,080
been spending a lot of time in our world

01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,920
to give our customers a view to

01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,920
create that roadmap create that

01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,280
transformation plan create that ability

01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,679
to coexist

01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,400
while not impacting the experiences of

01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,880
the customer

01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,560
that absolutely are critical to deliver

01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,159
from all kpi's perspective

01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,480
and hence we created what we call as a

01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,280
network so ti so netapp's for ti from

01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,600
our point of view

01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,280
is really an automation platform which

01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,199
really manages the life cycle of a

01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,760
network from an end-to-end perspective

01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:05,199
right there are multiple layers of the

01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,800
life cycle management there's an

01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,440
infrastructure management that has to

01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,280
happen

01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,280
then there is an experience the customer

01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,239
experience and the services experience

01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,719
that has to happen

01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:16,800
so where we looked at and said we really

01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,000
need customers a point of view

01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,719
in terms of how they can actually

01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,239
create this end-to-end environment for

01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,400
automation and multi-cloud

01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:27,520
orchestration and that's something what

01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,960
you know is what i'm

01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,560
depicting on the slide right now where

01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,440
you where you would see

01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,199
that below you have a bunch of different

01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,120
domains i mean you've got radio networks

01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:39,679
you've got edge networks

01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,600
transport networks core and all of that

01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:43,040
you've got individual domain managers

01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,800
who are very good at managing the

01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:48,080
functionality the performance of those

01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,800
domains but how do i effectively give an

01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,280
operations cockpit a single kind of

01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,520
glass

01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,600
to the customer that allows them to

01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,159
really manage the end-to-end life cycle

01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,520
of an

01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:01,440
of a platform right it can start from a

01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,040
a plan and design and build phase on the

01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,120
left side which we really determine is

01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,800
the cdf functionality it's a continuous

01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,400
process of planning and design it's not

01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,960
a one-time event that happens and goes

01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,400
away

01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,480
so there is a whole module that we have

01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,800
built around on a continuous basis that

01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,320
implements the planning function and in

01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,920
some cases we have actually reduced the

01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,000
planning time by 70

01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,480
by automating a lot of functions inside

01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
that and then you have a orchestration

01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,560
the service orchestration which really

01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,800
says

01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,760
how do i bring in the right software on

01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,440
this network

01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,199
infrastructure could be hybrid

01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,239
infrastructure or any form of a cloud

01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,560
infrastructure

01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:36,239
and that's where it could be a you know

01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,480
a container native

01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:41,120
or it could be open stack or it could be

01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,600
vmware it's sort of a infrastructure

01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,280
underneath

01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,800
it but how do i bring a variety of

01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,800
different software on top of it and

01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,800
manage the life cycle of it

01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,239
in the form of a service orchestration

01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,480
and then the service assurance

01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:53,520
which is most important thing to make

01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,600
sure that

01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,679
whenever i deploy any network functions

01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,760
the performance of that can be managed

01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,840
and especially with the observability

01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,679
framework right where we are looking at

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,440
not just monitoring the network but also

01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,520
observing it how it's doing and course

01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,360
correcting on an automation basis

01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,199
and then and the last function is really

01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,040
about continuous insights

01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:14,960
and intelligence that allows you to

01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,800
operate on a constantly

01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,719
you know ai enabled models to be put on

01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,560
it and you are constantly improving the

01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:22,880
operations of the network

01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,640
what the whole idea is really is to

01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,640
create that single panel class at the

01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,760
end of the day so a customer can look at

01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,679
it and say

01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,520
from an operations team point of view

01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,199
i've got this my existing network with

01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,520
x number of functions sitting on this

01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:38,080
platform i have new network

01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,640
platform that i've installed in one one

01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,560
market

01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,960
or one instances and i'm starting to

01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,600
move the workload from one place to the

01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,600
other and

01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,640
i'm getting a seamless ability to manage

01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,239
my operations

01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,159
from an end-to-end perspective and i do

01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,640
it through the portal so i give sort of

01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,800
a

01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,400
hyperscaler experience in being able to

01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,000
manage the life cycle of the network

01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,440
that's so that's the purpose that's the

01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,480
whole idea and

01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:03,360
and uh this is really

01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:05,199
key from our perspective to achieve the

01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,840
real vision of why we are doing all of

01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,480
this

01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,120
at the end of the day the purpose of all

01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,120
open

01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,640
technologies that we are inventing is to

01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:16,080
be able to give a

01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:18,080
autonomous adaptive auto operations

01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,199
uh for the customers right for all the

01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,840
operators so that

01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,520
for them the ability to maintain manage

01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,640
and operate this network is completely

01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,679
seamless it's

01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:30,480
auto loop it's control loop and auto

01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:32,080
automated and and honestly this is the

01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:35,440
nirvana that we are trying to achieve

01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,080
and our platform of ai nov as we have

01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,560
called it

01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,159
is really given towards that so we have

01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:43,360
combined the netops or ti

01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:45,040
with ai not basically to say netoxi

01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,239
gives you that ability to orchestrate

01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,800
the life cycle

01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:49,520
and ainf is the part of that which

01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,360
allows you to

01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,880
operate that infrastructure in an

01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,640
automated and seamless way through the

01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,440
ai enablement and that's really our

01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,280
vision

01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,440
in terms of how an end-to-end network

01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,159
can be transition migrated as we go

01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,040
along

01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:03,679
and at the end of the day our job is to

01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,679
become an

01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:07,679
enabler for the network of the future

01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,320
and really enable this continuous life

01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,800
cycle

01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,440
for an operator in an automated fashion

01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,719
of

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:17,360
planning designing integration testing

01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,199
deploying it and then operating it and

01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,239
improving the customer experience by

01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:22,960
optimizing it

01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:23,360
and making it into a continuous cycle on

01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,040
a

01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,880
absolutely frequent basis that's what we

01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,040
are all about and with that

01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,360
thank you so much uh i appreciate the

01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,920
opportunity

01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,560
well thank you thank you manish uh

01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,640
awesome

01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,840
awesome look at it from a bird's eye

01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,600
view

01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,360
we definitely have a few questions for

01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,280
you i think

01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,600
the the one that would be relevant given

01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,600
your your global perspective is

01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,120
uh you know what you're seeing in terms

01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,719
of pulling things together you know

01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,320
building on open source projects

01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,080
bringing all these projects together

01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,600
not just in networking but networking

01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,760
plus ai plus edge

01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:02,960
and effectively getting to that economy

01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:06,560
is this just you know driven by u.s

01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,360
carriers european carriers apac you know

01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,040
where do you see

01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:11,280
from a global perspective where do you

01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,719
see this happening or is it like all

01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,719
around the world

01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,480
yeah i i think i would say it's actually

01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,560
very ubiquitous i mean if you had asked

01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,480
me our case the same question around

01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,480
12 to 18 months ago i would have

01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,159
probably said that it was more western

01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,080
and the tier one carriers globally who

01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:28,960
were mostly focused around that

01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,000
but today almost every conversation that

01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,600
i have with customers

01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,280
starts with automation ends with

01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,760
automation

01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,560
so but that but the journeys are

01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,400
different

01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,400
based on where they are today right some

01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,679
of them have a virtualized network that

01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,440
have already been

01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,280
tried and tested over the last four

01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,719
years but but the full value of the

01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,360
automation has not been achieved

01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,120
so for them it's more about how do i get

01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,920
this to the next stage and really go

01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,840
towards that

01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,360
fully automated network for others it's

01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,800
more of how do i start the journey and

01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,520
where do i start the journey

01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,560
but it's it's ubiquitous it's across the

01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,080
world

01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,679
all right very good i think there's a

01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,920
couple of more questions

01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,440
in a three-tier architecture as you see

01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,920
it uh

01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,199
where is the enterprise as edge

01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,760
geographically right

01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:15,199
is it on the prem is it leased colo

01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,360
shared facility

01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:18,480
right uh all of the above you know where

01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,320
do you see that

01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,920
that's that probably is the

01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,719
multi-billion dollar question

01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,320
uh at this point of time i kind of see

01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,440
that as

01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:31,760
you know clearly one place is the edge

01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,199
for the operators the network edge

01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,840
managed and operated

01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:36,560
by the csps that's the one clear place

01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,120
where it would

01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,800
reside as a as a as a place where it

01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,040
serves a larger community of

01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,040
enterprise customers then i see there

01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,960
are larger enterprises who are very

01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,520
clear in terms of their use cases that

01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,199
they say

01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,520
i've got my factory of the future that i

01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,080
want to automate i want to integrate my

01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,159
it

01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:56,080
and the ot networks and i want to put a

01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,679
lot of analytics at

01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,360
my premise so that i can actually

01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:01,280
control the the

01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,640
the the you know maintenance and repair

01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,560
operation or the asset performance

01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:07,040
management or my supply chain that goes

01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,440
in and out of the manufacturing plant

01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,280
there are manufacturing units were clear

01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,719
that i wanted on-prem so some of them

01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,880
are moving to the on-prem

01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,880
but i see to be starting more at the

01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,320
network edge at the csps and then

01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,320
slowly moving into more into the

01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,239
enterprises excellent

01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,840
excellent well thank you very much

01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,239
manish that was very insightful

01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,880
for that global perspective thank you

01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:30,480
very much

01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,480
thank you i appreciate it

01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:36,800
all right uh so uh we have uh

01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,760
one of the one of the top leaders in the

01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,920
ecosystem

01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:44,159
uh you know if in fact um i would say

01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,159
a visionary that has really shaken up

01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,600
the entire open source market right in

01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:50,800
the last five years

01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:53,280
and we all know chris rice and we know

01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,040
we all know him from from listening to

01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,080
him and following his leadership and

01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:59,280
direction

01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:01,520
well uh he's now the ceo of

01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,560
sterlite technologies limited access

01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,920
solutions

01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:07,679
stl as we call it um and you know

01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,360
it's a different perspective because now

01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:12,239
he will probably you know

01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,800
look at this market differently and you

01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,640
know we just

01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,560
thought it would be great to hear from

01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,719
him uh

01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,719
how he sees the world different you know

01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:24,000
obviously people know him from his

01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:26,560
amazing role at atnt but you know i

01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,480
don't think i need any more

01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:37,840
detailed introduction for chris so chris

01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:37,840
thank you for joining and welcome

01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,480
hey armpit thanks uh i really do

01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,080
appreciate that i'll try and live up to

01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:47,280
about half that height

01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:48,000
that you gave me um but i i chose to

01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,760
give a

01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,920
talk today on what i was calling

01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,040
delivering on the promise of open stn

01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,159
because you know

01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,159
those of you who follow like the

01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,760
gardener hype curve i think

01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,920
you know we've been through that roller

01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,520
coaster on some of this open sdn but

01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,800
it's clear that we're in this delivery

01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,560
phase now

01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,800
then you know what what manish was

01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,239
saying and and omar was saying around

01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,000
you know these indian use cases and

01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:12,800
preparing from customers

01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,560
hearing that same thing but i i want to

01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,199
step back a little bit before i get into

01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,800
the talk

01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:18,719
deeply and just talk about kind of what

01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,400
i consider the phases

01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,159
of development that we've gone through

01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,440
but maybe also another phase that we're

01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:25,920
getting into and i think

01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,560
folks who spoke before me hinted around

01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,400
it

01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,080
but you know as an example you can look

01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,920
at the first phase you know maybe go

01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,360
back about four years and there was sdn

01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,960
for wire line it

01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,560
leveraged what happened in the data

01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,719
centers uh

01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,239
you know an example milestone is you

01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:43,040
know we're working on the

01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:44,719
honolulu the eighth release of onap and

01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,560
clearly people have deployed it and you

01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,920
know they've gotten value from it

01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,920
you know it was going up against you

01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,080
know systems that were decades old and

01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,280
delivering value and so i think a lot of

01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,280
folks did a lot of hard work that

01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,639
they're proud of for that and i think

01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,080
some of that learning some of the

01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,679
learnings that came from that kind of

01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,199
was that next phase and i think these

01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:03,199
were all still going concurrently but

01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:05,360
there was clearly a next phase around

01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:07,360
hey listen uh it's possible that my

01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,000
integration with the bss systems that i

01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,239
have

01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,600
could limit my ability to put these sdn

01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:13,280
systems in place and

01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,480
what do i go do about that and i give

01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,360
credit you know that's maybe like a

01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,280
three-year

01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,960
journey that we're on so far and still

01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,120
work working excuse me

01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,880
but you know i give credit to the tm

01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:25,679
forum you know their open

01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,400
api manifesto guy lupo his team in

01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,080
telstra

01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,159
for network abstraction as a service

01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,520
and so i i think that that was clearly a

01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:35,199
phase it was again meant to like knock

01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,800
down roadblocks and then

01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:38,560
maybe a something that we're on for

01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,360
about two years now is this kind of

01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,199
open sdn for wireless and it was really

01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,960
started as a result of the fact that the

01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,560
other areas had momentum

01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,040
and that they could then go push and

01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,880
disaggregate the wireless network and

01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,400
have things like the you know brand

01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,719
intelligent controller

01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,400
x apps and all these other things that

01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,120
are now applying to the wireless area

01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,560
and i think

01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,159
kind of coincidentally and maybe not

01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,120
because so coincidentally around that

01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,800
same time

01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,000
i think you saw the public cloud

01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,920
starting to get interested from an

01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,920
infrastructure standpoint

01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,320
in doing things around these open sdn

01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,239
solutions but i think i'd argue that

01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,000
you know we're moving into another phase

01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:16,159
and while all those other faces were

01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,080
strongly about innovation and clearly

01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:20,080
there's innovation in this next phase

01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,960
i think this phase is a little bit about

01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:26,000
synthesis and you know amar and his talk

01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,360
alluded to this but you know if

01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,520
you think about it what we really need

01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:32,320
to do now is

01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,360
look at what i would call open

01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,719
end-to-end

01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:38,960
sdn native solutions and end-to-end and

01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,480
solutions are key terms there

01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,159
you know as we move forward i'll talk a

01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,960
little bit more about that

01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:46,880
you know in my talk but i think moving

01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,960
into this next phase is key

01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,000
uh because you know we're moving from

01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,960
ideas

01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,320
to implementation we're moving from pox

01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,320
to production

01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,679
you know we're moving from skunk works

01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,199
to scale

01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,400
and i think if we're going to continue

01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:01,440
on that journey and make those

01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,960
transitions

01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,880
it's going to be important for this next

01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:08,560
transition to be able to help us

01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:10,239
help us move in that direction so

01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,400
you know let me let me start by talking

01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:14,080
in an armpit gave this you know

01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:16,800
i'm certainly talking for a new company

01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,800
and a new job since the last time we

01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,800
spoke and kind of why is that well

01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,199
one reason is that i saw this phase

01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,960
coming right i saw the fact that

01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,960
you know there was a need for this

01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,239
end-to-end solutioning for these open

01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,920
kind of native sdn

01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:31,360
solutions and i really quite frankly

01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,000
wanted to be part of that

01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,960
um and it was something that i thought

01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,400
um

01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,320
you know if i went and did this that i

01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,960
could help telcos make this

01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,080
technology more consumable and more

01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,840
deployable

01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,199
um for some based on some of the work

01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,440
that we had done in the past

01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:48,960
in my previous jobs and so you know a

01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,520
little bit about the company you know

01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,840
stl

01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:52,960
access solutions you know it's a brand

01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,880
new business unit

01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,440
it's a us-based company it's dedicated

01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,840
to

01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:02,239
what i would call open sdn solutions at

01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:06,960
the edge i think fiber and 5g

01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:08,320
products software integration services

01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,320
and you know kind of my favorite part

01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,600
about the job is growth you know three

01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,880
favorite things real estate location

01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,239
location location

01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,480
three favorite things about the job or

01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:18,320
growth growth growth uh you know we're

01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,840
growing teams in all the areas we have

01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,440
an existing core team in india we're

01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,639
growing that team we're creating a new

01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,080
team in the us but

01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,760
certainly we recognize the talents

01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:28,159
worldwide and we'll be smart about you

01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:30,560
know how we go and attract that talent

01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,520
um you know it's part of a a much bigger

01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,520
company in india

01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,360
uh stl parent company is kind of known

01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,280
as a digital integrator

01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,960
uh optical connectivity company does

01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:41,120
fiber deployment network integration

01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:45,840
services so it's a new business unit

01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:45,840
associated with that and really

01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,719
quite frankly the goal of solution seo

01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:52,480
access solutions to take advantage of

01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,800
these trends and momentum and ecosystem

01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,920
that

01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,880
you know you've been talking about we've

01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,320
been talking about the conference and

01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:59,199
others before you've been talking about

01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,120
and quite frankly to scale the business

01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:04,159
for commercial success

01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:05,520
of these open end-to-end uh cloud-native

01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:07,280
solutions

01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,199
and you know basically to do that you

01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,960
know work in open source

01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:13,120
fora and what i'll call open source

01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:17,280
standard and standards aligned to that

01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:19,840
you know it's critical um and

01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,199
as you all can see you know i'll say it

01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,520
takes a village

01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:25,199
to be part of this ecosystem there there

01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,800
is there's not a lack of

01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,639
places that you can participate and i

01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,520
certainly won't read these

01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:33,360
i think everybody on the you know event

01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,440
today is familiar with them

01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,960
um but i think what i would say is that

01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,800
you know as we look at

01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,159
customer requirements specific

01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:44,239
requirements and specific

01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:46,080
call outs in rfis rfqs rfps

01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:48,560
you know the participation and

01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:50,960
contributions in these areas

01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,679
in providing solutions that align with

01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,960
the work

01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:56,719
that's done in them you know is required

01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,239
you know that's that's that's a that's a

01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,199
significant part of the conversation

01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:01,280
that we have

01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:02,560
when we talk to customers and so i you

01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,080
know just kind of like to recognize the

01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,600
folks that do this that that hard work

01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,520
is paying off and we're starting to see

01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,639
some momentum changes

01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:13,199
um but you know i think

01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:15,600
and i'm going to extend even what what

01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:18,639
amar said a little bit further which is

01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,600
i think cooperation greater cooperation

01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:22,080
between

01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,880
the bodies that i show here and even

01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,960
others

01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,639
is key to gaining traction it's key to

01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,560
gaining momentum and i'm going to go in

01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,239
a little bit more about that but

01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,800
you know kind of my takeaway from this

01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,360
is that what telcos are buying is

01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,280
changing

01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,679
they are buying more open more cloud

01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:41,679
native you know

01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:43,840
more more sdn based solutions

01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:45,120
but quite frankly how they're buying it

01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,400
isn't really changing they're still

01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,280
looking for someone who's going to do

01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,639
end-to-end

01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,719
we're still looking for someone to take

01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:52,560
responsibilities for the areas of domain

01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:54,880
that you're providing a solution in

01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:57,120
and so a little bit maybe of what i call

01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:59,199
that dichotomy has to be recognized

01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,960
uh as you as you move into this next

01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,239
phase um

01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,400
and so let me let me use that to

01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:07,120
transition to what will be

01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,800
you know my company's priorities uh for

01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,560
2021.

01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,080
and since i'm like nine days ten days

01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,120
into the job i reserve the right to

01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:17,120
modify these a little bit with time but

01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,880
um you know our goal is basically to

01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,880
take advantage of these opportunities

01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,840
uh open networking opportunities at the

01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:25,760
edge and think again think fiber and 5g

01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,760
you know 5g obviously worldwide fiber

01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,360
worldwide but fiber especially in europe

01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,719
we're seeing a lot of

01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,960
efforts there and like so how are we

01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:34,080
going to do that well look one of one of

01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,760
the ways we're going to do that

01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,440
is you know obviously organic growth of

01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:40,000
our own products and services

01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:41,760
and software but part of it is also to

01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,360
find the right partnerships to supply

01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,199
this what i'll call full-service

01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:47,360
end-to-end delivery of these sdn data

01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:48,239
solutions it's a recognition that it's

01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:51,199
likely going to take

01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:52,000
more than one company to go and do that

01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,280
and then i think

01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,239
if you look at the members of the

01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:57,840
ecosystem they're things that stl

01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:59,440
access solutions can do to kind of

01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,520
complement fill gaps

01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,480
of others in the ecosystem think of

01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,560
those as like other

01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,840
what i'll call disruptors cloud players

01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:09,280
system integrators and

01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:11,280
maybe even some oems um and so our whole

01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:13,360
goal again is to make it more consumable

01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,520
more deployable and to bring this

01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:17,199
end-to-end mindset which is key

01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,199
because again the way they're buying

01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:22,000
isn't changing and so

01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:23,840
in my mind to be successful here and and

01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,280
to talk about everyone's priorities if

01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,760
you will who want to be a part of this

01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,560
is

01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,360
embrace this open end-to-end sdn native

01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,520
movement

01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:33,520
embrace the fact that you know you're

01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,600
going to bring a

01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:37,920
full-service solution to the table

01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,920
because how telcos are buying

01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,520
is not changing it's not likely to

01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,520
change and at least for

01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,199
us and in the way we're building this

01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,560
company we're going in

01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:49,120
into this and say we're building a

01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,360
business plan and a cost structure

01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,159
for the company from the ground up to

01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,679
basically

01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:57,120
embrace this movement and to gain

01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:59,760
traction in this sdn data solution space

01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:01,280
and so you know one of the things that i

01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,840
think would be useful is to understand

01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,600
well

01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,679
you know how can the ecosystem itself

01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,120
help you know what what can we do in the

01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,960
ecosystem and i'm going to

01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,239
echo a little bit of what lamar said but

01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,199
i think i'm going to extend it a little

01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:13,199
bit and so

01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:14,800
you know for instance you can think

01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,520
about use cases that encompass

01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,639
infrastructure

01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,920
network systems bss flows operations and

01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:21,600
so these kind of

01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,760
use cases move from what i'll call

01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,239
isolated use cases to integrated use

01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,880
cases

01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:28,400
and clearly that super use case of mars

01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,880
is an example of that but i would argue

01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,639
that

01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,960
you still need to add some things around

01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:35,120
operations and bss flows to that

01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:36,719
because that's what's important to the

01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,840
telcos that's how you're actually going

01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,120
to make these sales that's how you're

01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,320
going to close their sales

01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,080
that's how they're going to move from

01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,440
the products and services that they're

01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:46,639
on to these open

01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,920
sdn native solutions and again i think

01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:51,199
this is key to gaining

01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:54,159
success in these solutions and again

01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:55,440
movement from you know ideas to

01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:57,360
implementation

01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:59,280
movement from pox to production to

01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,480
movement from skunk works to scale

01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,920
those are the kind of things that you

01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,719
should look for in the market and in the

01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,560
industry

01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,159
to basically what i would call

01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,239
milestones of success

01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:09,679
are we actually doing that right you

01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,400
know at least the way i'm thinking about

01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:12,320
this is

01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,679
think about an ability to have what i

01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,840
would call a

01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:18,400
network ready icon but that network

01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:21,120
ready is end-to-end solution based

01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,719
and it deals with infrastructure on

01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,159
obviously various platforms that we've

01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,360
talked about it deals with the

01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:27,120
service areas it deals with the

01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,560
application area third-party

01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:32,080
applications

01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,960
oss bss and operations those are the

01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,719
kind of things

01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,320
in a specific domain you can't be all

01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,760
things to all people but if you're going

01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,719
to be in a domain those are the things

01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,080
you got to cover

01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,560
to really say that you're going to be

01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:44,800
doing something end to end

01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,880
and so with that let me just close there

01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,320
say i'm super excited to be here talking

01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:51,360
with everybody today

01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:52,880
very excited to be the new ceo of stl

01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,480
access solutions and

01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,239
let me see if in the next few minutes or

01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,080
maybe a couple questions about what i've

01:30:56,239 --> 01:31:00,639
said

01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,360
absolutely and and for those of you you

01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,199
know uh

01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,400
who have questions there's a q a button

01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:06,639
on the on the right

01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,000
please please fire them i'm sure it's

01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:10,239
it's coming over

01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,719
but chris i i think the thing that

01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:14,639
always amazes me is every time you speak

01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:17,920
and do keynotes for

01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:22,400
for the industry i always learn you know

01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:24,800
uh a few words or phrases that simplify

01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,560
what we all have to do right like i love

01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,360
how you sort of said it in three lines

01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,320
you know from

01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:32,080
poc to production skunk works to scale

01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:34,320
and from isolated to integrated use

01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:36,159
cases so

01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,920
i think that was kind of the theme of of

01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,480
the whole conference and i think you hit

01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,080
a home

01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:45,600
run by just saying that um i think the

01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:47,040
uh the the the i think we're starting to

01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,840
get questions here but

01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,880
um you know how do you see uh

01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:55,040
convergence

01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,760
on the uh you know at the access layer

01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,679
if you may

01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,960
right because you have specific

01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:02,000
broadband access

01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,440
you know 5g may you know 4g had some

01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,080
fixed wireless but you know it may

01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:08,080
replace

01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:10,159
or 5g may replace or add on to it

01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:12,159
and and how do you see the convergence

01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:14,080
happening in that layer

01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:16,080
now that ram is starting to get

01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,600
disaggregated with oran and all that so

01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,040
in general you know from an access

01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,920
evolution perspective because

01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,880
a lot of emphasis has been on core right

01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,120
then we moved

01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,000
into the edge last couple of years which

01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,040
you know still going

01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,480
on and now into access so how how do you

01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,239
see that you know

01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,920
well let me let me slice out a couple

01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:35,360
ways i think one is for instance let's

01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,239
talk about edge well

01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,520
the reality is for edge use cases by

01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,639
definition if you're going to have low

01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,760
latency

01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,560
then you as the operator need to own

01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,560
that link

01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,080
you need to own that access link and let

01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,440
me just give you an exam that's true for

01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,920
wireline or wireless

01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:54,320
let me give you an example uh you know i

01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,639
if i happen to have a pop

01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,840
a point of presence right by an

01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:59,199
enterprise

01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,040
and let's say that enterprise doesn't

01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,400
use my broadband but they use some other

01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,920
third-party broadband

01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,480
even though i'm literally right across

01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:08,159
the street it's possible that

01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:10,560
you know the the head end of their

01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:12,960
equipment isn't even in the same city it

01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,719
might be in denver if they're in dallas

01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,159
and then the flow and the latency

01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:17,840
associated with the flow

01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:19,520
has to do with when does my network

01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,880
touch theirs and where does it touch and

01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,080
everything else and even though it's

01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,800
right across the street it could have a

01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:26,159
high latency flow so being on the edge

01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,920
and actually delivering on the edge and

01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:29,440
low latency at the edge there's a

01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:32,000
definition of access

01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,600
there's a definition of ownership of the

01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,080
access link to be able to do it so you

01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,800
can

01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,840
deliver on that promise of end-to-end

01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,320
latency

01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:42,719
and i think for from my standpoint you

01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,239
know fiber and 5g if you will

01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:46,320
uh they're like peanut butter and jelly

01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:49,199
in other words i i can't go and think

01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:52,400
about improving my 5g

01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:54,480
unless i've gone and improved my

01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:56,639
routing capability to sell site my

01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:59,760
backhaul capability to sell site

01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:01,360
i can't deliver on a end-to-end slice if

01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,880
i don't have the ability to do it just

01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,760
more over the air link or just over the

01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,600
mobile core

01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,360
but i got to be able to do it over my

01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,040
access network the metro network and in

01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,440
the core itself and then

01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:12,400
running use cases that look like that

01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:15,120
are key and so

01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,679
in my mind these things this edge and

01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,320
access

01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:19,199
and wire line and 5g and the apps that

01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,960
go with them

01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:22,880
are integrally linked and that's why i

01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,400
was kind of pushing for this

01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,320
this is why we need these end-to-end use

01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,840
cases because you can spend a lot of

01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,199
time doing things that look really good

01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,639
in the lab

01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:32,320
but you want to make sure that it

01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:33,520
actually follows through on these

01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,880
customers networks

01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,600
and works in production gotcha very nice

01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,560
uh

01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,560
there's probably one more question uh uh

01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,400
several have come up but i'll i'll just

01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,840
try to sort of summarize that

01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,199
um yeah i don't know if you want to just

01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,119
send me these an email i don't know what

01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,920
the process is yeah yeah we we could do

01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:51,679
that and you know

01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,080
jillian will work with you directly to

01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:56,719
get it uh but i think the

01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:58,000
the question is really around uh how do

01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,639
you see the

01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,760
companies the service providers right

01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:03,600
have they really

01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,040
moved into an execution and an

01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,920
implementation phase

01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:09,360
or are they still playing with open

01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,800
software and things like that

01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:14,400
uh well you know i i think it's i think

01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,440
it's hard to to

01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:19,760
you know talk about everybody

01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,520
right but let me just say this that you

01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,920
know when i

01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:25,280
um you know when we started down this

01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,040
path it was clear that there were only a

01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,480
few kind of pioneers and then more

01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:30,560
people got on board

01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,400
um but you know you know going back to

01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,400
what manish was saying that you know i i

01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,440
don't have conversations with customers

01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,960
that

01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,159
don't have this as a core component i

01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,679
mean i didn't write down the slide

01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:41,760
because i was speaking

01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,280
oh naf i mean you know people are asking

01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,800
like what are you doing in this space

01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,000
you know what is your contribution how

01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,679
does this align

01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,440
you know where where are the points of

01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:51,280
interface right and so

01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:52,719
and they're coming out with rfi's rfps

01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,719
are fused that are

01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:56,800
aligned to that in other words i want a

01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,840
solution that's aligned to this

01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:01,600
and i think then the impetus becomes

01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,239
showing them that you can do that in the

01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,320
way that they want but do it at scale

01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,920
and take end-to-end responsibility in my

01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:10,159
mind that's the key

01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,440
and i i don't know that there are a lot

01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:13,520
of folks who can kind of

01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,960
go and do that own on their own maybe

01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,159
other than the incumbents

01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:19,199
i think that there's an interest to

01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:21,760
provide a a growth in the ecosystem so

01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:23,360
it might be that you know folks have to

01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,040
figure out how

01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,040
other each of us to complement one

01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,880
another you know as opposed to kind of

01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:31,119
trying to do everything on our own

01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,639
yep the true power of collaboration

01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,000
excellent i mean this is what you had

01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:36,639
dreamt of so

01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
i think and and uh given leadership to

01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,800
the entire ecosystem so

01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,880
really chris we really appreciate and

01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,800

of you given given that you are now sort

01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,760
