there are three housekeeping notes that

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
i want to highlight

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,320
number one this is live

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,719
and please ask question answers it's a

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,440
rare opportunity when you get that

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
you know in front of executives uh so

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
it's

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,280
on your top right chat we will answer as

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,320
many questions as possible so that's

number one

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,000
number two this is closed caption in 16

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
languages worldwide right so there's a

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,320
widget below your uh

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,240
session screen if you want to change the

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,320
language uh you know i can speak

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
force i'll try and confuse the ai system

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,360
but you know hey no no

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
i'm told don't do that and then the

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,119
third thing is

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,680
if you get confused or have any issues

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,920

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,240
i want to quickly get into what

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,040
onif is and how it's different

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,000
it's three days in three separate time

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,200
zones

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,360
uh optimized for eu north america

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,920
and asia and it's with 30 almost 30

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
executives thought leaders from the

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,320
world

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,119
covering many many topics across

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
the enterprise across the edge cloud

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,160
telcos etc

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,000
and we have also incorporated lessons

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,360
learned from the past one year of these

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,319
virtual events so

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,120
uh first i want to thank the lf events

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,239
team for

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,560
opening up onif to the global

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
participating community for those of you

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
who have been attached with

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
open network united summit or ons or one

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,959
es

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,680
we used to have something called onif

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,040
open innovation forum which was a

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,599
invitation only event um that was kind

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160
of

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,760
limited in participation but with this

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,120
opening up you know we are now in the

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,319
hundreds and thousand

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
people that can actually participate in

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,400
a live session

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,760
and hear the leaders uh

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
the information that you're going to be

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,239
provided is not you know

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,239
too visionary it's really you know

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,080
focused on what's going on

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,000
what you can benefit on both personally

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
and professionally and obviously i want

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,720
to really thank all the executives

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,680
to that are are participating today to

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
take the time

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,879
i know it's a busy time for all of us

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
and and

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,360
and uh you know just taking time and

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,599
talking to the ecosystem

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
and and communicating their priorities

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,080
is extremely valuable to this community

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
of

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
of open networking and edge formats

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,959
going to be fairly straightforward

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,640
10 to 15 minutes of either presentation

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,640
live q a quick questions quick answers

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,680
and if we can get to everything you know

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,760
obviously follow up on that

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
the themes and the presentations will go

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,440
into what is possible today

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,760
and uh you know in cases of edge

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,360
some new applications some use cases

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,480
some of the displays

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
or what the 2021 priorities are for the

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,159
community

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,120
so with that said let me get into

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,959
a two-slide overview of people who are

00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,360
not familiar with the linux foundation i

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,280
doubt

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,640
but you know it's a good refresher we're

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,159
more than linux

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,720
we host uh multiple technology projects

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,319
and multiple market disruptive

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,480
collaboration entities right

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,239
whether it's security networking cloud

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,840
automotive blockchain

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,040
edge web etc etc so we're the home of

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,600
of many many projects to foster

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,320
and build this open collaboration uh

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,479
obviously

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,919
two thousand plus members from 41 plus

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,320
countries

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,160
lots of developers now you can say not a

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,040
single

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,520
vendor or a community member can

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,280
actually

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,880
hire so many developers but they're all

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,680
working for you all and they're all on

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,600
the some of them are on the call

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
but this is where you know shared

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,000
collaboration

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,759
uh is really beneficial to everybody uh

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,120
and especially on these uh critical open

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,240
source projects

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,960
uh the stats may not be visible uh in

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,960
your screen

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
but you know feel free to download it on

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,960
the lf

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,960
lf website you know millions of pull

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,000
requests millions of changes

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,880
lots of load bills securities scans etc

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,680
etc

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,720
so that's linux foundation very excited

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
to

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,919
you know uh host and participate in in

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,960
this

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,520
open networking edge executive forum

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,479
and so with that what i want to quickly

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,400
cover

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,600
are uh you know a report card and a 2021

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,560
set of priorities

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,880
for our technology and our projects

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,280
which kind of lead into an ecosystem

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,919
and production deployment and then i

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,720
think the most

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,440
interesting thing that's happening this

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
year

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,600
is that different vertical markets

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,280
are pulling these open source projects

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,639
and starting to use them in their

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,560
vertical industries

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,320
and we have not seen that in the past

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,440
other than maybe you know the networking

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
and the telecom

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,560
and maybe the clouds providers but all

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,319
of a sudden

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,479
we have different vertical markets

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,639
relying on that underneath

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,160
open pipe and that open plumbing that

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,800
has been created over the last five

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,800
years

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,240
so very excited about that and we'll

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,560
talk about that

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
uh and talking about which industries i

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,319
think

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,240
continuing to my through my keynote that

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,319
i did last fall

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,360
we have a whole set of industries

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,560
whether it's telecom

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,319
automotive motion pictures banks fintech

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
public health energy these are all

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,960
hundred plus year old industries

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,960
they've just transformed through open

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
source with very rapid innovation you

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
you might you may want to download this

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,280
white paper on the linux foundation site

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,520
that shows

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
how why and what of each of these

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
industries

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,720
and we're going to zoom in on networking

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
edge but you can see the flavors of

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
other industries

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
being covered in several of these

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,280
presentations

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,199
what's happened is in the last 10 years

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
we got a whole set of technology

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,360
disruptions

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,919
right whether it's virtualization

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,199
disaggregation

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,759
uh automation cloud native etc that led

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,240
to

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,479
projects under the linux foundation

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,599
specifically in networking and edge

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,919
uh utilizing these technologies creating

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,400
a community and then providing code and

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,280
and open interoperability for most of

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,240
these

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,199
where we are heading is in the next five

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,400
plus years

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,680
is putting this end-to-end open source

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,360
uh software solutions to use in vertical

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
market right whether it's edge whether

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,479
it's intent based policy based

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,720
and using the entire

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,400
ecosystem and not just one or two

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,840
projects so that's what is

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,319
very exciting this year and when

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
when you talk about these projects uh

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,400
this is a view of a

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,520
set of sample projects then can actually

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,599
create a full

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,160
end-to-end open source ecosystem

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,759
through collaboration from the mobile

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,919
networks to residential broadband

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,160
networks to small office medium office

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,840
to large enterprise right which have

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
their own data centers

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,479
and you come in through the access get

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,639
into the edge

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,080
come through some version of cloud and

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,360
then in the core you have a whole

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,319
vertical stack

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
that does data plane acceleration

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
network control

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
uh management orchestration analytics

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,120
and a whole set of new functions

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,240
uh that that build on this

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,400
for various applications

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,319
this is a very powerful uh kind of

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,879
phenomena where you can actually put it

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,360
all

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,120
in perspective and i think you may be

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,760
aware of two

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
projects magma being an opel mobile core

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,080
which

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,560
linux foundation is hosting now and

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,240
anuket which is the combination of cmtt

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,959
and opnfv that was announced this

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
quarter

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,480
both of those are extremely powerful

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,680
projects that

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,720
make up uh the end-to-end stack

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,800
uh so if you look at

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,959
beyond these projects what's more

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,959
important and i talked about anakin but

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,839
i want to point out this circle that

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,839
really accelerates the deployment so how

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,080
do we take projects that we host

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,600
which creates software and gets it into

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,040
products from vendors and system

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
integrators and end users

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,200
and push it into production and so the

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,600
back end of this cycle

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,560
needs to be accelerated and what is seen

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
in the back end

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
are open compliance and verification

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
open interoperability

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,080
and testing and open training and

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,480
certification you cannot have

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,800
every end user test and interoperate

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
multiple things based on standard set of

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,959
objectives right so

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,200
this is where projects like anuket comes

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,080
in

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,640
projects like lf edges of crano come in

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
where

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,760
you know there are a set of blueprints

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,839
that i'll talk about in a bit

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,279
uh the one thing i also want to

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,160
emphasize is

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,080
when you talk about end to end you know

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,880
all the way from rand to edge to core

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
there's a set of uh umbrellas that we

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,399
are going to sort of

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
utilize to create what you know we're

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,240
calling

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,360
you know 5g super blueprint but things

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,959
like uh the lfn end to

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
that were that have been historically

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,200
shown at the o nes

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,320
uh you know will be augmented by the

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,480
community to

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
include you know the ran and the edge

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,200
and the core and

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,720
kind of bring it all together in a very

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,839
simplistic manner so that

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,160
end users can allow for

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,120
quick rapid deployment what we have seen

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
is

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
six months of interrupt and production

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
testing

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,160
have been cut down to six weeks so

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,279
significant

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,640
changes uh in the deployment cycle

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,079
uh because of the back-end

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,640
interoperability and blueprints

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,279
so then where are we heading and what's

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,600
new

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,279
and i think this slide is is an

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,120
extremely important slide because what

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,040
has happened is you take all these

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,320
end-to-end open source projects and for

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,800
those those of you are not familiar

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,560
they're like

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,640
they'll look like a bunch of logos and

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,320
acronyms but i showed it in the

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,519
architecture diagram

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,399
and these projects have all of a sudden

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
started

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,160
uh being used in

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,000
major segments so give you some examples

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,040
here enterprise networking

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,040
uh with the private lte fi private 5g

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,959
and private lte kind of a use case and a

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,640
blueprint

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,640
the enterprises are starting to use

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,560
these projects to get workloads

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
across clouds right in a multi-cloud

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,760
hybrid environment and you'll hear from

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,880
some of the industry leaders on how they

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,959
do it

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,079
there's there's end-to-end visibility

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,640
and monitoring

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,279
that an enterprise needs because now now

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
the

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,200
the last mile is no longer a last mile

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,800
with an edge and a centralized data

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,880
center in a public cloud

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,399
how do you kind of look at your own

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,000
workload and get monitoring and

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,560
visibility so some of the largest

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,320
of the large enterprises are helping the

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
underneath lying projects to move

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
forward on that

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,839
we've seen governments in the various

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,519
regions right whether it's north america

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,560
apac eu building on open and secure

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,680
you know 5g uh for example you know we

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,360
announced a project with the darpa dod

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,880
on on utilizing you know lfn and lfh

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,040
to create an open source uh framework

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,959
for the government to use in 5g

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
applications iot and edge

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,959
and and that's all being built off the

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,920
open source

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,920
trains that that we've seen and then

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,079
we've seen projects that drive

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,200
global connectivity in developing

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,680
countries in

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,040
in kind of countries that that just need

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,360
basic connectivity

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,519
at a very low cost and and kind of very

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,519
simple open manner

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,160
we've also seen some of the unique

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,959
industries in the broadcast sector

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,720
uh come in and and demo uh you know

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,440
spectrum sharing whether it's based on

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,480
onap

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,480
plus or nsc uh you know the atsc and

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,200
you'll hear from madeline later on

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,079
uh in the conference uh she's the

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,320
president of this

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,200
uh you know atsc 3.0 and you know it's

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,480
it's a huge

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,120
undertaking on how the underneath

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
uh pipe and platform that we as a

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,279
community have created

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
gets used and then of course uh edge and

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,519
iot

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,519
is is is the hottest market

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,600
vertical that has has been driven and

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,639
you will see so many use cases presented

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,519
in the

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,839
in the in on if this week but to point

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,160
out

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,200
a few industries that have really taken

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,399
up the challenge

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,320
manufacturing energy oil gas retail

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,639
home automotive fleet transportation et

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,600
cetera et cetera these are sort of hot

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,399
and in order to facilitate some of this

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,079
um

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,279
we're seeing um a big definition

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,079
and a big alignment of edge resources

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,519
in the community so this slide if you

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,519
know you want to take a screenshot

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,440
please go ahead and do that because

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,360
you know people have been using loose

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,800
terminology on edge for quite some

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
time you know thin edge and thick edge

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,560
and forage and near edge and

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,880
you know whatever they're all relative

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,760
terms and and what the community did

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,959
as part of state of the edge research

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
which by the way

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,880
was announced today that it the latest

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,639
copy of that 2021 is

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,199
just out for download uh please do that

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,519
uh you know it's a very very detailed

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
and exhaustive analysis there

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
but in that you can see that there's

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,480
only two types of edges from a

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,079
terminology perspective there's a user

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,320
edge and a service provider edge

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,920
a user edge is dedicated and operated by

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,279
the user or service provider edge is

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,279
shared and as a service

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,880
and if you double click that there's not

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,639
one implementation but there's a

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,560
constrained device edge right whether

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,360
it's microcontroller embedded right

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,440
very tight constraints or kind of a

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,240
gateway type smart device edge

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
or an on-prem pipe edge which could have

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
multiple

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,480
uh you know secure locations and then

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,680
last mile separates it

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,880
puts it on the base station and or smart

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
central offices

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,480
and then anything centralized is kind of

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
not edge you know it could be an iot

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,120
application but not edge if it wakes up

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,920
every

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,760
month and dumps some sensor data and

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,040
then we have a whole bunch of projects

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,560
to support that um which i want to

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
point out a couple you know edgex

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,320
foundry being uh

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,279
you know a framework and then you will

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
hear from say

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
fletch and eve and some of the other

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,519
projects later in the conference today

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,720
as well

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,279
and then from a blueprint perspective we

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
have

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,399
what is called a crano and this is very

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,600
important because you can actually

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,320
utilize

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,320
um the use cases and blueprints for

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,079
doing things like connected cars or

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,360
augmented reality classrooms

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,560
or cameras or cloud gaming or a whole

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
bunch of things that

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,560
are important in the various parts of

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,480
edge and you will hear these use cases

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,519
as we go through the presentation

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,920
uh and and people today so

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,880
i want to wrap up with 2021 priorities

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,639
uh for us

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,880
in the community what we are hearing

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,199
from the community is

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,000
we need to focus on complete solutions

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,199
tax

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,560
to integrate and fully uh operate the

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,320
edge stack

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,320
uh edge and networking stack so very

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,560
critical um

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,880
as part of that we're going to focus on

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,160
speeding up the back end interrupt

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,639
deployment process and then finally help

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,240
these vertical markets start embracing

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,120
and utilizing and building

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,759
on these open source cloud stacks so

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,160
with that

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
i think what i'm going to do is wrap up

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,639
right here

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,880
and i i'm going to uh

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,360
show you what wonderful treat you are in

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
for

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,360
in terms of the number of speakers the

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,639
quality and the depth of the top

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,880
executives today

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,160
and tomorrow and after tomorrow you know

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,639
they comprise of

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,000
edge iot end users enterprise service

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,240
providers cloud vendors

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,399
sis and more uh you know you could not

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,680
ask for we could not ask for a better

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,959
uh leadership roster to come in and

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,759
and present their ideas so with that

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,120
i again want to remind everybody if

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,160
there are questions

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,959
you can put them in the q a top right

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,920
they'll get to me and i will ask the

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,039
presenters on

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,559
on questions we'll try and answer as

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,319
many as possible

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,240
we won't we'll try not to take a break

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,760
between presentations but if you can

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,919
sort of send those questions

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,760
while the presenter is talking that'll

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,280
be fantastic

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,640
so with that i think i am at the end of

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,480
my presentation

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,360
and what i would like to do is uh

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,640
answer one of the questions uh that just

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,240
came through which is what are the

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,559
low-hanging fruits you see in the

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,039
vertical markets

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,880
the the first low-hanging fruit i would

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,919
say is the

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,720
each vertical market uh should focus

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,240
should not focus on doing their own life

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
cycle management

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,640
plumbing infrastructure management

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,559
abstractions of interfaces

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,160
uh etc etc right they all can focus on

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
their differentiation whether it's

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,960
hardware or software

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,000
and leave the lifecycle management the

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,080
plumbing as we call

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,840
it right the integrations and the apis

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,240
to a cloud or an enterprise

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,760
to the open source uh world so that i

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,559
think it's a great question

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,400
that's where most of the lfn lf edge and

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,960
lf projects are focused on

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
you know non-differentiating code at the

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
middle

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
of the pipe so thank you for the

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,080
questions

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,400
and i think we might be out of time

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,520
uh if we get more we will answer it as

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,240
as we go on

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,760
um but with that i am going to introduce

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,880
the the first keynote

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,760
uh presenters here um

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,679
which uh for which we have uh tom arthur

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,039
who is the ceo of dynamic

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:44,160
and chris uh bainter who is the vpa uh

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,039
of bd at flare systems they're going to

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,120
talk about

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,480
a unique application right remember i

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,200
told you if edge is

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,000
huge iot is huge and there's a whole set

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,240
of

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,520
applications that are coming up that are

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,080
being built on open source

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,679
projects and these applications provide

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,320
a unique sense of

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,640
edge computing resources close to you so

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,720
one such use case

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,679
that is built in the community by the

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,640
community

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,280
uh is is fascinating to learn so i with

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,000
that said

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,000
i'm going to hand it over to tom and

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,729
[Music]

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
chris

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,960
uh my name is uh tom arthur i'm with

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,720
dynamic and maybe chris we could start

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
with you introducing yourself and flir

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,919
systems

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,440
sure my name is chris boehner global

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,120
business development

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,559
at flear systems and i represent our

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,559
industrial side of the business

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
and uh i'm tom arthur co-founder and ceo

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,760
of dynamic

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and actually this this slide at the

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,360
lower right almost says the whole thing

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,240
so dynamic osisoft and

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,559
google started a project and contributed

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,960
it to the linux foundation edge group

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,000
called

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,320
fledge and it is focused uniquely on the

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,600
industrial iot edge

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,520
and for those that have been in

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,080
networking a long time i'm an old guy

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,559
actually

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,400
you might remember 1980s 90s when there

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,559
were multiple protocols multiple

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,720
physical layers like arc net

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,240
starland ethernet was just coming on

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
board and then you had protocols like

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,760
decnet

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,799
apple talk sna tcpip was just starting

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,360
out

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,039
in the ot space in the industrial space

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,320
the exact same chaos

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,440
exists you have numerous protocols that

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,200
are proprietary

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,440
semantics and data mappings that don't

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
make sense this guy's pump is defined

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,280
different than that guy's pump

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,120
so we're building an open source project

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,159
to enable industrials

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,200
on the edge to connect to any machine

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,200
or any sensor move that data process

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,200
that data and integrate that data

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,120
with any industrial system or any cloud

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,039
and the users of that are the data

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,880
scientists i call them the no code

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,440
engineers so this is a great mechanical

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
or

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,880
chemical engineer who doesn't know how

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,480
to code and how do you enable him to

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
write these applications

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
because tomorrow they have this

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,200
conversation they call the fourth

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,039
industrial revolution

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,400
and the fourth industrial revolution is

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,919
like the self-driving car

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,640
but it's becoming the self-driving

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,280
factory so so what what's happening

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,480
in industrials that's making this occur

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,760
which is what's happening really to

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
everybody on the edge

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,600
but specifically in industrial sensors

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,679
like flares

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,840
are getting way more powerful way less

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,000
expensive way more accurate

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,080
at the same time obviously the cost of

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,720
computing on the edge is going way way

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,480
down with incredibly powerful computers

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,240
at the same time you have these new

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
workloads you have machine learning you

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,240
can run dnns out on the edge

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,080
and tomorrow you're going to have

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,440
predictive maintenance on machines

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
you'll have the entire factory with

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,799
predictive maintenance

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,559
or even more importantly you'll have oee

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,600
applications that are optimizing

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,240
processes

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,200
on a batch by batch process and then you

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,840
combine that

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,960
with the ubiquity of networking today so

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,200
whether it's 5g

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,080
or private lte networks or the newest

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,000
wi-fi

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,640
networks the ability to connect all of

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,640
this edge run these new workloads

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
take this new sensor data and completely

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,960
automatic automate a factory

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,960
is happening so what exactly is

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,520
fledge and what are we doing on the edge

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,600
specifically in the industrial space

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,600
so in the industrial space like i said

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,440
earlier there are literally hundreds of

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,480
protocols that frankly i've never heard

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,520
of

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,159
things like bacnet things like dnp3 iec

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,039
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,880
used by energy companies in europe can

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,840
bus how you connect to a car

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,840
so all of these proprietary protocols

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,679
don't have common semantics don't have

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,520
common data mappings don't have common

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,080
ways to add meta information

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,000
and ingest the data the other major

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,320
problem you find in industrials is the

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,799
sources of the data is quite unique

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,880
so for instance if you're to stick a 40

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,400
kilohertz accelerometer on a piece of

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,679
rotating equipment

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,559
you're producing probably up to six gigs

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,480
of vibration data per hour and you are

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,520
not going to send six gigs of vibration

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,400
data that says hey

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,679
my pump is doing just fine to the cloud

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,559
so this is a classic

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,159
opportunity to do edge processing you

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,440
have to do edge processing actually

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,679
signal processing

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,520
so the first service is edge can fledge

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,440
can connect to any machine

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,360
it can actually do signal processing on

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,840
the edge it can ingest computer vision

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,919
it can

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,559
ingest a plc and take that data

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,559
and then the second feature in fledge is

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,200
the ability to aggregate

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,159
that data in context um tomorrow you'll

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,240
have a plc connected to some machine

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,919
and then you might take a fleer camera

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,600
pointed at the same machine you might

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,320
stick an accelerometer on that same

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
machine

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,960
so now i'm getting data from a plc from

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,159
a camera doing computer vision and an

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,080
accelerometer

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,760
and all that needs to be in the context

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,640
of the health and welfare of that

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,799
machine

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,360
so fledge can aggregate that data and

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,120
put that data together in context

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,120
and then the next major feature you need

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,720
of course is buffering because sometimes

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,080
as we all know the network goes up and

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,320
down so you don't want to lose that data

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,559
and then fledge can actually filter that

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,559
data so you can filter that data coming

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,799
into the edge from the machine from the

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,960
accelerometer like doing rms

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,039
root means square or fast fourier

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,000
transfers or doing high notes

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,480
high pass low pass filters and then you

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,080
can also filter that data as you send it

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,080
to the cloud

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,760
so you might have to compress that data

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
you might conditionally forward that

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,679
data

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,400
so you need to be able to filter the

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,960
data on the in and the out

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
and then fledge can actually also

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
operate

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,799
events and rules on the edge so you can

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,559
look at data

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,640
and do simple transformations like

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,720
convert celsius to fahrenheit

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,559
or you can do something as complex as

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,720
running tensorflow lite

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,799
and doing the latest dnns and doing

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,440
machine learning out on the edge

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,279
so fledge is naturally already connected

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,360
to these machines and the streaming data

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,120
from the sensors and the actuators

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,120
so it's also the natural place then to

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,559
stream that data through a new

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,080
machine learning model that might

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,360
predict the wear and tear on the

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,279
interrace bearing

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,880
and tell the repairman not only should

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,640
you go check the machine

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
you should actually take a new inner a

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,720
new bearing with you and replace it when

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,159
you show up

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,320
and then the last part of the

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,760
integration that clearly our pit was

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,120
also talking about is you need to

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,720
integrate this data

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,320
and in the case of industrials they have

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,760
tens of millions if not hundreds of

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,880
millions of dollars in capex

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,559
expenditures

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,080
they've spent on their scada systems

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,559
their dcs systems

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,320
their database historians their quality

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,640
control oee systems

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,480
so and then together we call this the

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,760
iso 95 stack

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,159
so that stack needs to receive that data

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,000
but also they are also looking at the

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,720
cloud and putting new workloads in the

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,799
cloud

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,799
so fledge enables them to send the data

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,559
they need to send to their historian

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,480
at the same time they need to send that

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,159
data to their data scientist using the

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,919
newest latest coolest tools

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,840
from google to build machine learning

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,840
models with

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,559
so you probably already have in mind

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,120
this slide that okay so fletch can

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,279
connect to a single sensor

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,279
process that data transform that data

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,279
send it to an on-prem

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,360
historian but as you can see on the

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,720
second panel here it can also connect as

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,480
i said to a plc

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,880
to a fleur camera and to an

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,640
accelerometer aggregate that data

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,640
and it can send that data once again to

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,120
the historian the oee system

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,440
but also to the cloud and then fledge is

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,520
also designed to talk to another fledge

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,520
so you can deploy these in hierarchies

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,799
or meshes and run the workloads at the

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,880
appropriate level

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,360
across this infrastructure and then

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,640
forward that data to your erp system

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,640
sitting in in amazon you can then send

00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,360
the data the ml data to your data

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,520
scientists

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,919
using google cloud you can send it to

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,600
kafka then to send that data to your erp

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,919
system and you can send it to the

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,200
on-prem stuff south of the firewall that

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,679
your operator uses

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,679
every day

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,320
and then last the reason this is a

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,480
really important

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,559
open source objective is really going

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,240
back to what i said if you're around in

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,279
1990 and when tcpip was just taking off

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,039
you know it was i.e

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,480
it was these standards committees that

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,679
solve these problems

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,080
but when you look today in 2021 these

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,080
real

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,000
big problems in computing when you have

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,600
fragmented diversity

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,039
and it's at the plumbing level right

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,200
here that is

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,600
perfect and today for open source

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,919
projects you can solve that problem

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,399
let's not reinvent the wheel so when

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,960
dynamic and osisoft and google

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,480
created the fledge stack and contributed

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,080
to the linux foundation where is the

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
best place to run governance

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,120
and everything about a serious open

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,880
source project

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,559
we contributed there and we started

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
encouraging not just technology

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,399
companies

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,000
but industrials themselves like flir

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,399
one of my favorite ones here you can see

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,279
in the middle corner there rte

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,600
so rte is the largest grid operator in

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,480
the

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,120
eu and so they then have looked at the

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,679
code

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,480
and there's another uh open source group

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,320
under linux foundation called lf energy

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,919
and this is a group of energy companies

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,640
and technology suppliers

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,799
building open source projects to solve

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,840
new problems in green energy

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,159
and so rte and the lf energy said hey

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,000
fledge is the right architecture for us

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,000
and so they've taken it in they call it

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,559
fledge power and now they're adding

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,279
these south protocols to fledge to tax

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,480
to to connect to their rtu server which

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,600
is the scada system

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,600
running in the substations so rte is

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,159
contributing iec 104

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,440
they're now riding 61 850 along with

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,720
swiss grid

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,440
nexcom is an advent is a a gateway

00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,679
provider

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,600
and they contributed j19 which is the

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,440
way you connect to a caterpillar tractor

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,279
so the community's taking off and then

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,120
we're super excited to have fleur using

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,120
it as well and with that i'll give it to

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,559
chris to talk about how flair

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,559
is using uh using fledge

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,799
yeah thanks tom for running through that

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,799
and i think you did a great job in

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,840
explaining you know the structure for

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,279
for flear in

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,960
the next few minutes i wanted to talk

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,679
about our uh

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,640
evolution in how we serve our customers

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,720
focusing on the

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,720
industrial space uh specifically

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,640
when we look at those types of customers

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,600
flir is best known for thermal infrared

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,640
cameras and if you're

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,240
not familiar with infrared

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,159
in in a couple seconds here it's

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,840
basically a way to get hundreds of

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,360
thousands or millions of points of

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,760
non-contact temperature

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,120
measurement uh accurately and so it

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,360
provides both

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,559
qualitative context of where hot spots

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,399
are and there may be

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,440
indicative of problems but also if you

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,559
want to get actual temperature

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,159
measurements and do trending over time

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,559
while we're associated mostly with

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,399
thermal infrared technologies actually

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,320
49 of our business comes from

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,840
non-thermal sensing types so we also

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,080
offer vibration

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,320
as well as acoustic emissions and other

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,720
types of sensing technologies

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,080
in the past we offer these technologies

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,440
to our customers

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,080
and a lot of times they were either

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,640
fixed mount or or man portable

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,039
and people use them to collect data and

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,679
then they would interpret those results

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,960
based on experience and training and

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,399
then decide how those

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,159
drive their decision support where flear

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,600
sees the biggest opportunity

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,399
based on market themes at high level

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,000
that resonate

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,600
across utility oil and gas and

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,360
manufacturing is

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,840
aging workforce you got workers that

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,440
have been uh doing this for 30 years how

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,559
do you replace that

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,279
decades of experience um

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,919
and our answer is and what we're

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,399
probably

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,399
all here looking at or to create more

00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,600
connected solutions that easily plug

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,080
into existing

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,960
uh systems that our end users are using

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,679
and also

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,200
helping move from data to decisions and

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,200
that gets into kind of the second column

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,880
here in terms of interconnected sensors

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,320
tom mentioned it but being able to

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,760
aggregate data

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,240
across multiple sensing types

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,600
and and plugging that into however the

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,200
customer likes to work

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,720
so instead of fleury trying to say

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,399
here's a specific

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,799
software and it works but you got to use

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,080
our siloed solution set we want to be

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,000
able to integrate

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,279
and work however the customer works and

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,840
then of course getting a decision

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
support

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,760
so when we take a closer look at that um

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,159
just a couple examples to to

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,559
get a little bit more into the specifics

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,600
common use cases for fleers

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,440
thermal infrared cameras our machine

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,120
condition monitoring you can see that

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,399
top image i believe is a palm

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,360
motor the second one maybe not as well

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,600
known

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,919
you can filter to a specific spectral

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,559
band and visualize

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,200
gas leaks and so you can not only detect

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,559
them

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,399
and alarm on them but you can also

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,440
quantify them the last one is more of a

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,279
process

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,039
automation control where here we're

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,399
maybe less concerned about the absolute

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,640
temperature measurement but more about

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,240
being able to visualize it and look for

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,760
potential problems where in the visual

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,640
we wouldn't be able to see

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,960
that contrast so common use cases again

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,799
where

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,399
used to be individuals carrying around

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,320
cameras doing it now being able to

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,320
automate those

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,679
and aggregate that with other types of

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,679
data tied into

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,039
maintaining these these different use

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,279
cases uh

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,159
which fledge empowers and working with

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,240
dynamic

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,240
really has opened up some possibilities

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,760
there not only to make our products more

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,200
plug and play with how our customers

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,600
work on the far right

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,360
uh in however they want to work it's not

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,159
tied to a specific software

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,080
historian or cmms system but really

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,000
making it work

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,360
in all those scenarios and then of

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,279
course getting into the

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,360
analytics and decision support and being

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,080
able to push that to the edge

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,840
tom talked about that the network load

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,159
and how that goes up and down so it's

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,279
not

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,480
feasible to take hundreds of thousands

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,600
of points of

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,720
14 or 16 bit pixel depth and stream that

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,799
real time across

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,559
networks it just wouldn't make sense so

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,799
being able to do that on the edge

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,880
becomes uh essential for a lot of our

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,960
customers

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:28,240
so as we look at the last slide here um

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,840
kind of key benefits for our customers

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,559
you know i mentioned quite a few of

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,039
these but just to kind of recap them

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,200
really the the core is to help them

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,440
lower integration costs this is making

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,600
it

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,840
again plug and play with how they work

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,760
uh empowering no code engineers i think

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,440
i heard that terminology the first time

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,679
from tom recently but

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,720
makes a lot of sense uh in the past if

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,360
you wanted to

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,399
to do some custom work you had to really

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,320
know how to program and use our sdk

00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:00,960
via fledge we now make that an easier um

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,200
or available to people that may not

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,960
necessarily be deep software

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,200
programmers and then being able to move

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,040
from data to decision support so

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,000
a couple more benefits here but really

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,919
uh our evolution and how we think in our

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,240
solution that we offer to the market is

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,480
driven by these customer needs

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,599
and uh fledge is an essential part to

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,240
that as well as our

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,480
partnership with diana so i'll stop

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,480
there

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,560
thanks chris our pit

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,359
thank you thank you chris and

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,159
tom uh there are a few questions if you

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,639
uh want to

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,440
address them right away yeah well the

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,240
ones on the

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,919
gpus i'm absolutely running uh

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,280
especially computer vision out on the

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,879
edge so we've

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,040
got applications where we're using

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,879
google coral which is the tpu and we

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,879
have other examples where we did digital

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,960
twins for honda's pro racing team

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,399
using uh xavier of course which is the

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,079
nvidia product

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,520
so uh in those kind of workloads

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,760
absolutely

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,640
that hardware is helpful yeah i think

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,520
the question was

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,440
what do you see the role of xpu's to be

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,920
so thank you for the answer

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,640
also uh do you see process control

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,480
implement

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,119
controls at the edge any different from

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,480
the old school you know pid controls

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,520
and uh what's your

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,359
with flair yeah well in fledge's case

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,680
we're not real time control we're on

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,440
really

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,359
very not really we're on any variant of

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,839
linux so linux is where we run on

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,839
but it is bi-directional so if you have

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,520
something that's you know

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,040
slight sub-second you definitely have

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,320
bi-directional data and can send

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,839
commands both direction

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,160
but it's not intended to be the next

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,359
generation plc

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,480
got it and then finally

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,920
is this more secure uh you know the

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,560
general question

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,000
yeah the general answer is well it uses

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,000
linux so we use

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,160
elements on a per data stream so you're

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,160
using https and ssl

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,240
you can use the root of trust that you

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,000
want usually the north or south

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,920
connection might have its own security

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,800
so for instance a pi server uses

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,880
kerberos

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,839
so you need to issue your token from the

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,960
pi server to connect to that securely

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,880
opc ua which is an emerging protocol and

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,800
especially in factory plcs

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,560
it has its own security definition so

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,960
you would use the security of opc

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,800
ua and you would use kerberos to talk to

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,000
pi and you'd use your root of trust and

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,359
send the data to microsoft

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,079
excellent very good well thank you

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,880
very much uh tom and chris this was

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,359
amazing

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,800
so we really appreciate you doing this

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,240
on us so

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,280
uh thank you thank you all right

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,880
okay all right let's

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,119
uh you know one thing i want to

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,880
emphasize here is

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,920
that you know we had

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,440
last year people were like presenting is

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,640
edge real

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,240
is uh you know how big is it what kind

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,839
of applications

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,240
and what a what a difference a year

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,320
makes you know today we're talking about

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,640
actual implementation and deployments

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,520
with very specific use cases and end

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,839
users

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,960
building off open source projects this

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,800
is the power on

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,000
speed of innovation in open source so

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,800
we're really excited

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,400
and you will see lots of examples coming

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,800
up throughout the

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,880
open networking and edge executive forum

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,560
uh that will

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,000
you know highlight some of these use

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,720
cases so

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,079
again thank you i i do know there might

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,400
be more questions coming in

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,079
we'll probably answer them offline uh

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
but let's move on to

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,200
our next presentation and you know

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,040
moving from

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,560
all the way at the edge and iot and all

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,720
the industrials

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,920
to cloud right and you know we'll be

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,560
toggling between

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,760
you know iot edge cloud enterprise

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,440
telecom

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,000
uh throughout the presentations just to

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,079
keep you you know on your toes

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,200
uh but let me introduce the next

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,720
presentation

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,040
uh we have uh uh george nazi who is the

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,960
global vp uh

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,720
for telco media and entertainment

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,119
industry uh

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,800
at google and google cloud and then we

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,680
have a mall footke who is the managing

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,839
director

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,440
for the global telecom industry solution

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,960
at google cloud

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,800
i think both of these folks are

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,480
well known there is no introduction

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,440
needed they have

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,119
not only influenced the telecom and

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,520
cloud industry for the last

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,960
i know 30 years sorry to you know age

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,280
you folks but

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,640
uh they have really made a big dent in

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,640
the last couple of years

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,680
by allowing the collaboration between

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,480
telecom and cloud to come together and

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,160
instead of

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,680
you know three years ago where you know

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,480
it was competing

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,200
uh we are now in a collaboration spirit

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,839
and that has

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,280
really uh spun off all of these

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,240
activities across

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,520
the industry so with that uh i'm gonna

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,880
hand it over to

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,760
george uh for talking about

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,040
you know how he sees the world and 2021

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,760
specifically

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,599
in the multi-cloud era specifically you

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,320
know and and obviously you know with a

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,640
google

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,520
uh view of the world and then of course

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,119
we'll take

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,990
questions amala and i will be chatting

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:26,800
as well

00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:29,839
[Music]

george nazi

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,920
i am the vice president of telco media

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,359
and entertainment industry solutions at

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,640
google cloud

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,079
and i'm here today to talk about how

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,040
google is partnering with the

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,920
communications service providers

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,240
to accelerate their growth and help them

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,440
transform into digital services

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,319
companies let's go to the next slide

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,599
where we cover the topics for today as

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,000
we all know

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,079
we're living in disruptive times and the

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,960
importance of service providers

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,599
have really come home they have truly

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,480
become

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,000
the information fabric of everything we

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,640
are doing

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,920
so today i want to spend time with you

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,000
to cast

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,839
a spotlight on the communications

00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,920
industry

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,119
highlight the challenges and

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,119
opportunities

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,400
that the csps face and share with you

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,480
how google cloud is accelerating the csp

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,599
transformation

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,599
let's go to the next slide

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,520
let us look at this from an industry

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,440
perspective first

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,240
because we're seeing an epic disruption

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,280
so where are we today communication

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,920
service providers

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,440
around the world are facing similar

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,839
challenges

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,400
which have only been amplified by the

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,839
covet 19 pandemic

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,400
let's look at the following five

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:41,839
challenges the first one

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,880
is stagnating top-line revenue growth

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,520
so even before the pandemic csps have

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,359
faced

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,240
stagnating revenue growth in 2019

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,599
the csp revenue was projected to rise by

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,520
one percent

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,040
which is actually a decrease from the

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,480
three percent

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:04,480
growth that was achieved the year before

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,400
and while csps responded extremely well

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,440
to the pandemic

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,640
research shows that 92 percent

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,119
of customers say that their csp

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,720
exceeded expectations in managing the

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,160
crisis

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,000
and the demand for the csps core product

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,560
which is connectivity increased by 70

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,560
percent

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,960
in data usage unfortunately

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,000
the csps have not been able to translate

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,440
usage demand

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,240
into revenue and as we look

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,319
ahead we continue to see challenging

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,280
economic conditions

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,640
which will pace further pressures on the

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,880
csps

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,560
and many operators are now expecting

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,599
revenue under performance

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:56,000
of two to five percent compared

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:59,440
to their pre pre-pandemic plans

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,640
the second challenge increasing

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,760
capex investments to build out future

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,160
networks

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,119
without a clear business case for

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,480
monetization

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,760
especially in the 5g world now in a

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,440
typical operator

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,440
a one percent hit in revenue requires

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,560
a four to eight percent reduction in

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,599
capex to offset that

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,319
let's think about that against the

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,200
backdrop

00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,040
of revenue stagnation are increases in

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,000
capital expenditures

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,880
as operators continue to upgrade their

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,160
4g

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,000
lte networks while also rolling out

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,480
5g networks on 5g alone

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,119
network built out costs are projected to

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,800
reach

00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:51,440
872 billion over the next

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:54,480
10 years third challenge

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,200
increased network demand at the same

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,760
time

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,400
amidst the pandemic all of us have been

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,240
working

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,079
studying socializing working from home

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,880
and the result is increasing pressure on

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,720
the network in fact

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,079
fixed and mobile operators have

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,839
experienced as much

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,720
as 60 more internet traffic

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,520
than before the outbreak highlighting

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,520
the ever

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,280
increasing need for resilience and

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,599
scalability of the network

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,400
fourth challenge the customer experience

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,680
is really at the breaking point

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,079
now although 92 percent of customers say

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,960
their csp exceeded expectations in

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,280
managing

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:43,040
covet 19 csps have still historically

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,240
performed poorly in customer experience

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,200
in fact in the last five years

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,800
no leading telecommunications cable or

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,599
satellite company

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,359
in the americas or europe has sustained

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,319
a net promoter score

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,680
and that promoter is the measure of

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,480
customer loyalty

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,560
none of them have managed a score above

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,079
50 percent

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,960
a threshold that indicates a company

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,319
is beloved so none of them have been

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,359
able to kind of

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,640
score above 50. the fifth challenge is

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,000
the new ways of working

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,839
and collaborating according to bcg

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,920
40 of employees will utilize remote

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,839
working models in the future

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,280
which will also require csps to continue

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:36,640
to reinvent how their employees engage

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,640
and collaborate remotely let's go to the

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,000
next slide

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,640
i just covered it from an industry

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,240
perspective let us look at this

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,440
from a ceo perspective and look at the

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,880
top challenges

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,800
the communication ceos face

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,640
so in the face of these disruptive

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,200
headwinds in the industry

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,200
ceos and their teams across every part

00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,520
of the csp organization are searching

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,280
for

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,599
ways to overcome these challenges

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,119
and are asking the following five or six

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,839
questions

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,280
how do i create new network enabled

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,680
revenue streams

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,720
how do i expand transform and operate

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,520
the network

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,560
so that it profitably handle explosive

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,920
usage

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:24,319
how do i cost effectively delight

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,440
customers and how do they want to engage

00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,319
with us

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,319
how do i continuously innovate the

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,400
customer experience

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:35,359
how do i effectively manage my

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,359
increasing complex systems and processes

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,680
and how do i evolve my workforce to

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,560
thrive with agility

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,079
with innovation and with collaboration

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,040
and as you see

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,119
below each of these big questions there

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,040
are a series of other questions

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,200
actually they are answers but these

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,480
answers could also be questions

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,560
for instance how do i monetize 5g how do

00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,880
i evolve to an sdn and autonomous

00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,319
operations how do i deliver personalized

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,720
experience at scale

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,440
or stronger customer loyalty how do i

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,200
utilize

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,000
analytics and ai to enhance customer

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,960
experience

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,560
how do i build agility monetize my i.t

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,160
state and make my workforce

00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,359
more productive and innovative

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,520
let's go to the next slide now with

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,559
disruption and challenges

00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,599
come opportunities and google cloud

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:32,400
is hyper focused on helping csps

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,760
not only transform but to accelerate

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,000
their growth

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,400
to accelerate their competitiveness and

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,079
to accelerate their digital journey

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:45,680
and i believe we truly bring a number of

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:49,520
unique attributes to our partnerships

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,760
let me list six of them the first one

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,200
is really about network and security

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,240
leadership

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,720
did you know that google cloud operates

00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,880
on one of the best connected and fastest

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,200
networks on the planet

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,040
we share the same infrastructure and

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,960
global network that powers google

00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,079
products like youtube

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,880
stadia gmail it's one of the largest

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,839
privately owned networks and our

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,960
infrastructure

00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:20,079
is protected by experts in information

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,920
application and network security why is

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,160
this important you might ask

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,839
because it helps our customers connect

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,599
to their end users

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:31,920
no matter where they are in the world

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,480
second it's the solutions that support

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,400
hybrid and multi-cloud strategies

00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,480
through anthos we empower the csps

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,240
and the developer community ecosystems

00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,040
to seamlessly build

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,079
and scale new applications across any

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,119
environment

00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,359
whether it's modernizing the core i.t

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,319
systems running the network management

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,480
functions

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:58,400
or deploying 5g and edge applications

00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,839
our multi-cloud and hybrid cloud

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,720
solutions

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,839
let csps build and run their

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,200
applications

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:09,599
wherever it makes sense with no vendor

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,599
lock-in

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:16,960
thirdly open source why do we do this

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,760
google cloud is committed to an open

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,640
environment

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,480
and we have used the ethos to build our

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,359
csb solutions

00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,599
as you know we've invested in kubernetes

00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,760
and

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,800
open sourced it we are a platinum member

00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,800
of the linux

00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:38,960
foundation networking number four data

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:42,079
leadership google is also a leader

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,680
at storing processing and analyzing data

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,760
at scale

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,520
we are leaders in applying machine

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,599
learning and ai

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,040
in innovative ways in our consumer

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,119
products

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,119
we have tailored our ai and machine

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,680
learning capabilities to solve

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,359
real business challenges such as

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,559
improving customer care

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:05,599
while lowering operational costs

00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,640
we've also utilized ai to help automate

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,800
and optimize

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:14,400
how we run the network in a lean way

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,200
number five expensive ecosystem of

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,280
partners

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,680
we embrace collaboration with partners

00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,119
from large established partners to new

00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,040
innovative ones

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,520
we have a rich ecosystem of partners

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:28,240
that just keeps growing

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,040
and number six finally we bring the best

00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,200
of google

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,160
we leverage alphabet and google's assets

00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,800
and capabilities

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,839
to bring the very best of google to help

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,839
csps

00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:41,359
digitally transform let's go to the next

00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:43,040
slide

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:45,119
in addition to bringing the very best of

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,359
google to our customers

00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,440
we are hyper focused at an industry

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,400
level and have developed a comprehensive

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,480
portfolio of csp specific solutions

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,000
to help service providers accelerate

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,760
their growth

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,280
our solutions are focused on helping

00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,160
csps transform

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,359
in four key business areas monetizing

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,599
the edge

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,440
engaging customers with data-driven

00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,800
digital experience

service provider network evolution and

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,280
monetizing core systems and workforce

00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,280
let's go to the next slide

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,680
i also want to focus on our ecosystem

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,520
at google cloud we recognize that it

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,319
takes a village to bring about tangible

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,520
change

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:33,280
and we truly embrace collaboration

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:35,520
our partners include oss and bss vendors

00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,640
collaboration and technology vendors

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,920
network equipment

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:43,680
providers global system integrators

00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,359
technology vendors and edge isv partners

00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,280
and i'm excited about google cloud's

00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,960
commitment to continue to grow our

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,599
partner ecosystem

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,440
in fact at the end of last year we

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,000
announced that we are teaming up with 30

00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,640
plus

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,720
launch partners and popular industry

00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,040
application providers to deliver more

00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,319
than

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,960
200 partner applications at the edge

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:07,440
all on google cloud and all working

00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,119
together to help our csp customers

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:14,079
harness the potential of cloud and 5g

00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,440
let's go to the final slide please i

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,599

joining me today and i hope you enjoyed

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,760
the rest of the forum

00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,680
if you would like to understand more

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,599
about how google is partnering

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,000
with communication service providers and

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:30,880
the broader communications ecosystem

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,960
please contact my colleague amulfat who

00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,640
is also on the linux foundation

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,800
networking governing board

00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,680
and he will be more than happy to answer

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:42,079
any questions

00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,079
you may have thank you very much

00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,480
ah talking about them all right like

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,920
welcome

00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,960
uh and uh again thank you

00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,359
thank you george um i i do want to sort

00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,599
of

00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,400
highlight the fact that you know your

00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,839
your vision

00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,839
of laying out the challenges what google

00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,559
cloud and google have done to support

00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,680
that

00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,680
and then how you're building an

00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,920
ecosystem to

00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,400
accelerate the adoption you know very

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,119
very fantastically laid out

00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,400
so while i also have them all here uh

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,520
you know we do want to

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,240
kind of take it one level uh deeper and

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,319
kind of ask

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,160
uh questions that have come been coming

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:25,520
in uh specifically

00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,160
uh you know what are your thoughts on

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,160
kind of the multi-cloud strategy as you

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,400
know some of the telcos are putting

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,800
uh de facto open source projects like

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,680
odap uh for for orchestration and

00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,920
automation

00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,000
and then they sit underneath like a

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,160
google cloud with uh anthos and things

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
like that so in general maybe

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,160
maybe you know utilize some of those

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,920
questions

00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,760
absolutely so first of all nice to be

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,960
here nice to see you again and nice to

00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,480
see the team

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,000
excellent conference and i'm looking

00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,640
forward to hearing some great feedback

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,960
on that

00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,720
to answer your specific point out with

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,440
as george said

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,480
we have really started looking at an

00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,839
antos based multi-cloud strategy

00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,920
and for us anthos is more than just a

00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,920
sort of software orchestration there

00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,160
right it's about combining

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,160
the whole journey to cloud native arbit

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,640
that we see happening over the next

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,400
two to three years and that cloud native

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,319
journey already started in the i.t

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,480
world and is now really getting

00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:28,079
accelerated in the network

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,559
so as that happens we fully expect to

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,599
work

00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,160
very closely with other members already

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,319
on

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,440
lfn and connect but also others that are

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,040
about to join

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,720
because ultimately they are all trying

00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,400
to do the same thing which is hey how

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,359
can we help the end

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,960
clients the csp clients to radically

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,880
transform the way they look at network

00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,880
and id systems right so

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,000
for us the move to cloud native will act

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,200
as an accelerant

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,400
and that's where own app other projects

00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,799
under lfn

00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,599
the edge project under lfn and so on and

00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,599
so forth

00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,880
would actually uh give us tremendous

00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,520
value

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,680
because we are expecting pretty much all

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,240
of those to get onboarded

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,799
in a sort of cloud-native world so that

00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,680
that really is our main ethos

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,640
very good very good uh again for those

00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,799
of you who are

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,880
who joined us late i had mentioned you

00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:20,400
know there's a q a button on the right

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,720
hand side of your chat so look

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,839
please please send them over uh there

00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,799
are a few questions

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,359
on more high-level strategy on google

00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,319
cloud

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,640
is it becoming you know less of a

00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,160
hyper-scale cloud platform and more of a

00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,119
network service provider

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:40,559
or is it a you know augmented strategy

00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:43,040
on on kind of doing both

00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,559
i see definitely not a network service

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,280
provider we basically

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,720
want to collaborate with our csv clients

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,839
and partners and friends and they are

00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,520
the ones who are ultimately going to

00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,559
offer network services

00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,520
think of our cloud platform as george

00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,280
described

00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,720
is something that we built over the last

00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,880
two decades to support

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,079
all of the google first party services

00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,960
right whether it's

00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,079
search or email and others and as we

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,440
build those

00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,359
we actually solved a lot of the problems

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,599
that happen when you drive applications

00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:15,119
at scale in a cloud native world

00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,640
so it was actually more about how hey

00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,079
can we externalize all of that

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,760
innovation that google has developed

00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,760
over the last two decades

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,680
work with open source and see if we can

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,559
actually put it in the hands of our csb

00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,480
clients

00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,599
for them to then monetize their

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,760
infrastructure

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,880
as well as transform their networks so

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,720
it's all about

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,400
giving the infrastructure with our edge

00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,640
compute and our amphors

00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,400
and ultimately let service providers

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,319
degrade what applications and services

00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,200
they want to put on top

00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:44,000
yep i think in the main in a similar

00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,160
there's a similar

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,040
question but a slightly different nuance

00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,200
which is

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,880
is your network connectivity private

00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,200
meaning guaranteed

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,280
or using the public internet protocols

00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,680
to achieve the us or is it a hybrid and

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,960
i think

00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,200
uh you know go ahead yes so so as far as

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,000
our core network is concerned

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,760
we absolutely have this uh at a

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,559
guaranteed level because obviously the

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,240
cloud

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,000
applications that are running are fairly

00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,079
mission critical in many cases so we

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,599
absolutely guarantee very stringent sl

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,240
is there

00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,920
now when it comes to access to our cloud

00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,760
whether it's through interconnects or

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,640
through partner networks obviously that

00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,480
uses

00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,000
whichever protocols that are out there

00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,280
you know we ourselves have our own

00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,680
products that allow us

00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,240
people to connect securely to our cloud

00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,000
but then we'll also partner with csps

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,319
and you know we are already having other

00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,480
technologies like sd-wan and so on

00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,920
that are used as connectivity mechanisms

00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,160
to get into the cloud

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,599
but once you're on the cloud we have the

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,640
largest privately owned

00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,000
infrastructure planet-wide and we

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,880
basically leverage that into it okay

00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,480
very good i got a couple more uh what is

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,280
your support for

00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,359
cnfs or cloud native network functions

00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,000
and multi-connectivity

00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,559
i think it's in the timeline of you know

00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,599
onap

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,000
or anthos with cnf extraction but

00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,599
you know might as well repeat that

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,440
absolutely absolutely and

00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,680
the as george described we are our

00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,319
ecosystem of partners is growing whether

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,640
it's edge

00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,440
partners there is about 30 of them that

00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,799
have now got

00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,440
on-boarded on and those um

00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:23,680
we have also looked at specific partners

00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,960
like nokia that we announced publicly a

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,720
couple of months ago

00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,119
and we are actually working with them

00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,520
for their cloud native 5g core functions

00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,040
to get on board and there is a lot more

00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,400
in the pipeline our page so there's some

00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,240
exciting announcements to follow in the

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,720
next few months very good

00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,680
and we'll just have to look at it all

00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,079
right uh

00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,359
last probably we have time for one more

00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,720
question which is

00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:50,000
uh you know csps have definitely

00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:53,680
our poo challenges does google

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,400
uh help uh increase their rpool or

00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,839
give some roi you know specifically

00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,880
because you know obviously it's built on

00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,000
open source now

00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,599
george could answer it or you could

00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,839
answer that i think you're on a roll so

00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,480
just go ahead

00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:08,240
i think it's basically three things one

00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,480
we definitely help them drive

00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,559
our tool by offering them edge solutions

00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,720
on our edge compute platforms

00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,720
and that's where they can really build

00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,880
you know retail manufacturing specific

00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,480
vertical solutions to improve r2

00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,480
but then we also have our ai

00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,799
capabilities and analytics that help

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,359
them drive customer experience

00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,640
that then ultimately also drives rpo and

00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,160
then finally the whole

00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,640
open source and first driven

00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,559
capabilities are very important for them

00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,920
to radically transform the tco as far as

00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,359
networks and ltf

00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,280
so that's the three ways in which you

00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:43,119
would help i think yeah

00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:45,760
got you okay so maybe one more

00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,640
uh yep i think jill's saying one more

00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,240
all right

00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,480
uh so are you reviving uh verticals to

00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:55,200
run on google platforms

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,160
uh and and in general what's the

00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,240
assurance that

00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:02,400
uh cloud platform providers will kind of

01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,760
not withdraw the vertical efforts that

01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,760
typically goes on on

01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,920
apis and things like that i think it's a

01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,119
longer question but uh

01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,440
effectively how much vertical support

01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,520
uh you know how much of a vertical

01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,160
market support whether it's apis or

01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,559
whatever

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,920
is is envisioned in the bigger schema of

01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,000
things

01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,040
we absolutely remain committed to that i

01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,960
don't think there's any

01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,559
strategic intent to sort of move away

01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,640
from that if anything

01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,440
the whole notion behind anthos multi

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:34,160
cloud was to open up an api

01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,079
uh platform for partners to come and

01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,920
innovate on top right so definitely

01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,920
there is no intent at all to move away

01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,480
and then of course rpg we can take it

01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,200
offline as a longer conversation yep

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,240
exactly

01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:48,240
very nice awesome man you could answer

01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,319
like so and thank you by the way the

01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,599
uh you know we have a huge number of

01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,440
people online so

01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,240
we are really excited about everybody

01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,920
joining and asking these questions uh

01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,760
it's a rare opportunity you know trust

01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,839
me i've been on several

01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,119
conferences virtually and you know we

01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:06,000
don't get a chance to answer

01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,520
ask questions to the topic so you know

01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,640
don't miss this opportunity and

01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,000
you know if they don't know they don't

01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,920
know right like they don't know

01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,400
everything

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,079
all right so uh george and amol thank

01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,720
you very much for doing this

01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,920
i really appreciate your support with

01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,480
the open source

01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,640
uh ecosystem in general open source

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,799
projects under networking and edge

01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,480
and thank you for doing this thank you

01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,640
for having us up it was a pleasure thank

01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,640
you

01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,079
all right so we moved to the you know

01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,520
from cloud

01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:41,920
back on the edge and we have a very

01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,880
exciting you know you know uh

01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,040
presentation

01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,280
uh or i would say a fireside chat right

01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,920
where uh we're gonna discuss

01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,040
uh edge application and iot application

01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,200
on how do you take

01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,880
you know say cloud networking concepts

01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,799
and and thoughts into an edge

01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,400
or a distributed edge like moving all

01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:02,799
the way into

01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:05,839
sort of a closer to the application

01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:08,640
so we have the next speakers we have uh

01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,960
syed uh also who is the ceo and founder

01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,160
of

01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,000
a company called zedera and

01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,760
uh they are one of the contributors of

01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,880
project eve and we have

01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,240
uh steve mulleney who i think everybody

01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,079
should know he's the

01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:27,760
you know ceo and president of uh miatrex

01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:30,559
uh as a as a end user so without

01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:33,119
further ado we're going to have uh saeed

01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:36,319
and steve walk us through

01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,960
some of the priorities challenges uses

01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,599
uh and and kind of how they managed to

01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,720
get this

01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:48,440
going in the open source world so take

01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:52,459
it on side

01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,459
[Music]

01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,960
all right excited to be here today my

01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,000
name is syed busal

01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,000
uh the ceo uh and founder of zedita

01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,520
um so with me today steve mullaney uh

01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,240
i'll let steve introduce himself in a

01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,760
second but

01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,440
uh maybe a few words for the folks that

01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,200
don't know our company's adidas we're an

01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,119
edge orchestration company that is

01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,280
addressing the distributed edge

01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,400
um our product is partially based on

01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,440
open source and we'll talk a little bit

01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,880
about that today

01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,119
and enabling customers to make edge

01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,559
computing effortless uh distributed edge

01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,559
as we will go talk about that in

01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,160
fireside today it's basically

01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,839
any edge computing outside of your

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,480
traditional data center environment

01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:30,079
very close to iot devices and sensors so

01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,799
we've seen our key verticals being in

01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,440
industrial

01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:35,359
energy retail and telco a high number

01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,039
remote distributed locations processing

01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,079
a lot of data before they send it off to

01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,680
the cloud

01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,520
um and as arpat mentioned we're a

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,640
founding member of lfeds we donated

01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,079
project eve

01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,000
for the ones who are not fully familiar

01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,839
with eve eve is a lightweight secure

01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,200
open source edge operating system that's

01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:51,200
based on linux

01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,119
it's not a distro it's probably the

01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,720
opposite it's a very opinionated modeler

01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,599
stack we took out everything that we

01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,319
felt

01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,760
didn't fit in the edge and focus a lot

01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,760
on security

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,079
and basically trying to build here what

01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,559
people call the android of the edge

01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,440
um so edge computing is an extension of

01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,520
the cloud

01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,200
we see customers basically process data

01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,359
before they send it off to the cloud

01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,480
and therefore networking to the cloud is

01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,079
very important and that's why i'm here

01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,960
today with steve mullaney who's the ceo

01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,240
and founder and

01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:23,359
president of aviatrix yeah

01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,760
you must introduce yourself yeah so uh

01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,520
before we get on tom arthur who i knew

01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,440
from the very early days of

01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,200
uh client server when he was at novell

01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,839
and brought up that yeah

01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,760
you you're a synoptics guy so you know i

01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:38,880
i was an ethernet engineer before ten

01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,359
base t so i know what csma cd means

01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,160
um so i've been in networking for 35

01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:44,079
years

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,480
and i've seen the last great you know

01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,240
the last transformation of mainframe to

01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,920
client server you know we rode that the

01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,000
last uh 30 years

01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,079
and then um i've had a great career i

01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,119
was at palo alto very early i was

01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,160
the ceo of nasira with martin casado we

01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,039
created obs

01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,920
the open v switch um and we ended up

01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,920
becoming part of

01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,599
vmware and so kind of rode that that

01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,359
that wave and then

01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,640
you know saeed i retired i was done i

01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,880
was never gonna work again

01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,240
and for about five years i i i was

01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,559
living the dream

01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,280
and this thing called cloud brought me

01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,920
back

01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,440
at aviatrix and i saw that you know

01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,680
about two years ago

01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,880
i said okay every enterprise about seven

01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,640
years ago

01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,400
said okay we're gonna move to cloud for

01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,400
five years they did nothing

01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,920
and i noticed about two years ago they

01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,280
all on the same because they moved like

01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,839
a herd they all decided

01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,200
okay now we're actually moving the cloud

01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,760
and i said my god

01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,760
um the transformation is happening um

01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,960
this is going to be 10 times bigger than

01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,640
client server it's going to happen a

01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,599
thousand times faster because it's all

01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,240
software

01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,799
um and the center of gravity two years

01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,119
ago

01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:50,160
completely flipped from being on-prem to

01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,720
in the cloud

01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,400
and um first thing people do this is how

01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,359
networking works is you fix the core

01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,720
first

01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:58,720
and then it moves out to the edge that's

01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,240
how it works it does you don't you don't

01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,960
fix the edge first you fix the core

01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,480
first

01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,000
the core is cloud and it's going to

01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,319
start moving out and that's that's why

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,359
i'm excited to be um to be working with

01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,680
you and and

01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,280
and um you know as as the world starts

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,280
moving out to the edge

01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,200
great well we got a couple topics today

01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,920
to go through one is uh of obviously

01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,400
open source

01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,440
uh second thing is is cloud love to kind

01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,680
of you know talk a little bit through

01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,000
more on that then networking in between

01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,599
clouds and then finally to the edge

01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,200
let's start with open source steve what

01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,839
what are your thoughts on open source

01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,559
what

01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:32,079
uh you obviously obs uh was uh you know

01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,440
you guys contributed and created that

01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,640
early day but what's your thoughts on

01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,000
open source and how it relates to

01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,280
standardization you know

01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,680
uh you know martine was was famous for

01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,480
this

01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,880
and and insertion is nine tenths of of

01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,960
of

01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,799
of the law right and you've got to

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,039
insert and when you're at the edge

01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,000
um you can't come in with a proprietary

01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,200
thing in

01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,520
many times so so that's why we created

01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,520
obs um and it was you know very

01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,799
successful way of networking out at the

01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,599
edge and i think you're doing a very

01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,920
similar thing with

01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,440
even and so forth and you look at the

01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,920
distributed ads that you're you know

01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,880
this is

01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,240
millions of sites um people don't want a

01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,079
proprietary

01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:14,880
stack that locks them in into somebody's

01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,680
hardware so you know open source gives

01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,000
you

01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,359
gives you that choice and that insertion

01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,039
particularly at the edge where the

01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,720
numbers tend to get massive

01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,039
that that's at least what what what i've

01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,880
seen and we saw it at this era

01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,559
yeah yeah i mean i think one of the

01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,640
things that i find interesting because

01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,240
maybe i have not 35 years but you know a

01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,720
little bit less but still a long time i

01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,400
think

01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,359
when i started networking everything was

01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,559
about ietf rfcs and ieee standards and

01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,920
everything had to be sort of

01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,680
very well specced especially if you

01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,319
wanted interoperability

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,039
and to me it feels like with open source

01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,400
we basically

01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,720
write the code rather than writing the

01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,319
spec the code becomes the spec

01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,240
in some way i think open source has

01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:54,720
replaced a lot of the

01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,359
traditional uh you know standardization

01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,359
efforts

01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:59,359
um and and probably enhanced

01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,880
interoperability to your point uh where

01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,559
it becomes easier now

01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,839
you use ovs everywhere you use it you

01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:05,200
know you're going to probably it's going

01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:07,119
to work right it doesn't matter who

01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,520
leverages obs in their specific product

01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:12,559
for instance

01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,799
i agree i agree so you know in terms of

01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,480
aviatrix and and the work you guys have

01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:18,159
been doing it has been a lot about cloud

01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,560
networking can you maybe spend a minute

01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:20,880
just

01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,600
talking about what what's the problem we

01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,359
solved in

01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,040
for networking in the cloud you know

01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,520
obviously the cloud providers have also

01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,600
networking capabilities uh built so

01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,520
what is it that you you're seeing as you

01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,480
talk to customers that that aviators can

01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,239
bring to the table

01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,679
so i think the thing that i see the most

01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:37,359
is this this is a business

01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,080
transformation this is not

01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,960
a bottoms-up transformation um this is

01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,239
where the

01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,319
business the ceo the board says we are

01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:47,679
going to digitally transform because we

01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,440
have an existential threat to the

01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,759
survival of our company

01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,640
fear of death is a pretty big motivator

01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,719
for people

01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,319
and it took them a while and they talked

01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,440
about eventually they said we have got

01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,759
to move to the cloud

01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:01,359
and when that happened you know you know

01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,199
the way i t people think it's all about

01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,719
architecture and it's all about where is

01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:07,120
your center of architecture

01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,839
and and and and the center of gravity of

01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,480
architecture

01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:11,359
two years ago flipped from being on-prem

01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,679
center of gravity

01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,839
to in the cloud once that happens cloud

01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,319
becomes an investment on-prem becomes

01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:19,199
an expense expenses go down by a factor

01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,040
of 10

01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:22,799
investments go up by factor 10 and then

01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,920
once you define what your architecture

01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:26,239
is what do you do

01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,319
you push it everywhere you don't want

01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:30,159
five different architectures

01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,080
when we switched from mainframe to

01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:34,319
client server and that became the

01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,920
strategic architecture mainframes were

01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,279
quarantined off in the corner

01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,040
same thing's happening right now it

01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,279
happened two years ago um

01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,799
and then the first thing they fix is is

01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,719
at the core

01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:46,400
and that's where we we kind of fit you

01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,640
know with aviatrixes

01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,679
is everyone went to the they thought it

01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,600
was initially it was

01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,359
all about you know coming at it almost

01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,839
from like an sd-wan conversation which

01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,360
is like

01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,960
so the cloud service providers would

01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,480
this is what they would tell enterprises

01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,840
is we do everything and anything you'll

01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,719
ever need for networking and network

01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,159
security

01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,320
and the enterprise go oh my god that's

01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,600
wonderful that's so good so all i got to

01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,640
do is get there and then everything's

01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,640
taken care of

01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,880
all inclusive baby all you got to do is

01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,199
get there oh this is fantastic and then

01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,520
they get there and then they realize

01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,640
like all all inclusive things there's

01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,560
one sailboat

01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:23,920
one surfboard you know one one one mask

01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,560
to snorkel you know a buffet with shitty

01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,120
food

01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,320
you know and they go this is not at all

01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,960
like the brochure

01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,239
right we've all been there that's what

01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,360
the clouds is like

01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:38,560
is it's crap and so it's

01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,679
it's basic level services a lot of

01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,000
complexity

01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,199
nowhere near like the brochure and the

01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,800
enterprise goes there and they go oh my

01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,440
god and it gets even worse now all of a

01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,199
sudden

01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,560
i'm in multiple clouds because the

01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,360
business decides what clouds are going

01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,760
to be in not

01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,679
not not me as i.t so i got all this

01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,840
complexity all the clouds are different

01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,000
i've got half the staff because my

01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,920
leadership said oh it's cloud it's easy

01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,840
um and so they go in and they realize

01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,320
and and by the way the boat's burned on

01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:07,440
prem so that no going back

01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,760
and i'm in here and and now what do i do

01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,600
and so i want the devops mentality i

01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,159
want the automation i want to terraform

01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,920
everything

01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:15,840
i want the simplicity and the agility of

01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,760
cloud of cloud native

01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,159
but yet i need the visibility and the

01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,080
operational controls security controls

01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,840
performance controls day two

01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,800
troubleshooting that i had on prem

01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,280
because

01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,800
i'm being white melon i'm like a

01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,520
government for god's sake not even a

01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,840
bank

01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,199
so it's not just willy-nilly spin things

01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,679
up in the cloud run around

01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:36,640
naked drinking tequila i have controls

01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,320
that i have to have

01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,920
how do i get the combination of both of

01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,280
that you can't get it from the cloud

01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,239
service providers you can't get it from

01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,920
the existing

01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:45,360
on-prem networking vendors you have to

01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,560
go to somebody who's cloud native but

01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,920
also understands

01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,000
the visibility and control that you need

01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,159
that's aviatrix excellent

01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,600
thank you awesome well let's talk a bit

01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:56,080
about the rise of edge computing

01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,360
um you know i think from my perspective

01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,800
i'd love to get your thoughts too i mean

01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,320
what we've been seeing as we talked to

01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,600
customers and i think tom arthur also

01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,760
mentioned this a little bit is that you

01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,440
know the in the in the cloud-borne and

01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,679
in the traditional workloads

01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,280
the processing of your data and the

01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,679
storage of your data in one location

01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,360
right

01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,880
you you generate the data in the cloud

01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,640
you process it in the data

01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,239
and you store it in the cloud what we've

01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,640
been seeing as part of

01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:19,600
edge is that the data generation part is

01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,080
moving to the edge of the network

01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,120
cameras sensors devices all these things

01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,480
are getting there

01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,239
and you know i think you and i talked

01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,719
about this in the early days of zedita

01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,320
too

01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,719
is i think it's almost like the network

01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,480
traffic is flipping um and you know we

01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,159
used to have a very download-centric

01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,960
world where we consume video and we

01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,040
consume

01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,480
information on our mobile devices but as

01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,080
soon as you start generating tremendous

01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,600
amount of data at the edge

01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,840
uh you can't upload it to the cloud so

01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,679
we've seen this this desire to prove

01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,280
processing out to the to the edge i

01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,040
don't know any thoughts you have there

01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,320
and how you've seen these trends in the

01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,239
past yeah

01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:54,400
we see the same thing and again

01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,800
enterprises run workloads where they run

01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,880
best

01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,920
and and and they'll they'll bring the

01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,080
infrastructure

01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,840
to where the data is exactly as you said

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,679
if i'm generating lots of data

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,880
in a distributed area guess what i'm

01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,159
going to bring the compute i'm going to

01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,280
bring the storage i'm going to bring the

01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,719
networking there

01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,040
i'm not going to bring the data to where

01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,159
the other stuff is why because it just

01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,120
does it does not get it's not going to

01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,480
have the latency it's not going to

01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,480
performance it's not going to have all

01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,520
the things that that it needs to have

01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:22,239
so i definitely see that and i see

01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,800
kind of cloud mentality moving out to

01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,880
these

01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,159
to these to these edge points and having

01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,280
that architecture

01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:31,440
but absolutely i people are going to run

01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,719
put infrastructure where it runs best

01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,000
and they're not going to have a single

01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,920
data center they're going to have

01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,679
multiple centers of data that are

01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,159
distributed not just in the core of the

01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,760
cloud

01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,920
but out of the out of the engines as

01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,960
well

01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,400
excellent um you know i think the other

01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,239
thing that um

01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,760
we've seen and obviously we've been

01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,640
working commercially on a few customers

01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,640
as well

01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,800
is that the edge is so diverse right i

01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,800
mean when you touch the iot world it is

01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,719
very fragmented it's not anymore like

01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,920
you can create a little data center one

01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:01,520
common

01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,120
i mean every data center was different

01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,880
but the applications in the data center

01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,159
were probably all the same sap

01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,600
oracle windows sql server i think that

01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,920
the interesting thing with the edge is

01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,520
that

01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,040
in every edge environment you're sort of

01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,400
hitting that iot verticalization

01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,320
fragmentation so

01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,679
customers need different hardware we've

01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,560
seen customers trying to deploy embedded

01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,199
compute

01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,800
gateways even sometimes servers they run

01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:24,400
different types of applications from

01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,440
fledge to edgex to

01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,000
you know azure iot edge green grass and

01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,760
also we're

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,640
seeing um you know different clouds

01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,719
being used uh from that point of view

01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,760
any thoughts you have on how we can

01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,679
connect better

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,280
for the audience the clouds and and the

01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,560
edges you know from from cloud

01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,719
networking point of view

01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,320
i mean we have customers that have 10

01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:47,120
000 bpcs

01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,880
and growing in in in multiple clouds and

01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,840
you know we think okay that's a that's a

01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,320
scale problem

01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,679
but it's actually relatively compared to

01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,000
what you're doing saying with the data

01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,880
it's

01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,679
actually an easier scale problem because

01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,600
these are really

01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:04,480
simple vpcs they're very homogeneous

01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,239
they don't have humans trying to hack

01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,880
into it physically they don't

01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:10,400
have rs232 ports they don't have they're

01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,840
not there's no different hardware we

01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,320
define the instance

01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,000
so it's it's it's actually more very

01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,920
much a cloud way

01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,360
the the issue that you have is you're in

01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,800
that interface between the physical

01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,480
world and the cloud world

01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,000
and that's where all the complexity is

01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,000
you know by the way you you have all the

01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,679
scale but you have all you like you said

01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,280
the difference the different boxes the

01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,159
different sizes the different

01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,840
you know cameras that the ot interface

01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:35,520
to the it world

01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,040
and that's always where things are

01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,400
complex and at the same time you're

01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,600
trying to scale it

01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,800
down to you know raspberry pi

01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:48,400
devices i mean and call them

01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:50,880
super nano data centers i mean and so

01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,000
that is a significant challenge but from

01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,560
an enterprise or from

01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,560
a customer perspective i want that all

01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,040
integrated into one network

01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,040
i don't want multiple architectures i

01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,360
don't i want one architecture

01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,760
i want one network and i want it to

01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,080
seamlessly integrate together

01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,040
all the way down to that absolute

01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,080
exploded

01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,679
nano data center that you're enabling

01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:15,120
but you're right that's where a lot of

01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,120
the complexity is

01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,400
and you need a very flexible platform

01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,840
that can handle

01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,000
all of that because you don't want to

01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,880
have to have 15 different endpoints that

01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,880
you're trying to manage

01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,239
i mean that's it we've all learned from

01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,199
the googles of the world and facebook's

01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:32,640
of the world

01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:34,000
is you know you want consistency and

01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,080
commonality and everything you do

01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,199
that's how you scale it's going to look

01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,560
the same

01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,480
yeah we're going to move from pets to

01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,440
cattle i totally agree so we got a

01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,280
couple of questions

01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,880
came in steve so one for you is uh how

01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,800
can the telecom operators

01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,920
support the uh you know the data

01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,800
wherever it sits what do you think the

01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,719
role that telcos

01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,719
is in this broader scheme

01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,920
um i think 5g is going to be huge uh so

01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,280
i think i think that's going to be

01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,520
a a big play for them yeah

01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,520
you agree i totally agree and that's

01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,520
what we're seeing private 5g and also i

01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,760
think finally the ability to mix

01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,960
private wireless networks with public

01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,800
wireless networks i think that

01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,800
that that coming together is going to be

01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,760
great another question for you

01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,520
um so the question is why do you suppose

01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,159
the center of architecture

01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,719
flip from on-prem to the cloud um you

01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:25,360
know

01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:26,159
what did the what did the cloud guys do

01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,800
did they

01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:31,120
you know under-deliver on their promises

01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,360
at this point or over promised earlier

01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,800
on

01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,719
what happened to have enabled that

01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,920
transition from your point here's why

01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:39,679
so if you went to i-team 10-15 years ago

01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,400
in your business unit and you said hey

01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:43,440
i.t

01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,400
can i they'd say no well i haven't even

01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,960
finished my question

01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,719
it doesn't matter the answer is no well

01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,800
let me answer it okay let me ask

01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,760
okay yeah so okay so the answer and if

01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,080
it isn't no

01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,600
it's what year do you want it in so what

01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,800
do you think the business units did

01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,520
people like me

01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,120
water goes around an obstacle right it

01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,719
hits an obstacle it goes around it

01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,120
that's what it does it seeks the least

01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,120
the

01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,120
resistance so i have a credit card i'm

01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,440
not afraid to use it i'm going aws

01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,520
that's how this whole thing started

01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,719
because it happens in organizations when

01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,400
you keep getting told

01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,840
no and i don't even get to answer the

01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,520
ask the whole question

01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,520
you get going over you go people go

01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:23,040
around you that's what happened

01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,320
and so agility what a customer once told

01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,440
me it was about a year ago it was a

01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,960
great phrase he said

01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:31,520
agility is now part of the definition

01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,199
of mission critical it didn't used to be

01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,239
miscritical meant oh it's gonna take

01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:37,199
years

01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:38,480
no no no it has to be this that that's

01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,640
what changed

01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,719
and that's that's the cloud mentality

01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,440
and and and and so forth and in order to

01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,800
do that

01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,640
you got to you got to go to the cloud

01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,040
and it was a so it was a business

01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,719
decision where the business people drove

01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,600
this as it should be

01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:54,320
it is a service when you when you when i

01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,120
say jump

01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,159
you say how high that's how it should be

01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,719
it shouldn't be no

01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:01,920
it should be no but this is what we

01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,920
should do and oh by the way i want it

01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,320
now that that that's why it that's why

01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,480
it shifted

01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,760
okay so i think we're almost the time

01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,199
here so i think i'll take one more

01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,360
question that um

01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,480
somebody asked to me um the question is

01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,480
how do i we

01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,840
to take on previously local non-cloud

01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,840
connected endpoints like in

01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,600
manufacturing energy etc

01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,679
i've seen those solutions change to

01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,040
cloud native or basically only integrate

01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,080
using gateways and adapt i think that's

01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,000
a great question

01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,360
and so the way the way we've seen it to

01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,520
me it's always been

01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,800
the the future of applications at the

01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,679
edge is cloud native right the

01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,960
applications

01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,640
are going to be written in the cloud

01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,159
they're going to use cloud modern uh

01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,239
technologies like go

01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,440
and you know all the containerization

01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,800
and everything else

01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,400
and i think the challenge really at the

01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,120
edge has been is how do i deploy the

01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,280
software

01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,280
how do i orchestrate deploy and run it

01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,880
so so this is i think the first

01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,800
order problem is really how to make that

01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,320
as easy as in the cloud so in our

01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,640
conversation with customers

01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,600
with how we explain eve is by leveraging

01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,000
even architecture

01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,920
a common consistent environment where

01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,880
you can deploy apps the same ease and

01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,520
the same

01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,639
flexibility agility as in the cloud now

01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,239
having said that

01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,320
what people don't always realize is like

01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,840
in iot and tom talked about this there's

01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,199
already hundreds of millions of dollars

01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,520
often invested

01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:17,440
in specific verticals on scada and local

01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,040
software that runs on-prem it's

01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,040
analyzing and processing data today so

01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,880
the ability to fuse that

01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,400
new software and old software together

01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,880
is one of the reasons we built eve is

01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,639
with a

01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,960
with virtualization as a starting point

01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,719
containerization built on top security

01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,480
so it's actually not just gateways we

01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,880
see customers deploy greenfield gateways

01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,639
but we also see customers trying to mix

01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,400
old workloads and new workloads at the

01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,280
edge and the ability to support all that

01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,960
diversity

01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,360
is why we needed to come with a new

01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,520
quote unquote operating system

01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:47,360
um let's see i think we have one more

01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:50,639
question we can take

01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:53,199
and this one is for you steve is

01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:56,800
any idea on new more tools to improve

01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:56,800
the agility that you just mentioned

01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,639
um i don't know if it's more i don't

01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,960
know if it's more

01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:07,199
i mean i i would say yes there's you

01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,080
know it's probably us and everybody else

01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,800
that's that's

01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,360
that's delivering software in the cloud

01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,880
it is

01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:17,920
all about agility velocity

01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,880
visibility control doing all that it's

01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,600
all about

01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,080
that kind of a thing so you know i know

01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,560
we

01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,480
every release we have more and more

01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,800
tools that will help people

01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,400
make it simpler make it more automated

01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,880
make it easier to

01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,560
to get the visibility in the control and

01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,639
to such that ultimately what you

01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,639
you what you really want is ultimately

01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:41,120
an autonomous infrastructure

01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,239
that optimize self optimizes its stuff

01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:45,040
itself

01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:46,719
for the performance security and and

01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,679
cost of your applications which is what

01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,360
you care about

01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,800
and and you want that for the entire

01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,800
infrastructure in the core

01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,920
as well as out at the distributed edge

01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,600
and you just and that's

01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,120
that's where i think the world is going

01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,960
and that's where all this

01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,960
software and software-defined things are

01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,639
going to get to where it's apis that

01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,600
will be controlled and shared among

01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,800
all the different layers such that now i

01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,239
don't it's going to take a while to get

01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,400
there but ultimately that's what you're

01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:12,639
looking for with the application

01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,239
the infrastructure optimizes itself for

01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:15,440
the performance security and cost of the

01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:17,679
application

01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,600
so yeah we're making it the same thing

01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,480
visibility control and security always

01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,560
yes

01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,400
we make it so simple and i think with

01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,120
software defined and cloud we can

01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,560
actually

01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,480
do that we never could have done that on

01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,080
prop and again this might take us 10 or

01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,040
20 years but that's where the industry's

01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,880
going

01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,920
okay great well we're at time here so

01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,960

01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:52,159
couple of comments while you're on

who you know i i go a long way over the

01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,320
last 10 years he has keynoted several on

01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,760
the esses

01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,320
in the past and your vision right you

01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,239
know we

01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,920
really thank the like the industry

01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,639
thanks your thought leadership i mean we

01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,520
need

01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:10,000
people like you to drive us and kind of

01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,400
uh

01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,360
go to where we should be going and i

01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,760
love your your

01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,520
your you know summarizing you know what

01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,360
what i just heard right which is

01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,600
you know open source is important as you

01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,239
get to scale you need the simplicity of

01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,639
cloud

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:25,760
with the operational control of on-prem

01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:28,800
edge is different

01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,600
right but consistency and you know

01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,719
openness

01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,040
is key and then tools and technologies

01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,840
like

01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:37,120
5g or you know a whole set of agility

01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,760
tools are critical

01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:41,280
right because you know it has to not

01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,880
just follow but lead

01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,199
and you know no longer about you know

01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:48,000
ghost id and things like that so i think

01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:49,520
i think the the the discussions and the

01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,600
points you covered uh say

01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:52,960

01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,480
