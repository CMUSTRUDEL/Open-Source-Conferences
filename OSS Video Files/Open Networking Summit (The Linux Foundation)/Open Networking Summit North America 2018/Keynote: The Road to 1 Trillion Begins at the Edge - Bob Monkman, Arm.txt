	Keynote: The Road to 1 Trillion Begins at the Edge - Bob Monkman, Director, Software Strategy and Ecosystem Programs, Network Infrastructure, Arm

Today’s cloud is not built to support the demands of tomorrow’s network infrastructure, where the edge of the network is lined with up to 1 trillion intelligent devices by 2035, many requiring very low latency and efficient acceleration. A massive transformation in network infrastructure is underway and the Arm ecosystem will play a prominent role in the realization of this vision, bringing unique and compelling solutions based on lower TCO, efficiencies in compute density, performance/watt, greater scalability, and security in the face of challenging industry goals for virtualization and 5G metrics. Join us for a comprehensive and insightful view into the approach taken by the Arm ecosystem to deliver efficient, heterogeneous, scale-out architecture for next-generation infrastructure support AI/AR/ML use cases and more. Attendees will walk away with an appreciation for the fundamental Arm value proposition, our contribution and initiatives within the Linux Foundation Open Networking community, proof points and progress to date in enabling this vision.
