	Keynote: Open Networking 2.0 – Raising the Game for the Networking Industry - Gavin Cato, Senior Vice President, Network Development Engineering, Dell EMC

If you haven’t heard Networking is back in the game and cool again invigorated by open standards, open source and open communities of innovation. It started by disaggregating networking hardware and software. We call that Open Networking 1.0. But the Networking industry is not standing still and neither is Dell EMC. Come hear Gavin Cato, Sr. Vice President Engineering Dell EMC Networking, share Dell EMC’s plans to raise the Open Networking bar once again for the industry with Open Networking 2.0. Come listen and get in the game with us.

hello I'm a storyteller so I'm going to

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,820
spend a little bit of time talking

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,860
through the stories and the reasons why

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,320
Dell has done what it's done internally

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,599
what we're seeing is an industry in to

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,190
end and and then we'll just go through

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,550
that and work through it to what we

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,050
should be seeing going forward if you

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,150
look at where we've been and it's it was

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,820
interesting because believe it or not

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,369
uber and Dell did not work on the slides

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,140
together but what you find is we really

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,030
have gone from closed systems if you

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,100
look at the mainframe systems the server

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,260
client architectures that we've been

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,660
through we've really been moving to

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,730
those open ecosystems and it started all

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,890
the way down from the a6 and where you

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,750
saw the customized proprietary Asics and

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,640
you still see some today for niche

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,129
applications or specifically for cost

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,539
reasons but you're seeing the merchant

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,680
silicones really emerge and you're

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,660
seeing the pace of those those silicon

00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,309
advances increase it used to be about

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,719
every three years you can count on that

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,070
and now you're seeing that about every

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,379
year you're seeing something come out

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,689
and then you're seeing the interleaving

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,119
of different competitive vendors in that

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,310
space so that the timing and the pace of

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,049
development in networking and open

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,640
networking has certainly changed which

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,470
presents a challenge if you're building

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,270
hardware systems because you've got to

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,430
find a way to keep up with that

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,259
investment that it's occurring and then

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,659
you had you had open standards around

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,430
hardware you saw some of the stuff that

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,110
was released through OCP where there are

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,720
standards in terms of how you build

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,340
Hardware some of that is certainly taken

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,630
to account where you get standards of

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,610
how you're going to build a hardware

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,350
platform top to bottom and how you're

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,600
going to move in a position to

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,240
accelerate that transition as you see

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,829
the chipsets of all and then you get

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,479
into the networking space one of the

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,950
challenges in the networking space that

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,600
we've always had is if you looked at

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,950
innovation you looked at the innovation

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,110
the chipset vendors were bringing

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,000
whether it was from one company or it

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,560
was across multiple companies the

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,329
challenge was in embedding that

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,060
innovation quickly and bringing that to

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,950
market to do that a lot of times

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,540
somebody would ka there's a new chipset

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,640
or we want to cost down on this platform

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,590
and you had to hop between chipset

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,270
families and what did would happen is

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,780
you would go back and say it's about 30

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,490
engineers about six months to do

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,310
if you really had innovation it may be

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,080
longer maybe a year but by that time you

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,720
did that it was often too late in the

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,040
market and and so you were always having

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,940
to judge and figure out how to move

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,740
forward

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,090
you no longer really have the luxury of

00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,600
doing that you have to have these

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,800
interfaces that are open standardized

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,140
but the key is you're trying to do an

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,900
open standardized interface but you

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,790
can't eliminate the differentiation you

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,320
must enable the chipsets to

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,840
differentiate through the networking

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,540
hardware and open up new ideas and new

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,520
concepts so you have to manage that

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,620
standard in such a way so that you have

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,150
extensibility of that standard but you

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,890
may have to have a path that allows

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,410
differentiation for the chipsets and

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,930
then allows from that from that

00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:00,470
differentiation it to evolve into a

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,180
standard within the industry and so if

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,280
you looked at for example Sai and what

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,959
was done with Sai through OCP that was a

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,850
great initial effort and that was put

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,900
together I think Facebook Microsoft Dell

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,360
we're all involved in that effort

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,400
associated with Sai you've seen that

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,780
continue to evolve and broker some of

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,820
the relationships between ships at

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,280
vendors and it will have to continue to

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,140
move forward but the idea is that you

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,489
want to open up those systems you want

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,640
to open them up with regard to the

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:27,920
hardware Dell took a very a very good

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,019
initial step and we broke out about

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,730
three years ago we broke and we

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,350
separated the ability to deal with the

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,959
hardware in the software so networking

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,670
systems were typically closed what we

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,830
allowed is we allowed other operating

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,570
systems to come on that hardware and I

00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,280
think you started seeing announcement

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,810
that have followed suit I think there

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,670
was an announcement by Cisco as well

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,989
that has come out and is starting to

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,730
look at options with regard to

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,620
separation of hardware and software and

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,989
I think you're going to continue to see

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,640
that move forward so you now have the

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,769
open systems on the hardware side you

00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,510
have the ability to move your innovation

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,790
forward quickly by standardizing that

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,830
interface and then you have the open the

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,269
open software the next thing that

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,310
happens as you start to look at the

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,530
controller side there are some systems

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,030
where you have you have specific needs

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,410
where you want to introduce a controller

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,420
those controllers didn't have to be

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,220
integrated into those open systems and

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,560
you're seeing some of the announcements

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,539
come out about various controllers but

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,430
you will see those integrated some in a

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:23,900
standard way some in a non-standard way

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,680
but you would hope that that would

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,120
certainly have

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,860
all but you will have the option for

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,479
those standard controllers and then it

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,940
becomes about the orchestration and the

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,860
tools that sit on top the reality is you

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,750
don't want your networking system to be

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,500
dictating your tools in an end in

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,810
solution if you have unique Linux

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,030
versions customized versions of Linux if

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,100
you have customized versions of tool

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,530
sets that lock you into managing it that

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,840
way you lose the ability to manage your

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,699
systems into end so that your server

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,500
storage and networking systems can be

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,050
translated an Indian solution that

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,699
allows you as a company bringing to your

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,310
customers differentiation in your

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,050
services and product offerings it

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,820
presents an additional expense for you

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,770
and so you're not focused on the things

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,360
that can bring you the highest value so

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,250
part of the objective and all of this

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,410
was an open networking industry is to

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,669
simplify this top-to-bottom and you're

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,199
seeing that in terms of some of the

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,699
simplification of protocols and the

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,060
simplification of platforms as they're

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,560
coming to market what you have to pay

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,220
attention to and this whole thing is

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,590
wire people open sourcing um there are

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,630
reasons that people open source some of

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,130
that is speed time to market they're

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,979
looking at the community to help drive

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,470
that speed some of the agility there are

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,780
reasons to open source to to try and

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,270
establish your product is the standard

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,070
you you're offering as a standard to

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,320
control our slowdown pieces in the

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,849
industry there are reasons outsourced

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,490
because the integration effort is

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,260
complex if you look at all the VNS by

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,760
integrating all those of ens and getting

00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,280
that testing done as hard if you're

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,250
trying to keep that close to your vest

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,110
it's a complex process so the ability to

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,970
open it up to the community open up

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,530
those testing standards open up the

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,620
ability for the community it as a whole

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,270
to build in the natural integration

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,710
point so that those VNL apps can come

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,419
through and you can get the changing

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,970
service chaining functioning correctly

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:16,789
it gives you an opportunity um security

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:19,490
is going to be a big one if you have if

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:21,349
you have a modified Linux version that

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,789
is being built by your vendor then in

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:24,320
likelihood when there's skirty issue

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,360
you're going back to that vendor you're

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,550
asking them to give a you a build that

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,370
secures your infrastructure and fixes

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,320
that guy if you're going off a pure

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,510
kernel then the expectation is you can

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,530
take that kernel you can take a release

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,420
of a

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,390
in the industry you can apply that and

00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,070
you can move on unmodified kernels they

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,480
allow you to build the containers just

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,280
the same way you would for your server

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,170
systems and you can treat your tools on

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,610
the servers the same way so you have to

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,830
look at security and how that's going to

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,320
work it comes down to the DNA sometimes

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,570
of companies is it in their DNA to do

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,970
work in an open environment the

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,760
economics and just frankly how open are

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,350
you really isn't an open set of API so

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,900
that you can then program to is it an

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,820
openness and here take the code happy to

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,700
work with you and then is there a

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,380
support model behind that it doesn't do

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,060
a companies a lot of good if you open

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,440
source all the code but then you as a

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,020
company when you're looking at those

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,340
open source opportunities to pull that

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,350
into your company do you have the

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,540
ability to support it to integrate it to

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,610
build on top of it or you were bound by

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,810
those resource limitations and then

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,200
you're going to be having to fill the

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:33,230
gaps on the back side of this so the

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,790
journey forward and some of this is

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,830
Dells perspective but I want to try and

00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,740
stick to and talk a lot about open

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,330
switch as well we certainly see the

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,370
merchants silicon continuing to merge

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,950
the idea is to continue to bring that

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,930
forward this is some of the silicon

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,520
that's been invested in I assure you

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,070
there are more silicon vendors that are

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,180
out there I know there's Barefoot's out

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,500
there no beams out there caveum and some

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,430
of the stuff that they've now done with

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,840
Mellanox is another option and and so I

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,950
think you're going to continue our

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,570
marvel you're going to continue to see

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:12,200
the opportunities there with innovation

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,150
in the silicon for Dell we built on top

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,190
of that with the s-series and in CRS

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,350
series as e-series specifically focused

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,690
at the data center market into n

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,640
solutions and then we've given the

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,830
option on those hardware platforms as we

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,630
go up to be able to offer alternative

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,710
software versions so you can go get

00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,870
something from Big Switch

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,979
as one of our partners cumulus is a

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,390
partner of ours IP infusion pluribus but

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,969
then at the same time what we wanted to

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,490
do and Del's process and thought process

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,940
was to build our own as a West from

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,520
scratch do it the right way and then we

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,980
stepped into open switch what ended up

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,300
happening with regard to open switch is

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,790
there was an opportunity to

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,580
the industry for we had a conversation

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,860
with Michael Dell and he agreed to let

00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,500
us open source the base of the operating

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,790
system we the reason we didn't open the

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,310
initially the layer two layer three

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,050
stacks is one is we felt like there were

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,779
companies better positioned to provide

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,329
that innovation in layer two layer three

00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:13,820
we felt that by treating layer two layer

00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,290
three is an application and going out

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,060
with the open source and the platform

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,550
side you could open up to a broader

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,950
industry allow the innovation from other

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,410
players in the hardware industry to also

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,450
drive those operating systems forward

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,209
and what we wanted to do is get that

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,430
done the open switch effort that you've

00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:33,560
seen by Dell and other companies that

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,490
have been involved in that space has

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,959
been focused on building the full stack

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,720
Dell has been primarily dealing with the

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,220
lower half of that so then sitting on

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,529
top of that we have the integration with

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:51,110
nsx opendaylight and then a series of

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:52,310
automation tool sets coming on top these

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,940
are intended for mission-critical

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:59,320
deployments I will tell you that opx is

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,810
a base is running in a Tier one carrier

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,640
it's running with fog on top and then

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,890
some modifications that they have done

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,890
and then support it on the back end by

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,190
Dell so there is hardened code out there

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,690
right now that's available that you can

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,000
go pick up on the open source community

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,440
you can pick it up you can drop it on a

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,770
hardware platform deal with their

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,100
hardware drivers and then move forward

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:26,720
just grabbing something like fog or FR

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:31,430
and then integrate the tool sets on top

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,920
ok expandable so expandability and the

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,529
ability not to lock it in to make sure

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,940
that the use cases can be abstracted if

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:40,130
you look at some of the open source

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,540
that's out there right now one of the

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,310
things you're finding is you're finding

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,140
that that open source can really be

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,089
intended for specific use cases the

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,579
ideas continue to drive that forward and

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:53,390
brought our environments and then

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:54,829
composable stacks on top ahead I'm just

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,620
gonna flipped through two last quick

00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:59,870
charts but the idea is to abstract away

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,670
the services on top enabled in

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,470
innovation but keep it consistent

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,630
between what's an open source

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,520
in what Dell has so now with that

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,910
hardened proposition of the hardened

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,980
lower layers what we announced today is

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,140
we announced you now have the

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,840
opportunity to go out and get a

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,460
commercially hardened deployed and have

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,750
this event the company's been around for

00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:26,030
about 35 years in Metis which and you

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,070
have the opportunity to take layer 2

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:31,700
layer 3 software that's been hardened by

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:34,640
the market and put that in on top of

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,740
that open source base and it will be

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,020
supported by that we offer the ability

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,520
to support that end-to-end so it's the

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,200
first case of a composable

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,630
infrastructure meaning that you can go

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,150
out there and you can look at specific

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,430
sets of services and you can pick and

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,430
choose the service that you want on that

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,620
stack and you can get that service and

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,930
ignore the rest of the protocols so that

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,460
you're not having them take up space in

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,710
your systems you're not having to deal

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,330
with any security risks associated with

00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,980
it you're not having to deal with the

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,020
overhead of maintaining and configuring

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,220
the other protocols you can focus it

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,290
down to what you need but it's the first

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,240
opportunity to really have a hardened

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,590
stack composable on an infrastructure

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,990
that can be supported by a company and

00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,090
then finally on top of that then you

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,640
have the automation framework the goal

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,530
is to keep that as open as possible

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,690
these integrations are occurring they're

00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,520
not driven by Dell a number of these

00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,290
have just simply occurred in the open

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,020
market building on top of those open

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,140
interfaces and the goal is to enable

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,310
that you can have the Python programming

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,070
you got the C chromium the rest

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,720
interfaces but the idea is to open up

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,090
the innovation and allow that innovation

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,880
come in to the broader market so that's

00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,370
what Dell is doing and and where we see

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,780
the market going huge opportunities

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,710
going forward and we look forward to

00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,960
working with the broader community

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,960
continue to move it forward thank you

00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,760
