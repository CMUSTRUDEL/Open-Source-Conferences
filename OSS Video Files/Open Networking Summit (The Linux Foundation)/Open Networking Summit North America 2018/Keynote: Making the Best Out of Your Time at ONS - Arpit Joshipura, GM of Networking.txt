and so what we're going to do now is go

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:11,030
through and talk about how you can

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,690
maximize your time add-ons and

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:18,510
effectively here's what I want to sort

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,730
of show you so this is this is the

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,820
submissions we got for the tracks that

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,160
you are about to go into we got five

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,580
times the number of submissions that we

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,480
can afford from a timing perspective on

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,790
just 70 tracks right we got like so many

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,340
demos right and we've tried to

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,260
accommodate as many as we can because I

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,739
know you need to take time on each of

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,870
these we put reception's training all

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,989
the morning activities etc so you know

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,219
the the whole event and and I would like

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,559
to give a big round of applause to

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,940
Angela and her team for pulling this off

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,850
I mean this is this awesome if you look

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,120
at the topics and the technology right I

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,460
mean you can't read it but it's very

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,670
very vast and this is why harmonization

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,840
2.0 is so critical where it in facts the

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,930
adjacent markets so what I have done is

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,170
you know this is on the website but this

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,390
is a simple diagram on technologies that

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,000
are now starting to converge across

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,159
three major markets the service provider

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,590
markets which you heard extensively from

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,930
today tomorrow and day after you will

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,560
hear from cloud as well as enterprise

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,159
networking folks right we have very very

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,689
interesting keynotes and and specifics

00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,820
but if you look at the way the tracks

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,040
are organized there are a couple of

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,079
general interest tracks which one of

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,420
them is focusing on futures the other

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,530
one is focusing on the business

00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,540
architecture so if you're like the PLM

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,920
type that's kind of would be suitable

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,600
for you and then you have two tracks for

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,270
sort of the service providers and the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,610
cloud combined where one of them is a

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,740
heavy DevOps technical track the other

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,210
one is more business architecture track

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,670
and the same thing is true on the

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,640
enterprise IT side so there's a DevOps

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,560
ID and then there's the CIOs IT

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,879
Architect rack so that's kind of how the

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,120
tracks are located and they are all on

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,770
this floor and the seventh floor right

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,590
and I think by now you should know how

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:31,260
to get to each of these things and so

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,450
this content for ons has would not have

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,849
been possible if it was not for our

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,959
program committee so I want to bring the

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:44,340
program committee up on the stage if you

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,989
know why don't we all come in please the

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,569
program committee if you see your name

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:54,090
come on in again you know it's it's

00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:57,120
circled when dealing lis Allah Cathy

00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:02,370
Catherine snehal who is not here today

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:05,940
oh joy Marcus and John so come on in and

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,670
by the way these are the experts in the

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,790
industry I mean they they have created

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,040
an amazing content for you so on behalf

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,319
of the program committee maybe Ling Li

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,629
if you can say a few words so she's from

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,510
China Mobile and I think you can read

00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,430
where they are from so maybe go ahead hi

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,790
everyone I'm Ling Li from China Mobile

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,549
and first of all I'd like to say it is

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,849
my honor to serve with with my own

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,180
fellow committee members to be serving

00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:39,060
food for this important event and

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,860
actually as you can imagine it pained

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,280
ours that thing to make the tough

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,530
decisions given that we have so many

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,019
distinguished submissions for more areas

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,700
of open source networking in all these

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:55,409
areas of innovation in open source and

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,319
speaking for myself I think I'm coming

00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,840
from the largest mobile service

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,700
providing the word China Mobile and we

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,340
certainly believe that we can provide

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,670
some of the unique use cases in kravitz

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,920
and contributing our own development

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:14,750
resources and in building this open

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,790
source networking ecosystem and also

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,259
throughout to me that I see more and

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,430
more Chinese companies are actually

00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:25,470
joining the force and it might also be

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,970
my slight hope that perhaps

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,580
you know things we have more

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,220
contributions and resource coming from

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,190
Asia perhaps you know in in the next

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,920
program committee we could also see more

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,470
Asian faces because you guys are

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,320
actually giving us the heart task so you

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,430
have to share the burden and let's work

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,230
together to build success and we see

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,840
some of the our open source net

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:56,100
networking projects to be real deployed

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,550
and be successful thank you join the

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:04,860
counter so if if you don't like the

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:08,070
sessions if you like it no just kidding
