	Keynote: The Challenge and Opportunity to Build a Transparent Network - Yiqun Cai, Vice President, Alibaba Group

 Todayâ€™s applications running in massive scale data centers demand the underlying networks to be not only fast and resilient but also transparent.  The challenges we face test the principles we have followed to build the networks in the past. Scale, programmability, and interoperability are the ever-present and yet increasingly harder problems to deal with. But this is also an opportunity to create a new generation of networking infrastructure towards a better tomorrow.
