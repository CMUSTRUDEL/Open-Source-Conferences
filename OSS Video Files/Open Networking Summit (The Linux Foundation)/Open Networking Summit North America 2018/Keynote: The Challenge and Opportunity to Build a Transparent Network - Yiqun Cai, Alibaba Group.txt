Description: 
	Keynote: The Challenge and Opportunity to Build a Transparent Network - Yiqun Cai, Vice President, Alibaba Group

 Todayâ€™s applications running in massive scale data centers demand the underlying networks to be not only fast and resilient but also transparent.  The challenges we face test the principles we have followed to build the networks in the past. Scale, programmability, and interoperability are the ever-present and yet increasingly harder problems to deal with. But this is also an opportunity to create a new generation of networking infrastructure towards a better tomorrow.

thank you and really honored to be here

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,570
again and it was great to CD the video

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,799
and I was surprised to see that Nick

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,590
does look a lot like Daniel Craig Nick

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,060
okay and more importantly I think there

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,609
are a lot of things that

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,519
Vinc mentioned it really resonated with

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,800
us and with me and so today what I'm

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,849
going to talk about is what we had

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,070
alibaba faces our challenges and our

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,610
opportunities to build a network that

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,820
can satisfy today's applications as you

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:43,050
all know we and Alibaba is experiencing

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:47,100
a great great expansion in digital

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:50,190
innovation and we're seeing we're seeing

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,460
this on a worldwide scale and then to

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,149
support our variable businesses here are

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,280
the little fancy blocks that you see

00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:02,250
these are just some of the things that

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,420
we do in our ababa and what they what

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,330
they do have in common

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,820
in order to support the great expansion

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,390
of digital innovation is that it it

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,490
demand a reliable infrastructure they

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,130
demand a reliable networking

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,640
infrastructure so that the applications

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:23,700
can run in a case support a business now

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,939
a network reliability is not something

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,229
new we all know that at the beginning of

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,619
the internet or when the internet

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,960
started to grow 30 years ago reliability

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,009
was one of the genes that's built any

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,380
internet the Internet has so many

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:44,070
unreliable systems components like hosts

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,740
links or even networks the magic of data

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,159
and protocol transmissions had all those

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,310
things and make the internet work and

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,490
more importantly during those old days

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,320
it is the human being it's a human

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,229
beings who are interacting with each

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,930
other through the network and with us

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,329
interacting over the network the network

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,560
take the retransmissions takes about

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:13,739
tens or even longer to complete does not

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,230
hampers our ability to interact with the

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:20,370
does not hamper our ability to use the

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,290
network but that day these days are long

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,409
gone

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,540
today in hyper skill data centers we run

00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,269
we connect hundreds of thousands of

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,510
nodes and we business critical

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:41,099
applications that are very very in a way

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:45,090
demand even the most critical I should

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:50,599
say the most they can't even survive

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:54,150
let's say the errors that we believe

00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,470
that we take for granted many many years

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,159
ago let me put it this way

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:02,340
think of a network today with hundreds

00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,709
of thousands links and many of them do

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,170
work well except that one of them is

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:12,450
dropping let's say one packet out of

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:16,799
10,000 the challenge today is how to

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,319
find our link and isolated in time so

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,180
that before our applications freak out

00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,310
and applications can be a game

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,099
application and can be other business

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,019
critical applications and this level of

00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,410
demand this level of demand of

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:34,530
reliability did not exist in a past for

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,470
many reasons one of the reason is that

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,609
during the 30 during the old days of the

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,190
internet we relied on a protocol and

00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:47,310
data retransmission to recover from

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,530
individual errors but in the meantime we

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,010
didn't as users we didn't really care

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,260
how to network what but today as Vint

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,139
also mentioned earlier though things

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,470
have changed today's applications

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,120
today's users they not only demand a

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,750
network to be reliable they also

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,810
understand how the network works they

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,169
also see the benefits of a transparent

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,979
network how that how that can help their

00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:20,130
develop applications as a result not

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:23,039
only do they want a reliable network

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,550
they also demand a transparency from the

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,780
level up so that through the openness so

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,720
that they can build

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,980
into their applications build into their

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,540
user experiences to work better so with

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,310
that challenge it is not that we don't

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,380
have anything today we do have lots of

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,840
tools today traditionally we have

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,290
protocols like BGP we have protocols

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,710
like PFD that can help us to detect a

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,870
link or a node failure anywhere from 50

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,730
milliseconds to let's say tens of

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,050
seconds

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,860
however those protocols were developed

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,110
during the days when we can add two

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,140
monarchs to the reliability to the

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,070
network and we're happy about this but

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,080
today's in today's environment those

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,840
recoveries is not adequate they're just

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,330
not sufficient because those tools in

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,390
general those tools developed 30 years

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,360
ago in general they are only capable of

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,390
telling us binary errors whether our

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,790
link is up where the neighbor is up

00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,520
they're not capable of telling us what

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,170
is actually going on in the network so

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,380
that we can improve our applications

00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:37,230
then improve our user experiences and

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,470
this gives us an opportunity and a

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,840
challenge to go forward to develop new

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:48,390
set of tools to develop new set of

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:51,600
standards and luckily this is actually

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,820
going on we at Alibaba a very fortunate

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,280
and honored to be part of the community

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,110
to work with many many others to develop

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,810
develop those tools and develop those

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,200
standards in true star ways we worked

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,320
with chip vendors to put more and more

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,950
instrumentations

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,950
into our network into those chips and we

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:13,010
work with we work with our partners to

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:16,710
develop more and more tools and

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:19,710
standards so that that allows us to seat

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,830
and network better so that we can allow

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,400
applications to react to the glitches in

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,200
the network better it's a very very

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,500
difficult job to be honest with you

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,350
because to do that requires a real

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,840
integration of networking technology or

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,970
the traditional networking technology to

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,370
be integrated with the latest of the

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,460
computer

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,650
science but fortunately we're actually

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,169
seeing the integration of let's say

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,750
networking with big data with machine

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,910
learning and many others were seen this

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,430
new neck taller new technologies being

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,570
applied in their working to solve our

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,880
problems it's just a start but as what

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,979
was happening over the years with the

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,710
growth of the Internet it takes the

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:09,729
great effort of everybody takes great

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:12,280
effort of every company and everyone who

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:15,310
who's part of the ecosystem to make the

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,650
whole thing better so in we and Alibaba

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,710
very very honored to be a member of this

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,620
community so we don't have a whole lot

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,830
of time I want to conclude my talk with

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:30,070
a an analogy that has been used many

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:32,440
many times before over the time over the

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:36,699
years people tend to describe a computer

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:39,460
network as freeways or roads so what we

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:42,520
want from a transparent network point of

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,940
view is that we drive on those road

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,490
in addition or maybe instead of always

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,639
using a headline to find your directions

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,120
maybe you want the network to tell you

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:58,330
where it's congested where it is blocked

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,520
and where needs a better way to your

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:08,459
destination okay thank you

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,459
