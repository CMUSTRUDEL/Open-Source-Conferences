	00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:12,690
over the years we have connected

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,990
billions of people we have laid the

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,830
foundation for innovation and growth and

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,820
we have brought it everywhere but this

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:27,660
time it's different

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:30,000
now our IOT 5g and automation technology

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,809
stands ready to unlock a wave of new

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,200
value we're talking operating rooms

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,190
connected across oceans trucks

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,230
communicating to increase efficiency and

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:47,200
factory floor is going fully digital

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,200
we'll see waste reduce accidents

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,410
dramatically decrees and remarkable new

00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,430
business models come to life but we're

00:00:53,410 --> 00:01:01,360
getting ahead of ourselves to make this

00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:05,850
a reality we're on a quest to make

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,680
technology easy to use adopt and scale

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,380
to build an ecosystem together with our

00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,430
customers where change is easy where

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:18,160
standards are global and where the full

00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:23,500
value of connectivity can be realized

00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,980
faster than ever getting too easy won't

00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,920
be easy

00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,800
but we're determined to leave the way to

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,890
move fast

00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,880
to knock down barriers and to cut

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,880
through complexity

00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:47,479
join us okay it's my pleasure to

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,780
introduce mark Olson from Erickson he's

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,939
the head of our D portfolio and digital

00:01:50,780 --> 00:02:04,250
services at Erickson

00:01:52,939 --> 00:02:07,130
so what's please welcome so I'm very

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,229
happy to be here I think it's a good

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,880
good session with the open network and

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,910
stomach I know what the Phoenix

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,480
foundation of thumb and quest were you

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,980
see I think one of the reasons why we

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,049
started with requests to is because I

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,599
think that is very much the reason why I

00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,239
go to work I think we're why you go to

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,819
work I think we all making trying to

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,500
make things simple I mean we tried to

00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,269
make a software sack simply to kind of

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,989
use we try to make a products and

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:38,329
services simply to use quickly to deploy

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:42,530
everything should be quickly easier and

00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:45,590
simpler I will be joined a bit later

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,540
with a with a Bryson but I was stopped

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,730
with actually talking about five year

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,250
not as a radio standard I think there

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,930
was a lot of radio in in the video but

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,959
very much as five years subtract from

00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:01,970
for innovation yeah where is the clicker

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:05,750
yeah and also talk about the role of

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:09,230
open source when we're actually building

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,060
the 5e networks I mean telecom has been

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,750
used to do proprietor boxes that is not

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,269
how it works

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,380
going forward man so really about also

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,940
the role of open source on the

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:25,670
communities that the driving force for

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:27,799
building the the future networks so what

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,410
is the difference between 5d and what we

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,000
are done before I mean all the telecom

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,790
networks that we are done historic like

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,980
2d 3d they have more or less being

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,220
focused and only providing two basic

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,260
services boy some data what they stand

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,650
the difference which mean 5v5 is

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,299
completely use case driven that means

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,500
that we don't really know what service

00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:50,210
is the 5d network

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,920
to provide of course there will still be

00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,010
a need to provide the basic data service

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,200
etc but a lot of the new services coming

00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:01,220
in they are not kind of dare develop

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,310
outside the network of course five is

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,700
also a technology lead we are developing

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,400
new radios we are developing a new core

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,590
but what we also now doing is that are

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,600
we going to use two networks how are we

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,010
going to monetize network how do we

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,750
actually making sure that we have

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,390
networks that are fit for the purpose

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:25,400
for the use case or the services that we

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:27,740
are using so the network needs to have

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,430
the capability to supply multiple use

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,410
cases and each use cases may have

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,419
completely different characteristics

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,370
need in terms of latency in terms of

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:39,860
bandwidth in terms of cost points you

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,300
need to hit for that specific service we

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,480
also need to be able to move the

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,830
monetization path this is to consume

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,060
it's of course very much what we are

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,840
doing today but business the business

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:55,010
business to business to consumers and of

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:58,940
course we need to be able to create and

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:01,490
deploy services in hours and minutes and

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,940
not maybe month or weeks or years even

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,780
and of course only supported by a Serie

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,900
touch operational model we usually

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,640
divide the file use cases in what we

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,470
call massive machine type communication

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,380
critical machine type communication and

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,240
enhance mobile Borba so if you look at

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,550
massive machine type communication that

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,590
is a lot of that we can already do today

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,360
with the current radio standards but

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,020
that is typically our smart meters

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,750
logistic asset tracking fleet management

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:36,260
very much driven by low cost low end

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:39,620
mini small data volumes massive numbers

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,150
I mean to look on some of these like

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,970
small data meaning if you principals

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,130
have a body alarm most cases it doesn't

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,919
send any data at all but when it needs

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,120
to send the data it better work then on

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,460
the other side we have the critical

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,710
machine type communication here is more

00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,880
like industrial use cases industrial

00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,620
robots remote control haptic control

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,409
mean this could be like requiring

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,669
extremely high reliable

00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:10,699
extremely low latency and of course an

00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,930
extremely high availability on the

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,370
bottom we have the more or less the

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,590
existing business that we are today but

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,009
of course within horns mobile Borbon

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,080
when bandwidth is increasing when

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,470
latency is going down of course we can

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,669
support much more like 4k 8k video

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,830
augmented reality etcetera when we're

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:32,750
having applications that or much more

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,669
kind of latencies critical than the

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,090
current application of course when the

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,280
latency is growing down from like maybe

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,409
30 millisecond on the own axis down to

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,009
like 2 milliseconds on the axis then of

00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:47,240
course a lot of new cases opens up but

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,849
of course we're talking very much about

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,440
five years but of course the raelia far

00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:54,889
gate that is rolling out more or less

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,330
like next year or 2019 2020 but a lot of

00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:57,919
the things that they are discussing

00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,659
today for instance on the on the masa

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,069
machine type communication that is

00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,740
already happening today and we are

00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:05,539
rebuilding the core network already

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,039
today to cater for these type of new

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:09,979
services and of course that

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,259
opportunities are endless open source I

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,940
will come back to that one on the on the

00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,469
next slide but when you're looking on

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,050
the development of the infrastructure

00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:20,210
you will kind of see how much different

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,669
open-source products that are needed to

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,949
can build up this infrastructure and

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,110
also in the use case level we talked

00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,690
about a a machine learning and apps

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,219
using Fabian wireless cognitive a lot of

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,009
that ecosystems that's also of course

00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:35,270
built around open source and of course

00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,490
for us is really about enabling

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,229
industries and the people to take the

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:43,490
next step in detail

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:46,610
digitalization journey so forgive it

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,650
starts today or at a solar is 35 you

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,379
requires a Software Defined Networking

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,810
it require complete programmability of

00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:56,029
the networking and of course it starts

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,099
already with like anything on Sdn

00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:01,000
because we need to be able to have a

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:03,500
flexibility in deployment of our

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,330
application we need our flexibility in

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,000
actually adapting the network to the

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,919
needs of the applications and of course

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,279
going forward going into cloud native

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,330
and edge cloud but we also of course

00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,830
doing a lot of things also an

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,470
application side freeze

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,480
splitting up the control pain and use

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:24,020
the plane to be able to move up the use

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,780
of learn further out in the network to

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,790
do it compute but also have more like

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,890
mobilised applications like and of

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,140
course going into the micro service or

00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,490
in container based application

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,040
management and orchestration same thing

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,660
we need to break the silos that we have

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,590
had in the OCS system have a horizontal

00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:44,120
iced model driven management and

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,740
orchestration very much about what we

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,240
are doing in tune up and of course

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,160
adding the machine learning and

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,430
artificial intelligence to reach to

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,860
automation and Siri touch it needs to be

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,560
able to distribute workloads we need to

00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,140
be able to put applications further and

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,490
further out at the edge but maybe also

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,580
in some cases all the way out to the

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,920
base stations we also need to be able to

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,810
have network separations resilience and

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,840
isolation to be able to handle different

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,720
type of needs from the applications and

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,040
the use cases network slices very much

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,680
we are discussing network size this is

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,570
more or less the capability to create a

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,730
logical isolated network within the

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,190
network that you can for instance have

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,020
for specific services you can have that

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,880
an enterprise actually owns a specific

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,880
slice within and operate the network or

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,460
it can be done just to making sure that

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,170
certain of your services or having the

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,610
most optimal network infrastructure for

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:42,110
that specific service of course having a

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:46,760
total cost of ownership for application

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:49,400
lifecycle management reduce time to

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,460
market for the service creation and the

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,260
service deployment and of course when

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,770
you're looking all this you probably see

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,810
that like a lot of these areas that

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,500
bring up as the pastafari

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:05,410
is depending on the role of the open

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,060
source and the communities that we are

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,030
we are talking about here today at this

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,190
conference and of course for us is

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,770
really very much about like contributing

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:21,250
using and driving the development of a

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,250
number of these open-source communities

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:33,770
so another thing is that open source and

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:36,710
standards and standards I mean very much

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:43,250
the classical you call them sometimes

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:46,010
paper standards but with in telecom

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,260
there is a need still for I will call

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,170
like paper standards like 3d PP and Etsy

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,930
and the reason is that that if you're

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:57,560
going to build a fire the ecosystem with

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,540
like billions of devices it's pretty

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,310
important at the interface between the

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,710
device and the network is pretty stable

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:09,080
because there is a huge ecosystem and

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:12,860
investment but on the other hand there

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,080
is also need for increasing speed in

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,420
innovation and that is very open source

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,180
comes in so I think in five year I think

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,250
this is really the first time now when

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:27,170
we're actually combining these two

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:29,510
forces into two one so if you look an

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,310
open source open source what does it

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:35,840
bring to the table

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:38,030
speed it brings code it brings a way

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,180
that we actually work together in this

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,750
room it brings innovation and it's bring

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,760
merit-based whatever is it's kind of

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:51,230
what the best thing will kind of wind so

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:53,450
say it's a bit over Darwin's law but

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,460
there is also some drawbacks sometimes

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,050
some open source I mean how do we make

00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,970
sure that we get better interoperability

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,620
between the different open source

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,950
products from a lifecycle management

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,800
perspective there is sometimes

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,270
competition there is a lot of open

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,090
source product that is trying to solve

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,050
this the same thing and I think this is

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,850
of course what the Linux Foundation

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,310
network is trying as well to kind of

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,640
making sure that we can be better and

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,020
quicker on that forum so standardization

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,300
on the haedong giving a lot of global

00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,010
scale I mean the reasons why your phone

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,750
works across all over the world is very

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:32,240
much about or 3d PPS done it focused on

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,810
interfaces and functionality and that of

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,820
course gives better interoperability and

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,320
of course it provides a bit of our

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,590
long-term outlook and backwards

00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,320
compatibility so if we can do this in a

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,060
very smart way I think historically this

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,070
has been a part I think now we need to

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,960
bring them together and sometimes I've

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,840
even been contending for the same spot

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,600
but if we do this good I think 1+1 can

00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,990
be bigger than two so I firmly believe

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,440
that these two groups needs to work much

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,730
much closer together to kind of speed up

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:12,200
that we're moving the industry quicker

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:14,680
going forward so I would like them to

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,530
introduce we are working very close with

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,650
Bryson on 5d here in North America I

00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,270
think it's also very good the sense of

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,580
cobbler collaboration how we are working

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:29,530
together so it's a pleasure for me to

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:32,690
introduce mr. an elegant Apollo

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:35,780
executive director of architectural

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:43,040
planning within Verizon welcome Annie

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:45,680
thank you Matt thank you Matt and it's

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,290
really great to be here and last three

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,480
days has been revealing from a lot of

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,340
exciting conversations so thank you for

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,190
the Linux Foundation and team for

00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:59,720
organizing this as well but let me give

00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:02,570
you a perspective of what Verizon in the

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,030
context of the 5g as well as much more

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:08,570
importantly what the role of the

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,160
open-source is and for us how we are

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:15,590
looking that and some of the challenges

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,080
and the opportunities I mean the most

00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,410
the perspective I want to paint today is

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,390
that our customers are demanding

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,540
experiences which from our network

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,340
they're the ass from them is growing

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,080
every day right I mean they're asking

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,200
for experiences which can be delivered

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,630
by a network which is which can be

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,220
driven by whether it's 5g or it's

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,680
stitched together with their network and

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,530
connectivity fabric it's its core of a

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,870
core of our fabric but much more

00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,120
importantly what we are kind of enabling

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,850
there is trying to deliver the services

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,680
for our customers which are new which

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,810
they have not experienced before

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,950
there but they're asking for low latency

00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,860
services whether they're asking for you

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,589
know use cases which are like v2x was as

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,360
you know mobility experiences which they

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,700
have not kind of experienced in the past

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,709
right the way we are driving that is

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:14,450
obviously in the core of this one is

00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:17,180
five g 5g enables low latency 5g enables

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:19,399
ultra bandwidth but we are also kind of

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,730
driving that with putting the fiber much

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:24,350
more closer to the customers but 5g also

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,720
enables us to look at our network

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,940
completely differently right in the from

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,490
the we are transforming our network in

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:34,070
the perspective of that it gives us a

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,040
way to take a step back we look at that

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,040
and the in the perspective like laying

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,589
out you know whether it is like redoing

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,440
the slicing of the network or building

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:48,350
enabling pushing the compute much more

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,850
closer to the customer because once you

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,529
push the compute much more closer to the

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,140
customers we can enable services like

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:56,320
you know whether it's mixed reality

00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,310
which demand like 10 to 20 milli

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,800
milliseconds latency from the network

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:04,100
whether it's via video X which are much

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,220
much lower latency requirements but

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,260
underline underlining that is a fabric

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,300
what we kind of fundamentally believe in

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,180
three pillars and within Verizon it's

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,410
divin its software control right I mean

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,080
we drive with the software-defined

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,570
networks but much more importantly we

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,490
are focusing on closed loop automation

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,580
with cognitive fabric and putting AI

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,010
upfront in there and then the other most

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:32,360
important block is not an aftermath but

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:34,190
it's open source the three main things

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,670
were the open source enables us for us

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,380
is very selfishly right I think it takes

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,270
the complexity out of the network from

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,880
the perspective we spend a lot of the

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,250
time you know looking at integrating

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,959
these the services making sure they're

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,149
working together interoperability that's

00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:51,709
where we spend time and we make sure

00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:56,779
that network is up and running all the

00:16:51,709 --> 00:17:00,200
time but then if the standards are good

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:02,450
and open-source works as it is we can

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,339
focus much more on driving what what our

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,970
customer needs are right I mean we want

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,280
to take the cost out of the

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,550
we want to focus on what delivering the

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,510
services on the on the layers are right

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:18,179
again for us Network OS is the the co

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:20,880
fundamental portion of it it gives us

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,179
the agility and it is driving the

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,800
services what we are customers annealing

00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,890
but there is obviously some challenges

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,020
with open source as we look at it right

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:33,179
there's I mean we are participating a

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,940
lot of the groups but as some of you

00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,010
would agree here is that there's a lot

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,210
of subgroups forming in pretty quickly

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,980
and there's very less time for us to

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:47,179
focus on each one of these subgroups and

00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,650
to participate in it I mean our biggest

00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:51,510
challenge is that you know I mean it's

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,820
like almost like a new shiny object that

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,700
some of us are running into that one

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,790
what I asked and probably look at

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,380
inwardly is that you know we we should

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,870
not I mean at least frost from this

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,820
community is that let's try to make sure

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,130
and work together to make a buildable

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,290
solution right I mean let's get the

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,240
reference architecture right let's get

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,800
the blocks right make sure that is

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,990
working before we move on to the next

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,000
project

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:21,000
again as you whether it's a start-up or

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,340
a large vendor I think everyone has

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,620
resource constraints let's focus on the

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:30,179
needs of the business again going back

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:32,220
to the previous conversation it's like

00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,660
more about I want to focus more on

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,520
delivering the services rather than

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,200
trying to fix the interoperability

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,360
issues and the other challenges in the

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,250
network and inwardly looking

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,040
self-critical right I mean we are trying

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,600
to change our mindset as well that we

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,370
want to move from one single

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,160
accountability we want to be multi

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,929
vendor we want to encourage the

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,370
ecosystem to collaborate and work

00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,830
together and we're going to be right

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,660
there with us again it's a mind shift

00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,910
change and we kind of embarked on that

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,850
culture and then we kind of investing in

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,070
that right but some of these barriers

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,080
about you know making sure that there's

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,660
not too many sub projects and there's

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,240
interoperability I think is is is I

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,620
think it's it's slowing us down I think

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,710
we need to get you a deployable

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,480
solutions I definitely ask this

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,960
community for that house

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,720
and most importantly what am I asking my

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,080
vendor community here right I mean again

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,780
we're not here to drive you know

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,730
basically it's not a race to zero right

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,340
we want you to take the reference

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:38,610
architectures and/or the open source and

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,920
innovate but make it multi vendor

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,990
interoperable part is paid in that

00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,880
ecosystem right I mean end of the day

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,790
whether it's a small vendor or

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,330
disruptive vendor startup I think that's

00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,950
the notion what we we model what we

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,020
would like to embrace embrace as well

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,980
right I mean we want to make sure that

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,810
you know it's it's compatible it's at

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,490
the same time it is simple enough for me

00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,580
to put it in my network and then I'm

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,220
able to expedite the introduction of the

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,530
technologies whether it's 5g versus any

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,660
other network end of the day I want to

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,450
focus on delivering the network I mean

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,330
services for my customer and we are

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:21,150
right there by providing the the

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,970
commitment from outside is by we are

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:26,870
investing in resources we are going to

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:29,430
commit the code back to the community as

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,010
appropriate and when whenever it makes

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:35,190
sense but we want to make sure that the

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:38,090
networks are simple and we are able to

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:42,080
innovate pretty quickly on top of it

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:44,760
that's the fine last from me and again

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,990
this great partnership in this community

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,520
I mean a lot of this stuff would not

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,770
have been done without a lot of the

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,310
contribution from you guys here in this

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,140
community again we thank we can't thank

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,120
you enough on that but there we also see

00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,160
there's a lot of work left trying to

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,930
especially when you look at 5g there's a

00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,350
lot of work left tip for us to

00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:07,380
accelerate and make it interoperable so

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:10,350
thank you and with that probably we'll

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,470
take some questions here well yeah thank

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,470
you

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:20,900
think about some very limited time for

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:24,400
questions but one maybe we have

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,549
questions so very good I like it or no

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,010
okay

00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:33,380
so I'll ask a question very fascinating

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,919
progress I know you know you guys are

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:39,710
leaders in this space and all that give

00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,720
us a little bit of a timing you know

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,700
there's there's the marketing guys you

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,799
know five g's here and I can make a call

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:50,120
and then there is the engineers which

00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:52,640
will be 2025 what is the reality maybe I

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,740
can stop I think actually the core

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,809
network and the orchestration solution I

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,940
think we already more or less that today

00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:00,380
with these type of networks I think we

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,970
have to wait some time for this kind of

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,830
a new radio it's not about that I think

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,020
from the core network perspective assess

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,760
I think we are I mean we have closed

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,070
feedback loop thinking today we have

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,350
that in our systems and 5g is here now

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,230
what we are really looking Radio has

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:17,419
worked extent extremely well we are

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,919
progressing with the trials and I think

00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:22,909
what we are looking at is the

00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,649
opportunity to redo redefine the core

00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:27,169
network as well in a way that it can

00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:28,880
scale and work with it and it's it's I

00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:29,899
think we're on the right path and we'll

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,000
get there pretty quickly

00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:32,680
very good thank you very much thank you

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,079
thanks

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,079
