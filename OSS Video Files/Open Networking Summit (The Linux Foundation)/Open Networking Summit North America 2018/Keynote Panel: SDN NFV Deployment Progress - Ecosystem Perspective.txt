next is one of the most interesting

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:12,210
panels that you can listen to we have

00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,700
one carrier from each continent right so

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,000
we have someone from Asia someone from

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,550
Europe someone from us obviously and

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,750
they're going to talk about the

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,910
deployment progress so we're going to

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,090
bring the vision down to earth and then

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,380
you have three fantastic vendors who

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,360
have been participating in this

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,110
deployment revolution so so we're going

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,320
to sort of bring it down a notch and see

00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:42,510
where these things are heading and what

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
are some of the successes what are some

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,070
of the missing things challenges etc so

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,930
with that I'm going to just have the

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,860
panel come in and introduce themselves

panel and my name is Alan Goldman I work

00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,600
for em dogs I'm director of Technology

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,100
Strategy and standardization and also a

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,439
member of technical steering committee

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,549

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,380
panelists to introduce yourself please

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,840
and some headlines about your companies

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,060
thank you all right

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,179
thank you very much really appreciate

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,030
being being part of this panel

00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:43,039
my name is IU Sharma I'm heading the

00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,149
Engineering and Technology function for

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:49,670
a disruptive and relatively new company

00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:53,390
called reliance geo backed by Reliance

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:56,869
group we offer connectivity cloud and

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,450
compute services right now in India

00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:02,420
region and we hope to expand

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,000
internationally on connectivity we have

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:09,800
about approximately 180 million

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,220
subscribers pure LT wall say and our

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,440
aspiration is to achieve 400 million by

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,709
the end of this year average data

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,599
consumption is about 12 gig and we hope

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:26,599
to take it to 20 gig by the end of this

00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:28,220
year so on the on the compute I'm sorry

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,290
on the cloud side we are relatively new

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,980
and we're building our edge cloud

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,569
strategy and on the content we had

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,230
actually was very flattened flattering

00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:41,870
to hear comments from Reed Hastings

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,330
about every country should have reliance

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,280
Geo so that tells us that we're doing

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,379
something something interesting in that

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,900
space being disruptive in this market so

00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,099
what what we our chain man's vision is

00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:00,319
to twofold

00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:02,950
with this cloud content and and and sort

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,640
of connectivity services two most

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:10,040
important factors are first superior

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,540
user experience and second is superior

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,909
user experience at the

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,040
economies of scale and open source is

00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:18,769
very very vital part of our technical

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,019
strategy moving forward we're doing a

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:23,090
variety of open source projects and that

00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,950
when putting open source in production

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,220
brings its own set of challenges and and

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,590
opportunities and we'll talk we'll share

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,680
our views with the community here and

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,230
looking forward to sort of getting a

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,840
feedback also from the community hearing

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,930
from the panel as well as offline you

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:49,489
know meeting with you guys to get your

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:52,489
feedback as well I am from orange and

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,560
I'm leading in Orange transformation

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,139
program that is called on-demand

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,480
networks and that is about the

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:04,519
implementation of Sdn and IV with the

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,269
explicit intent to leverage this on

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:12,230
demand promises so it means that we can

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:17,030
have drivers that are from the b2b

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:19,729
business so either in a defensive

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,270
approach or in a business development

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:26,510
approach maybe I should have said that

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,510
we have 28 countries as a footprint

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,720
mainly in Europe and in Africa and that

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,900
also explains the diversity of

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,539
approaches of and of deployment strategy

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,669
that we can have in orange because of

00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:43,520
course these countries are not at the

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:46,220
same level of maturity at the same level

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,970
of competition they do not have the same

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:53,409
stakes so as I said it could be either

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,289
the b2b a business development or

00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:59,000
defensive approach that is an incentive

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:02,360
and that is clearly developing this

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,409
on-demand Network promise from a

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,789
portfolio standpoint or it can be the

00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:09,789
agility promise

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,580
it's reducing the time to market if we

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,530
are thinking about marketing questions

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,350
oh it's reducing the time to deliver

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,470
time to repair if we focus on the

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:29,590
operations and that's where of course we

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:36,010
are quite concerned by the automation

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:41,060
and the last let's say driver that could

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:44,350
country gofer is the advent of the

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,360
five-year or the anticipation of the 5t

00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:50,690
with of course all the business

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:56,540
opportunities also it drives the IOT

00:05:50,690 --> 00:06:01,910
near for example all the announcement of

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:07,790
T of the mobile mobile connectivity so

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:14,150
here is basically the orange orange

00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:18,230
taken standpoint as we consider this Sdn

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:21,410
and I video transformation great hi I'm

00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:24,410
Chris rice I'm responsible for network

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:27,730
function vertol is it virtualization in

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,500
software-defined networking within AT&T

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,200
design and automation associated with

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,410
that we've been at this a little while

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,180
we have the experience associated with

00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,150
some of the early work there in that

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,130
area it's largely my teams that have

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,410
been involved in some of the things that

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,960
you saw are put put up there in terms of

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,730
a crane oh and Don Oh sand and onap and

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,600

networks in the world and optical

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,260
transport infrastructure but also

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,420
through our acquisition of cyan years

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,700
ago now have the industry-leading

what we're building into our portfolio

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,270
and how that aligns with open source and

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,430
what

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,560
projects to be involved in and and and

the opportunity to be on the panel hi my

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,730
name is ron Hubbard man from Nokia

00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,010
software specifically I run what we call

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,850
emerging products in okiya software we

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,800
build technologies to be used by

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:49,550
connected intelligence digital

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,040
experience or on automation etc units

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,940
within my shop include cloud and cloud

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,750
band IOT cyber security digital channel

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,360
and and so on and so on as well as the

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:07,190
incubator where we build ideas into

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,930
products and then businesses in enoki

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,840
aren't we were connected to open source

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,120
for quite some time very much attached

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,730
to to this space I'll talk about it a

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,680
little bit later but we also have as

00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,620
probably most of you know quite a wide

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,300
portfolio that spans truly you know

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,220
everything from the house connectivity

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:29,870
optical radio routing switching etc now

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,240
which gives us quite a bit of a good

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,220
perspective on you know how to connect

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,880
the old with the new and and I know that

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,600
you know we'll talk a lot probably about

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,840
orchestration and what it takes to

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,690
actually operationalize networks in this

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,270
you know mixed reality of you know all

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:50,350
to a next generation is what keeps me up

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:54,140
at night at least these days me too

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,900
thank you very much so moving on and you

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,850
know I would like to ask to talk about

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,860
anaphase day and and clearly you know

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,530
speaking of my own company and if he is

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,050
DNS seen as a key strategic area for us

00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,120
and yeah contributing and you can

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,370
involved in on up and I would like to

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,010
ask each of you to explain what you

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,560
company did in NFV sdn area and

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:19,670
specifically for open source in the past

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,820
years yeah I mean we've been obviously

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,860
relatively new player but still given

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,250
that you know within two years of span

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:33,170
what we've done utilizing open source I

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,620
think it's incredible so we've built geo

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,760
Manno

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,010
which we call it a platform based

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,880
Oh nap which is in pre-production

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:45,980
already and we plan to bring that into

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:49,500
production fairly soon we have also

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,780
built our own Sdn controller platform

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,920
again that is compatible with both

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,900
owners and opendaylight and we are going

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,560
to introduce slowly in phased manner

00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:05,210
into the production network we are

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,650
embarking on the journey to explore and

00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,840
first phase would be more leveraging

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,820
open source and second phase would be as

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,800
we build up more open source chorus to

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,290
contribute is into what we call

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,710
integrated tech as we moving towards 5g

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:22,110
IOT and Mac architectures so in the IOT

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,070
we already started working obviously

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:28,760
leveraging some of the open source

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:32,040
platform B code to kind of build that

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,160
platform and then build the connectivity

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,260
data and then either sort of intelligent

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,580
services on top of it on 5g and mech

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,060
again so we have a disaggregation

00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:49,020
strategy which is radio router and cloud

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:53,910
and within the 5g span we have started

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:57,660
to explore X ran and we have started to

00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:00,480
already test in the lab oh no space X

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,370
ran and we are also working with some of

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,220
the vendors who have hardened dextran

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:09,930
controller and we plan to put that in

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:12,780
our phase 2 of Massimo Massimo trials

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:15,830
face one of Massimo trials is already

00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,450
over so we had some learnings from those

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,700
Massimo trial but in the second phase

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:24,590
what we implant to do is I intend to do

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:27,240
is is introduce centralized controller

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,010
and we will compare whether pure

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,310
open-source controller works well or

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,880
vendor backed open-source platform works

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,860
well and based on pure merits will sort

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,650
of introduce that into a production

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,740
network and then build some value

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,690
propositions on top of it and the

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,059
challenges or the use cases are first

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,619
one being video because our network

00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:53,859
hammered with video as you would imagine

00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:56,739
and we want to obviously use the X ran

00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:58,329
for to improve the end-user experience

00:11:56,739 --> 00:12:00,879
and keep our network free from video

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:03,759
second is more to deal with the external

00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,919
and internal and sort of interference

00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,259
and third is on building the sort of

00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,529
control logic on top of it so in radio

00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:14,709
we're doing that in sort of IP or white

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:17,619
box switches so we already talking to

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:20,559
directly to the chipset vendors and we

00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:22,719
are also exploring stratum Dinah's and

00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,089
it was glad I was glad to see there is a

00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:27,759
some synergy between different switching

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:30,309
operating systems so we obviously want

00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,619
to leverage a open source which in

00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:34,569
operating systems and we want to build

00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,639
that and then ask the vendors to bring

00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:39,729
the value differentiations in terms of

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,879
vnfs how it comes into play and then cut

00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:44,619
it across iot whether it's IOT gateway

00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,049
whether that's a you know what should we

00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:50,649
be you box going into the white box or

00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:52,899
it's in the cloud or in the data centers

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:54,399
etc so that is a very important and a

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,229
white project where we are already

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,929
embarking on that journey and it's very

00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:59,679
encouraging to see sort of AT&T taking

00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:01,929
lead on that

00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,989
so and we will obviously collaborate

00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:07,359
with AT&T Deutsche Telekom and many

00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:09,759
other providers and and work towards

00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:11,829
that sort of end desirable goal and

00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,099
third and last point what is is a

00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:18,519
optical which is a kind of a a big big

00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:21,489
you know sticking point to introduce

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:24,279
open source there because of you know

00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:27,399
valid reasons we started to sort of take

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:30,959
wager which is coming out from the tip

00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:34,569
program as a kind of benchmark and then

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,179
harden that sort of voyage rod and part

00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:39,969
and build the sort of values around it

00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:42,789
and that is we are talking to different

00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:46,089
vendors as well as we are working with

00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:49,989
academia both in US as well as in India

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:53,019
it be at Stanford AIA T's or other

00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:55,629
places as well to see how we can sort of

00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:57,579
build that and introduce into the metro

00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:59,349
networks in the FT th when we are

00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:00,999
offering those kind of services so three

00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:02,710
big areas where open source index

00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:07,180
aggregation plays the important role

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:09,730
radio and x-ray white boxes in operating

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,610
system and third in the optical very

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,010
clearly obviously building using Voyager

00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,660
as the model or as the benchmark and

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,700
building sort of that lives on top of it

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,490
so the message is to our renders is loud

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,950
clear sort of in a wait or go being

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,410
extinct sort of sort of that is the sort

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,670
of journey and that's the passion and

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,130
that's the omission we are driving

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,200
towards to sort of mobilize to four

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,270
hundred million customers and with that

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:40,810
superior user experience with 5g and

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:45,610
mech services thank you so when orange

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:49,480
as as I said we're at the key point a

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:52,750
key turn in our deployment which is we

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:59,140
can consider that the phase make it

00:14:52,750 --> 00:15:02,339
happen is done since we have a portfolio

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:06,490
or enough air for big multinational

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:10,390
companies the of the network as a

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:14,170
service type and that we are launching

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:18,120
or about to launch sd1 our offer also

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:24,400
for smaller segments of the b2b market

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:27,520
domestic level and we are also deploying

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:32,279
currently or infrastructure or yes

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:37,330
infrastructure by the way based on

00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:41,220
OpenStack and about also two to deploy

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:45,310
the core network the mobile core network

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:49,660
in a virtualized in as a virtualized

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:52,120
function so the make it happen

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,089
stage is done and now we have the

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,180
challenge to make it at scale as I said

00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,410
we have 28 countries so it means a huge

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,400
step

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:06,950
and also of course we do not intend to

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:11,260
to stay at this level of the core

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:14,900
network but go to the edge and that

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:20,660
especially the the need for the 5g at

00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:25,730
the end of the of the day so this is our

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,550
status let's say and what do we expect

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,760
from the open source you you said the

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,860
connecting the new with the old it's

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,750
also to get the best of the two worlds

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:41,420
that are the network one on the IT world

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:44,390
and not the worst and I think where it's

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:49,280
where the open source can really had

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:52,580
have an added value and proof its added

00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:56,500
value because it allows a fast

00:16:52,580 --> 00:17:04,250
innovation and it allows standardization

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:09,500
as I said previously we need automation

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:14,959
and we need a sustainable value chain

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:18,829
and for these two specific focus I think

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,050
that the open source communities that we

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,839
are involved in on it's a special

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:28,400
talking about own app for the first case

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:34,160
for the automation and I believe in PN

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:37,040
MP for the second well I think that as

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:42,100
well as enough of course I think that

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:47,900
where the open source dynamics is really

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:51,590
and we we clearly invest in orange in

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:54,740
these fields in these specific fields we

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:58,360
have also interests as as you mentioned

00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:02,720
are fairly white box question on a

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:07,840
universal CPE a question and I have

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:11,360
mentioned that we are working about the

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,400
portfolio for the b2b but it's also a

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,060
potential

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:21,760
opportunity for the Walsall market that

00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:23,680
we have a look on also we know Andre

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,200
kind of went through our journey in his

00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,540
keynote you know we had very public

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,950
goals you know that John Donovan was

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:35,290
nice enough to give us early on and you

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,420
know when we first started we really

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,860
didn't have a big interest in open

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,970
source to be honest with you in fact we

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,300
thought this was going to be some of our

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,250
secret sauce in the way that that we did

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,410
this and then you know kind of as our

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,660
work evolved and our thinking evolved we

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,250
realized it was probably better to get

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,770
more people involved and to get a bigger

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,980
community involved so that this could be

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,570
a wider phenomenon if you will than just

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,840
a teen teen we had a lot of discussions

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,850
with you know aligned of folks and some

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,030
of whom are on this panel early on

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,130
around those areas but you know we've

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,560
had goals of you know 55 percent last

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,320
year 65 percent this year 75 percent by

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,870
2020 so those again very public goals I

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,060
think one of the things that's helped us

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,800
is that experience that I talked about

00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,970
in the experience that we'll be able to

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,620
leverage in 5g so it'll kind of be born

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,450
in the cloud I don't think we'd be

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,920
confident enough to say it would be born

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,810
in the cloud if we hadn't gone through

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,720
what we have gone through and the work

00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:37,930
that we've done in you know from our

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,110
standpoint we see more and more

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:44,620
opportunity with open source and I think

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:48,460
around the community in general because

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,200
while no single one of us in terms of

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,780
communication service providers is as

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,210
big as some of the hyper scale together

00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,800
we're bigger than all of them right and

00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,270
I and I think that that's really kind of

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,520
the message I'd like to leave this group

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,460
with is like how we work together as a

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,990
community for that common kind of 80 90

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,720
percent kind of overlap that we have

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,400
that we get benefit from and then you

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,630
know with a specialization that we talk

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,420
about will probably be that other 10%

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,820
that'll be unique to AT&T you need to

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:19,780
rely on unique to Orange or whoever else

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:23,440
is in that mix and I think that that is

00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:25,730
a big benefit for overall for this

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,280
community as well as the vendors to

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,710
to be honest with you because again they

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,240
benefit and by commonality that they get

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,610
something they can reuse over and over

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,950
and over again and to that extent you

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,930
know I think us working together will

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,820
certainly help that so I think you know

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,470
in terms of open source like again what

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,610
we're doing here I think is you know we

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,500
talked about at all the different

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,150
projects but one thing I'd like to talk

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,760
about is you know and Andre mentioned a

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,520
little bit about this is onf and I think

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,080
early on some work there was very

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,990
interesting and kind of directionally

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,220
correct but it really didn't kind of get

00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,990
over that hump but it was needed to

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,450
really put it into production and I know

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,340
that a lot of folks have worked really

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,350
hard on kind of making some substantive

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,970
changes there and get more community

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,710
input more communication service

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,390
provider input so that can actually be

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,760
something that's truly a reference

00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,290
design that's leverageable in production

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,910
that takes into account operational

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,800
needs and everything else and so that

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,050
kind of thing in addition to just open

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,770
source I applaud that kind of work and I

00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:26,420
think we need more of that

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,160
so Siena has been very involved in open

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,100
source for really the entire history of

00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,930
the blue planet platform in fact Blue

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,230
Planet incorporates over 30 open source

00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:38,270
projects today but we've realized that

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,950
open source is fantastic as a catalyst

00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,810
to really accelerate but it's not free

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,100
it takes investment actually harden and

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,650
deliver it packaged and be able to

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,440
deploy it manage it and in fact at this

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,850
show we've announced as of this morning

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,100
that we're incorporating the own app

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,620
policy framework into to augment our

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,660
blue planet own existing policy

00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,340
framework and we think that that's

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,050
absolutely critical as it gives a new

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,720
capability for us to be able to serve

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,650
our customers better we're very

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,020
interested in driving the

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,840
standardisation of policy definition and

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,090
the language of policy itself because

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,130
frankly we believe that policy becomes a

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:16,640
fundamental component of automation in

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,140
general policy will enable us to drive

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,910
cost out through standardization and

00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,650
create better more unique experiences

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,650
but also ones that can be operated in a

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,200
more Universal fashion the challenge

00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,150
will be to define policy language that

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,060
actually works across carriers and works

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,700
within a carriers to multiplicity of

00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,470
operations environments and I to share

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,590
your concern about bridging kind of the

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,880
old with the new we're

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,549
probably gonna be in a hybrid Network

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,929
situation for a very long time and we

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,549
need to be able to leverage that that's

00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,890
core value that the service providers

00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,659
have we need to bridge that gap if you

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,669
will between sort of the existing

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,590
infrastructure and all the new in a

00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,760
policy controlled way so we're really

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,919
excited about it we're real familiar

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,650
with it we will definitely be embracing

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,480
the onap policy and we'll be making

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:05,490
contributions back and run bug fixes and

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:08,549
so forth where do I start I mean last

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:13,169
year was was truly a leap year I think

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:16,169
for 4nf years as an industry we have now

00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:18,260
started just last year over 90 new

00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:21,929
projects you know all over the world

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:26,149
over 70 of them include cloud band from

00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:28,409
a mono portfolio perspective alone we

00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:30,570
said from the beginning that this movie

00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:33,000
needs to be multi vendor and an open

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,340
environment and boy did last year prove

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,179
that it's possible right we have you

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:41,370
know over 450 types of vnfs that have

00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,909
been integrated across these different

00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:48,000
projects more than a third of them come

00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:50,490
from different vendors usually our

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,980
direct competitors which makes it always

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:58,260
fun we increase our investment in open

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,240
source quite drastically not just within

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,899
my team and Nokia software but across

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,640
the board in Nokia we have some projects

00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:08,070
that we started you know like meteorite

00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,130
which I'm very proud of part of

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,840
OpenStack root cause analysis we spend

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,200
quite a bit of resources in in things

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,549
like maestro for for workflow and a few

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,380
others

00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:21,899
but across all the different

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,610
organizations right starting with you

00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:26,970
know with the contribution that ona

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:30,539
brought I think we're now in the top

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:33,390
five adding more and more developers all

00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:35,700
the time working on you know a

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,520
integration hardening but also bringing

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,860
more of the components and compatibility

00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,760
you know into the ionic components

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,020
across the entire Nokia portfolio if you

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,660
don't remember how many hundreds of

00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:52,060
products we have to work with

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,070
now I have to share Opie NFC also very

00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,800
very important making a lot of

00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:00,100
investment in doctor I think it's

00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,540
critical to to the industry and maybe

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:05,200
just you know from from an intent

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:08,590
internal transformation perspective we

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,940
created a couple of years ago a group we

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,180
call the common Software Foundation

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:18,190
which is you know what we internally use

00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:20,110
to essentially industrialize the use of

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,660
open source and and more importantly

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:25,660
kind of like separate the business logic

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,000
of the different software pieces you

00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,740
know that the VNS you know from

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,960
everything else you know everything that

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:35,170
you know we would consider

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,120
infrastructure and basically end of last

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:40,780
year we you know we finished camp the

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,240
first round of getting most vnfs on on

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,600
this on these components and the

00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,090
blueprints coming out of this team which

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,760
helps both ourselves obviously and the

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,520
community given that we are truly

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,920
industrializing the use and centralizing

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,680
how these components blueprints and in

00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:04,780
turn the past layer would be managed

00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:06,640
across all of our Vienna's moving to the

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,830
next question actually now and looking

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,050
on this same audience this is the right

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,880
audience actually to resolve the

00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:15,040
technical issues and the challenges we

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,320
face so either I would like to ask you

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:21,520
to build one challenge that you find as

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,590
a major one for 2018 and why you see

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,850
this as a challenge and for this

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:34,030
audience to resolve this sure I clearly

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:37,000
see it three but I'll stick to one let

00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:40,420
me mention three just so interphase is

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,400
one which is the biggest one second one

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,800
I see perception and third one system

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,830
integration so I'll maybe stick to the

00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:51,640
first one which is the topmost is the

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:54,610
unless and until the vendor community do

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,740
not open the interfaces I'll take a

00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:00,520
radio as an example so if you're doing

00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:03,070
extra mass in my more field trials my

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,500
message was bit strong but again our

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:08,320
like to reiterate that message that in a

00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,899
wait or go extinct so there are vendors

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,630
which are or they're emerging vendors

00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:15,759
which are embracing that and they will

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:20,409
open the interfaces to radio network

00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:22,960
right so that is very very vital for the

00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:26,080
innovation to happen that was just an

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,649
example and I could go on lot in such

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,210
examples but this is very very important

00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:33,730
for the innovation this is very

00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:37,990
important for us to solve video problems

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:40,720
at the edge which is you know vast

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,240
majority of traffic the service Reuter

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,889
that hammered web and they make a very

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,080
little revenue and it's a common problem

00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:49,929
so if we could solve that user

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,259
experience problem and have the Sonde's

00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:55,870
media agnostic sounds using these

00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:57,909
controller interfaces and have those

00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,070
vendors open those interfaces I think

00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:03,429
that will be in favor of the community

00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:05,740
that'll be in favor of everybody with

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:08,350
the providers as well as for the new

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,029
players to come in to play so I would

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:16,720
reserve my comments on the second and

00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:19,240
third one from my standpoint I will come

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,799
back to the industrialization strike as

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:26,559
a run mention but from the standpoint of

00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:29,950
the village and I think that the key

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,769
point here is collectively on that way

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:35,679
there sodium's is relevant to make the

00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:41,769
value chain viable sustainable and

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:44,379
viable and this means that yes we have

00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:49,830
this point of opening the interfaces and

00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:52,950
so on maybe going to a point of

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:57,429
standardization for the NFB I probably

00:28:52,950 --> 00:29:01,059
so we can at the end of today stick to D

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:04,600
Sdn and I fit promises because I fear

00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:10,150
that today we diverge from this initial

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:15,880
promises not our the agility basically

00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:19,720
and that's more or less claims very kind

00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,830
of pure cloud model and the decoupling

00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:27,120
model between the telco cloud and the

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:31,900
application running on the top of it and

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:36,419
so to come back to your question for me

00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:41,260
and and we have levers of several

00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,620
actions beside but behind mixed-use

00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,970
mylan

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:48,370
this is this question of the value chain

00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,240
that probably we are struggling with

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:54,820
today

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:58,659
that could have some ambiguity in the in

00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:01,630
the behavioral factors of course because

00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:04,659
we have to accept that we disrupt our

00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,260
business model and it's a risk for all

00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:09,399
of us

00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:14,309
but at the end of the day we could

00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:17,919
probably keep value with shivers and

00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:23,770
leverage these promises if we deliver

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:25,919
them that's good you know I I really

00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:29,200
want to cover there's there's probably

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,399
one big area but but I won't make sure

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,870
people understand where I think this

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,779
fits so when we first looked at this we

00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,520
said where can we go apply Sdn and

00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:38,440
network function virtualization and

00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,080
somewhat similar thuggin we said look we

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,970
can apply that in our IP core we can

00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,490
apply that in our Metro Packer core I

00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:48,820
could play that in our wireless core the

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,950
mobile ran with Iran and other things we

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,960
can apply it and IP services we can ply

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,159
it at premises equipment so I want to

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,470
make sure that when I talk about this

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,460
everyone understands that's the the

00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,500
world that we're talking about to a

00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,210
fairly big world it's not just wired

00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,559
it's not just Wireless it's a fairly big

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,970
world I think that the time and this

00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,289
kind of gets to automation and the

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,500
interfaces and everything else but the

00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:13,940
time to onboard

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,160
you know I think it's it's time to

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,950
change that and what I mean by that is

00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,320
it you know early on all these were

00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,270
unique and everybody was learning but

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,970
right now I think we've got a much

00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:27,770
better idea of what a Lego block should

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,710
look like as opposed to a snowflake and

00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:32,180
in different areas of those areas I just

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,220
described some people have done a really

00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,800
good job of making it easy to on board

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,870
and others haven't and I think it's time

00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,080
for the vendors in those areas to step

00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:44,090
up because I think in fairness a lot of

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,100
the service providers here have stepped

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,660
up they've they've gotten on very common

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,460
platforms they've gotten on common

00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,350
automation and we're trying to make it

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,440
easier for those vendors to be able to

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:57,170
deliver commonality to us you know Lego

00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,300
blocks and and I think that this year

00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,700
that's something that I know we're going

00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,930
to drive very hard both in open source

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,930
as well as within AT&T

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,130
yeah so Siena software services business

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,320
really exists to help our service

00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:15,620
provider customers solve automation

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,150
problems and we also have seen that sort

00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:20,420
of one size architecture it hasn't

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:22,010
really fit all circumstances and so

00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,870
anything we can do to the in the

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:26,210
community who have been a huge recipient

00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,320
of value from open-source as I said but

00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,240
anything we can do as a community to

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,130
even drive further standardization of

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,140
those Lego blocks how things really do

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,150
work together what interfaces are there

00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,680
then I think we have a better chance to

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,450
really enable greater levels of

00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,040
automation and lower cost to be able to

00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,110
be more agile like I think everyone on

00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,120
the panel really wants so for us it's

00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,040
about integration interfaces and

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,960
definitions and languages and so forth

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,240
so that we we know the target were to

00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,980
comply to to drive those benefits that

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,260
we're all looking to get out of industry

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,480
so a customer of mine asked me you know

00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:02,810
recently can you please you know stop

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,210
bringing me a lot of new things and and

00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:10,550
help me use write the stuff that is

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:13,520
there and you know it actually have

00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:16,580
joking but it's very serious because I

00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:20,360
think we reached a point where my ask is

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:22,850
think simplification we have a lot of

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,210
pieces we have a lot of code we have a

00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,419
lot

00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,820
ability but it's complicated right it

00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:31,580
takes quite a lot of effort pretty much

00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,860
across the chain right from from getting

00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,039
it together for building it installing

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,590
it managing it onboarding the vnfs and

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,620
managing you know the vnfs once once

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:45,140
they're on board and and the piece that

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:47,390
is missing in is the simplification that

00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,970
I think is critical and if I may just

00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:51,860
talk about the the suggestion of how to

00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,820
solve it I would ask that you know the

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:58,159
developers think of the operations guy

00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:02,000
right or girl that needs to come there

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,419
and without understanding right all the

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,130
details of the code make use right of

00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:09,349
the system for the purpose it's there

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:13,550
for the purpose being you know moving

00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:17,300
bits in providing service and add your

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:21,460
design based on on that basic user in

00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,460
mind right as opposed to detect itself

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,080
but all of you say it which is basically

00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:32,419
about openness modularity these are thin

00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,359
agility this is probably the things that

00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:38,030
we need to concentrate on in the near

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,000
future with that thank you very much

00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,960
thank you thank you

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,909
[Applause]

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,610
[Music]

00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:49,659
[Applause]
