good morning just trying to wake you

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:09,480
guys up from the parting thank you for

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,580
coming and you know thank you for all

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,650
the hallway feedback we have received

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,609
everybody is like really excited about

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,920
the content this year and you know that

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:24,300
can't get enough of it so appreciate the

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,980
feedback yesterday we heard from some of

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,149
the top carriers and we got an amazing

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:35,670
understanding of not just the vision but

00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:38,790
the 2018 challenges down to earth in

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:43,110
terms of deployment today we're going to

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,850
hear from enterprises and cloud and of

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,340
course you know some of the carrier use

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,879
cases but it's a different perspective

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,520
and as I showed yesterday they are all

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,590
coming together in terms of technology

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,320
and building blocks so before we get

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,800
started I have a few housekeeping things

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,660
that I want to highlight the first one a

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,990
reminder tonight

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,510
there's a reception and a booth crawl at

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,960
the fore and as soon as the session ends

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,180
you do have to check out the boots I did

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
walk through and saw a lot of you guys

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,619
doing it now of course you know coming

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,049
in coming at the expense of sessions

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,430
well that's a balance but thank you for

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,229
doing that that's it that's the chance

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,259
and fill out the ONS survey this is it

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,520

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,020
who filled it out last year you will see

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,960
the changes that have been implemented

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,750
this year there are subtle changes but

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,880
they are that the events team takes them

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,130
very very seriously right so your

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,140
feedback is extremely important to us

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,600
okay so those with those two

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,560
