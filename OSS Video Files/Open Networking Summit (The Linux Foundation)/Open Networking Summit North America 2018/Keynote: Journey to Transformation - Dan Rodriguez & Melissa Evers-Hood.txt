it's truly great to be here at ons and

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,560
part of this really vibrant and strong

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,840
open-source community as we truly drive

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:16,460
all sorts of innovations in a very open

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:18,810
way towards network transformation and

00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,939
when you come to think about it and you

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,430
think about our everyday lives and you

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,800
think about how we typically do spend

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,050
some time with technology each and every

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,779
day almost everything we do

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,840
somehow generates data that could be

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,940
simple emails texts or perhaps watching

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,030
a video with your family uploading your

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,260
video or even maybe tweeting about this

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,870
very conference all this generates data

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,820
but that amount of data truly pales in

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,620
comparison or just a drop in the bucket

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,039
when you compare it to the amount of

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,739
data

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,840
they'll be generated from machines use

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,840
cases such as autonomous driving as

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,670
another example and when I think about

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,800
data I truly think about it in a way

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,510
that what that will give all of us in

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,330
this room all sorts of opportunity to

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,900
deliver new economic value it will also

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,640
enhance our daily lives and two of my

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,060
favorite examples of how you can bring

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,619
data life rai and drones and through AI

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,780
and drones it will definitely enhance

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,470
our lives but also change industry

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,470
things such as search-and-rescue farming

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,409
security and even entertainment to name

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,290
another and in fact earlier this year at

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,090
the Korean Olympics Intel broke the

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,000
Guinness Book of World Record for the

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,100
largest drone show at the opening

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,890
ceremony of course powered by AI and

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,490
this was truly a spectacular show with

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,170
over 1200 drones and then when I take a

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,960
moment to think about my own life

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,110
outside of work and what my true passion

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,780
is I think about surfing and I truly

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,200
enjoy catching and riding waves with my

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,840
boys but sometimes not with my boys but

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,920
when I paddle out into what some may

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,590
deem as spooky waters or perhaps Sharky

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,229
waters and in those instances I do my

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,360
very best to try to not think about an

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,030
image but sometimes every once in a

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,520
while you think about posture

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,010
just beneath the surface the man in the

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,500
great great house excuse me the man in

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,620
the gray suit otherwise known as a great

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,520
white shark and again you try to forget

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,870
about that but Intel did innovate and

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,930
create it something called the move

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,390
idiot neural compute stick and that in

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,180
combination with drones can provide AI

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,820
and in this instance we partnered with

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,620
another ecosystem member and essentially

00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,230
what they did was they developed a drone

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,480
that could spot and detect sharks before

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,180
they arrived at areas where people were

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,610
surfing so this not only could help save

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,380
a ton of lives but it also can make that

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,870
everyday surf or that everyday life

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,480
experience so much better it's these

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,880
sorts of innovations that will truly

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,130
change the way we live our lives and

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,110
also create all sorts of economic

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:12,320
opportunities for all of us in this room

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:15,380
so data is truly the foundation of the

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,530
next wave of transformation really the

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:21,680
next wave of technical innovations from

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,430
things like autonomous driving ARV are

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,410
cloud gaming etc and we think about what

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,540
we need to do in this room we need to

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,760
fuel and inspire the network to be able

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,620
to support next generation services

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,690
running on gigabit LTE speeds as well as

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,840
5g and when you think about the vast

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,160
array of 5g use cases you of course

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,340
start thinking about how the network

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,829
truly needs to transform to a network

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,130
that is far more flexible far more

00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:54,799
automated and scalable than the one we

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,510
have today and with that underlying

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,940
characteristics of the network I do

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,340
believe we can bring out the best in 5g

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,480
and exploit that additional broadband

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,549
capability exploit machine-to-machine

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,370
communications in addition deliver all

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:12,829
sorts of low latency services but in

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,959
addition to this besides making it

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:17,570
flexible and scalable the network also

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,790
needs to be open to drive and fuel

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,130
innovation so whole host of different

00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,530
folks can create efficient virtual

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,150
network functions as well as new

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:33,449
services that will truly deliver a

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:36,389
amazing experiences to our customers now

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:38,729
we have been on this path really since

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,470
the early parts of the decade in the

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,600
beginning of this decade we really

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,180
focused on moving the industry from

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,800
fixed-function appliances to standard

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,020
base computing or commercial

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,240
off-the-shelf servers and since then

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,570
we've added virtualization deliver a

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,190
little bit of flexibility and we've seen

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,430
Communication Service fighters start to

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,910
do deployments now since those early

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:06,150
days new architectures and methodologies

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,220
have truly evolved to help us reach our

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,350
end goal is and that's to really deliver

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,210
more scale agility and flexibility on

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,960
the networks but also one that's more

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:18,990
automated more secure as well as service

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,470
assured now with that there's a ton of

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,840
hype around new cloud ready like

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,270
solutions and I do believe these will

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,669
have a very good home in our networks

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,340
but these capabilities and technologies

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:35,280
need to continue to evolve to ensure

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,020
we're meeting the needs of calm service

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,300
providers to be able to hit that sky

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,340
that scalability and flexibility but

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,870
also meet their underlying SLA

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:49,440
requirements now cloud service providers

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:52,770
they have truly harness their ability to

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,930
run and scale applications utilizing the

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,880
infrastructure and I do believe that

00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,849
calm service riders can apply many

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,740
lessons learned that that industry went

00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,990
through in adopting these technologies

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,610
and I do believe they need to keep the

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,270
boat their technical and business goals

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,979
top of mind when pursuing different

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,840
architectures and I do believe that

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,880
cloud ready or cloud native solutions

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,490
has their place but I do believe we need

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,020
to evolve that technology to allow calm

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,199
service providers to overcome barriers

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,780
both operationally organizationally as

00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,169
well as technically to deploy these

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,060
solutions and because of this Intel is

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,099
truly collaborating with the industry

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,889
working with the cloud Native community

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:37,020
working with the kubernetes team to

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:40,950
enable containerize environments that

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,870
meet network use cases

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,200
and in the near term with this in mind

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,660
we do anticipate more virtualized cloud

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,880
friendly like solutions being deployed

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,950
in the very near term and over the

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,720
longer term more cloud ready or more

00:06:52,950 --> 00:07:00,780
cloud native type solutions we are

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,670
seeing the effect and the impact of

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,580
network transformation really across the

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:09,330
network and both fixed and mobile in the

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,960
core in the access network and all the

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,750
way to customer premise equipment and in

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,270
the meantime our customers consumers and

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,940
businesses like continued demand new and

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,990
amazing experiences some at home and

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:28,260
some in the business place and we all

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,710
know that calm service riders typically

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,360
operate under very tight operational

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,800
capital budget so it's very challenging

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440
to keep up with the current demands as

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,390
well as they have the desire and all of

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,110
us have the need to truly plan for the

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:45,540
5g future and when you think about 5g

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,790
with those vast array of use cases we

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,220
truly believe the network needs to

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,140
become more horizontal in nature will

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,940
truly place computes throughout the

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,460
overall network and you can think about

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,610
having many data centers at several

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,530
points of presence in the network the

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,750
end goal being able to scale virtual

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,880
network functions truly seamlessly

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,320
throughout the network to win and

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,480
wherever you need those network

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,210
functions to better manage manage your

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:16,770
traffic and deliver the right quality of

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:19,230
experience so when you think about

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,350
today's network transformation in the

00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,210
beginning it is really focused on the

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,970
centralized core the wireless core

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,150
things like virtually PC virtual IMS

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,220
just to name a few however with the

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,470
modernization of fixed networks and

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,720
fixed networks becoming much more fiber

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,880
rich the attention of the industry has

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,729
now shifted towards the edge of the

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,090
network and a concept called next

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,970
generation Co now in this vision each

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:51,840
central office must be able to support

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,790
both fixed and mobile communications it

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,840
also must be able to support a plethora

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,380
of do

00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,680
vises data and a ton of new subscribers

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:04,110
and with this calm source riders are

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,360
beginning to see their central office as

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,540
a strategic point in their network to

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,840
deliver all sorts of new experiences 5g

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,480
use cases IOT use cases immersive media

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,070
and entertainment and if you think about

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,750
immersive media just for a second you

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,100
think about the underlying

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,320
characteristics it requires very high

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,060
bandwidth as well as a low latency

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,940
network and then you think about a

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,950
typical CEO today typical CEOs don't

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,660
have the right computes storage or

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,880
flexibility to be able to deal with that

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,070
workload in an efficient manner and

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,720
still deliver the right quality of

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,070
experience so this portion of the

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,930
network is truly right for

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,150
transformation and it will set us up

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,550
very well by enabling us to have the

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:48,630
right speed and nibble illness in the 5g

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:52,500
error so you can think about this ng CEO

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,960
as really a fiber rich mini data center

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,780
that could support up to thirty five

00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,420
thousand subscribers as compared to a

00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,480
typical CEO today which is roughly five

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,670
thousand subscribers in addition to this

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,690
it's located between the access network

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:12,480
and the Metro transport network and

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:15,000
essentially it is a scaled-down version

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,580
of a data center in a smaller area in

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,110
smaller footprint but it still delivers

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,970
them right amount of computes and

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,040
flexibility needed to handle those

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,620
unique cases that service providers are

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,660
suspected to deal with now we are seeing

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,370
lots of lots of innovations across

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,370
different industry standard groups and

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,920
open source groups alike we're seeing a

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,750
lot of effort in terms of putting new

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,990
innovations into reference architectures

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,540
to enable vns and new applications or

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,850
services is truly scale at this location

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,940
edge and because of this we're seeing a

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,620
lot of comm service friars truly I this

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,110
portion of the network and look to

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,540
innovate really around the globe and in

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,060
all sorts of circumstances from urban

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,840
dense environments to suburban

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:03,390
landscapes to even rule cos and with

00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,580
this Intel is definitely doing our share

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,190
we are working on optimizing their

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,589
critical workloads such as VB and

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,889
and virtually PC here and in fact

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:16,500
through the use of DP DK we were able to

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:19,259
achieve roughly 4 gigabits per second on

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,839
a commercial off-the-shelf server more

00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:24,180
than enough to handle these workloads of

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,399
today in addition to this we've also

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,930
showcased with partners how you can

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,819
through an automated network

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,189
infrastructure dynamically scale the

00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:33,899
compute resources up and down in order

00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:36,269
to ensure you're better managing your

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:40,350
traffic as well as better managing your

00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:42,000
overall TCL it's these sorts of

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,250
innovations and these sorts of

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,319
partnerships that's truly critical to

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:51,269
drive network transformation and scale

00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:55,310
our networks so now let's turn our

00:11:51,269 --> 00:12:00,029
attention to the RAM and unlike previous

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:02,240
generations of wireless 5g caters and

00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,560
provides the right tools to deliver

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,379
vertical specific applications or

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,420
enterprise applications furthermore it

00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,879
provides calm service riders the ability

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:15,029
to solve these problems with the right

00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,779
amount of resources not too much or not

00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,370
too little

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,819
kind of like the Goldilocks principle

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,259
and one of the use cases you've probably

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:24,930
heard about is something called a

00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:27,899
virtual rant and a virtual ran is simply

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:30,180
put it is a general-purpose server that

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,550
can run all baseband functions and this

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,839
server would be located at a different

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:38,850
spot than the remote radio head and if

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,670
you think about some of the cloud

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,839
service provider business models and

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,699
I'll call service providers sometimes

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,370
look at that flexibility those computes

00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:49,519
you can see how virtual ran would be a

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,870
great fit essentially it's a composable

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,970
architecture that you could use for all

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,490
sorts of deployment scenarios in

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,680
addition to this it can be a very good

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,209
asset for app developers as app

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,579
developers truly look to drive

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:05,639
innovations in smart retail smart

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:07,589
manufacturing and smart transportation

00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,839
they could take advantage of the rands

00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,569
proximity to users and it's real-time

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,059
nature and use things such as real-time

00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:19,019
fine-grain analytics to bring out the

00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:21,089
best in those use cases for example with

00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,050
our Intel flex ran reference

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,230
architecture we

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,269
recently had good partnerships on - or

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,040
distributor radio systems these

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:30,870
locations to not only provide

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,230
connectivity but also can provide

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,300
computes again back at the Korean

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,940
Olympics Intel with a partner utilize

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,519
the flex ran capability plus MEC and

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,430
allowed people that were attending the

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,740
Olympics to virtually walk onto the Ice

00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:50,339
Arena providing a whole new experience

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,260
for those users in addition to this

00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,660
we've also partnered with telephonic and

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,670
five tonic showcasing how you can use

00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,329
flex ran and allowing five tonic

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:04,380
customers to demo ran experiences that

00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:05,760
they expect to happen in the 5g era now

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,779
we are certainly seeing a ton of

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,269
traction in the ran around

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,959
virtualization and we've got to see more

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:14,700
in the 5g era and we also do expect

00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,230
traditional integrated base stations and

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:22,860
continue to flourish and really

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:25,649
complement virtual ran in 5g so the

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,450
network of the future does need to does

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,520
need to deliver both customization and

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,079
personalization and one of the key

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,880
technologies that truly pull this

00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,790
together something called Network

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,529
slicing now what network slicing does is

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,200
that it simply allows you to create a

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,610
slice of the network for a specific

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,640
vertical market application and hit

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,950
those underlying KPIs and SLA at the

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,740
same time you run that on top of a

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:52,410
horizontal network so you can still meet

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,570
your TCO where I hit while hitting the

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,100
overall quality of experience you can

00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,380
see how this could be a critical

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,089
technology in the era of 5g where you

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,300
have a lot of different diverse use

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:05,399
cases such as IOT with low bandwidth as

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,160
well as low latency in many cases where

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,470
as a our VR or cloud gaming may have

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,600
high bandwidth and low latency we are

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,180
such believers in this technology that

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,730
re innovating ourselves in our Oregon 5g

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,470
lab currently by type of service by type

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,540
of radio and we're working towards

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,790
dynamic slicing all of which will be

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:30,089
given back to onap is part of our open

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:32,399
source efforts now Intel does continue

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,920
to invest in a whole set of new

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,939
platforms and just in the last 12 months

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,039
we've innovated and we

00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:41,909
livered are zeon scalable processor

00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:44,519
family RZ on d and our atom c 3000 all

00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:46,789
with delivering a top-to-bottom scalable

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,079
roadmap with strong architecture

00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:50,639
consistency this is along with the

00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,509
additional ingredients we have such as

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,639
FPGAs SSDs and ethernet to complete that

00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:58,739
edge vision and the beauty of this

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,929
roadmap is the architecture consistency

00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:03,659
if you think about it an essential core

00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:05,129
network you may want max performance to

00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,889
be able to hit the bandwidth you'd

00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:10,439
select a xeon SP in other cases you may

00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:12,419
need a solution that caters to more

00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:15,389
power and space constrained environment

00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:17,249
and in that case you may select xeon d

00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:20,129
the beauty is with architecture

00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:22,529
consistency you could truly scale your

00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:24,809
vns as well as your applications

00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,909
throughout your network with great ease

00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:28,769
and be able to deliver the sort of

00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:33,869
network that will truly allow you to hit

00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:37,019
your customers expectations and with

00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:40,289
that I'm really excited to announce or

00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,389
to invite Melissa eavers hood to the

00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:45,029
stage she is our senior director of

00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,739
cloud and edge open source software at

00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:49,199
Intel and she would like to share with

00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:51,029
you some latest innovations welcome

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,299
Melissa thank you Dan it's great to be

00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:53,299
here

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,750
I am thrilled to be here to announce a

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:07,920
couple really exciting things that we

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:11,170
have going on specifically we intend to

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,600
contribute some very substantial assets

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,880
into the open source ecosystem with the

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,880
explicit intent of accelerating edge

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,180
technology and innovation specifically

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,150
we are intending to open source our Wind

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,370
River titanium cloud for those of you

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,650
who know Wind River titanium cloud it

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:33,090
has a stellar reputation in the industry

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:36,280
and is in production today with

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,640
deployments from IOT and industrial edge

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,500
all the way up to carrier grade

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,200
implementations of edge technology this

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,030
is intended to really accelerate the

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,820
ecosystem with regard to providing

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,460
assets that are low latency provide high

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,640
availability the ability to update in

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,950
the field etc in addition we are also

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,610
open sourcing our network edge

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:04,660
virtualization SDK this set of libraries

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:07,900
and api's enable developers to develop

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,790
applications for edge use cases without

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,610
having to understand the complexities of

00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,430
various network protocols these two

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,020
assets are tremendously valuable to our

00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,150
company and we hope they will be

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,800
tremendously valuable to the ecosystem

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,380
as well we believe that they will

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,540
provide the foundation to coalesce and

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,290
really get that flywheel goal going that

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:31,000
Jim spoke about earlier in addition I

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,210
wanted to announce that we are

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,450
contributing these projects under the ik

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,760
Reynaud project so we feel that there

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,770
needs to be one edge stack there's a lot

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,810
of projects across the ecosystem and an

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,170
open source that are dabbling with

00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,970
trying to create an edge stack that is

00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,260
hardened and reliable and ready for

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,900
production

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,880
we are announcing with this host of

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,770
amazing partners that were standing up

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,750
and joining a crane Oh with the

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,540
intention of making this project the

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,940
project for edge specifically with

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,640
regard to Intel's contributions the Wind

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,330
River titanium cloud has over seven new

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,240
assets that will be contributed to the

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,070
we will also we also have a huge host of

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,070
patches that add features and

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:20,040
capabilities to existing upstream open

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,800
source projects so the likes of CEFCU

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,440
emu OpenStack etc and so we will be

00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,630
working very aggressively in the

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,690
communities that these projects are in

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,550
to try to merge these patches upstream

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,110
and give the entire community the

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,770
benefit of this innovation and

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,930
engineering we are very excited about

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,690
what this represents for the company but

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:45,360
we recognize that it we need all of your

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,600
support all of us need to work together

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,700
to contribute to not only stabilizing an

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,590
edge stack for deployment across the

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,490
variety of use cases that exist today

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:58,590
from industrial to to carrier but also

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,740
what's coming in our future we all see

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:04,200
the dreams and the realities that are

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,300
possible with 5g and we recognize that

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,220
while these assets are tremendous and

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,650
they should very much accelerate the

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,360
innovation fly cycle in the same regard

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,330
we know that we have more work to do

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,000
we have to be very focused on trying to

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,920
figure out the containerization and

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,200
future technologies and we need your

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,990
support not only in the communities but

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,580
also innovating to lead this platform

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,580
forward thank you

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,100
thanks to tongue Melissa was truly

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,950
exciting to hear about the crema project

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,380
as well as Intel's contributions I do

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,559
see that as a big part of the overall

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:49,039
industry effort to enable edge

00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:50,870
applications in the future so Intel's

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,600
relationship with the Linux Foundation

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,490
we believe is truly essential it's truly

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,190
essential to drive the right reference

00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,070
architectures and innovation so we can

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,500
truly scale our networks in the future

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,750
and as platform members were quite proud

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,010
of our contributions we're quite proud

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,230
that we partner with the overall

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,960
industry on a wide variety of projects

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:16,070
ranging from opendaylight Opie Anna V DB

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,950
DK Fido own app just to mention a few

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:21,649
and most of our contributions truly

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,809
center around bringing out the best in

00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:26,809
the hardware platforms in a very open

00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:29,539
way creating the right interfaces on top

00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:32,270
so everyone can can innovate in a true

00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:34,789
open fashion so because of this we

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:37,220
typically do contribute to projects such

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:39,309
as DB DK and Fido but in addition to

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,409
this we also do contribute and support

00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:44,690
many efforts at the orchestration and

00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:47,539
controller level as we do see these as

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,370
vital assets to truly enable the

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,789
flexibility we've been talking about in

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,289
this very discussion now additionally we

00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,659
also have something called the Intel

00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:58,850
Network builders now this is a vibrant

00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:02,450
community that truly pulls together

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:05,029
across is V's OS vs IH V's and comm

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,190
service fires to pull together network

00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:10,159
transformation solutions that are been

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:13,190
optimized tested and then soon to be

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,760
deployed we are quite proud with over

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:20,990
260 members today and there's over 82

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,659
unique solutions this is truly an

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,730
exciting time it's truly a great time to

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:27,590
be part of this networking community I

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,240
look forward to continuing to partner

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,130
with everyone in this room and I look

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,350
forward to sharing a few moments with

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,380
everyone perhaps in the hallway or other

00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,140
elephant events during the week thank

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:44,260
you very much for your time

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:44,260
