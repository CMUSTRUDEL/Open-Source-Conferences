hi there everybody ooh loud I realized

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,630
I'm between break so what I'm going to

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,269
do is I'm going to talk quickly through

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,190
my slides and leave some time for

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,279
questions kind of wake you back up

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,900
before you go out and wreak a phonate

00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,740
one of the things though from sitting

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,660
behind the magic curtain here is as

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,010
Justin got up and start talking about

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,720
ubers evolution into Open Networking the

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,880
amount of excitement and downright

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,790
giddiness sitting around the table

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,340
between Gavin and Arpit about hey we've

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,829
been working on this for a long time and

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,890
look at the look at the position how

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,879
these things came together and how we're

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,110
able to talk about a common set of of

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,530
systems and a common set of mental

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:58,289
models and and really the similarities

00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:01,980
that's because of open networking I also

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,140
just a little side note when Bob got up

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,710
and talked about arm my physics

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,460
background is in generating power from

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,939
temperature gradients so that PhD was

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,909
years ago and now arm has IP in it so

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,119
these things really do come we labor and

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,740
you work hard and then you get up on a

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,020
stage and you hear that all of these

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,110
things are actually dropping in and so I

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,450
I have slightly different background

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,880
than our previous speakers I'm actually

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,310
a network consumer so I work really

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,490
closely with the AWS networking team who

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,500
is here so if you have deep networking

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,970
questions go talk to them alright

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,149
there's some hands wave apparently

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,409
they're sitting over there but I'm going

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,750
to talk to you a little bit about what

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,590
IOT needs from the network and what IOT

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,840
provides into the network just for those

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,869
who haven't spent day in and day out in

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,200
the IOT space it's here it's been here

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:04,860
for a while this is one week of customer

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,170
meetings for me so yes that's facial

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,110
recognition on pigs to figure out

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,129
exactly when to feed when to vaccinate

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,540
who to breed these are important things

00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,700
Manufacturing automotive manufacturing

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,280
we've got shipping containers with

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,189
perishables one of those containers full

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,650
of crab meat is worth $750,000 you want

00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:29,889
to know whether it was spoiled before it

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:33,790
went in or not we've got last mile

00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:36,939
delivery with drones so cool and then of

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,790
course flow through airports turns out

00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:42,609
you can basically pay for a smart

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,919
lighting infrastructure just by solving

00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:48,219
the problem of where are the wheelchairs

00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:51,159
in an airport right coolest job ever

00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:54,129
like super cool I get to learn about all

00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:57,819
these things but one of the downsides of

00:02:54,129 --> 00:03:01,959
using wonderful acronyms like IOT or not

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:06,010
I thought I was clever is that you

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,620
forget what the underlying meaning of

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,480
the actual name is so we hear all the

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,250
time about IOT but we don't always talk

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,129
about the Internet of Things anymore

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:19,720
with customers or if we do we talk about

00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:22,180
the things Internet is the operative

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,340
piece there have been things for a very

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,099
long time they just haven't been

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,019
connected in the numbers at the scale

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:38,439
and driving the same value that they are

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:40,349
today so so what well the internet

00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:44,620
although originally designed by

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:48,009
physicists to talk and communicate with

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,780
each other really developed into with

00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:54,790
love the web technologies a very

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,509
extensive powerful content delivery

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,549
network how do we get content out to the

00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:02,979
masses of endpoints that want to be able

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,379
to consume that and by all means there's

00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,900
data come in the other direction too but

00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:11,019
if you look at the way that most of the

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,789
peering relationships are built if you

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,579
look at the way the mapping and the

00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:17,680
management of traffic flow is built it's

00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:22,360
really built to deliver in cash at the

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,300
edge I owe t reverses that all of a

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,930
sudden you've got potentially 130,000

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,800
cents

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:32,500
sitting on an oil refinery sending data

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,180
to some central vibration sensor

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,310
management system that's doing

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,430
predictive analytics on every compressor

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,320
within that refinery that's a lot of

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,320
data moving in the other direction

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,449
that's caused some challenges as

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,820
companies think through how do i how do

00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:55,930
I address I still have you know all of

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,449
my content delivery to do where AWS

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,690
where Amazon we do a lot of that but now

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:04,110
I also need to look at load balancing in

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,110
the other direction

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,690
the mobility networks IOT is a blessing

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,610
and a curse first machine the machine

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,990
looked like the best thing ever

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:22,300
I can resell my 2g 3G networks they're

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:27,220
brand new again that's like you know

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:29,889
free money floating underneath then came

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,139
those pesky little startups with their

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:35,139
LP one and their low run there

00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:38,680
well gotta figure out how we answer that

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:42,310
so that LTE oh we've got env IOT C

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:47,229
acronyms narrowband IOT all of that has

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:50,710
created this shouting match a little bit

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,349
within the IOT space for I can deliver

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:58,330
your data faster better cheaper and

00:05:53,349 --> 00:06:00,810
securely there's been a lot of naysaying

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,009
over who does what when where and how

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,880
but they're a couple fundamental pieces

00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:09,280
about in about IOT one there are a lot

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,190
of global companies who have assets in

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,780
the middle of nowhere so it's not

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,669
typically where cellular networks have

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,870
had their strongest backgrounds

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,780
populations all of us with our mobile

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:27,090
phones that tends to make for a better

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:29,680
network for a more productive network

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,830
now that's changing a little bit will we

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,830
get 5g with a different with a different

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,320
map maybe you still have to use the same

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:42,550
infrastructure

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,790
but again IOT kind of the little thorn

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,050
but with big promise 50 billion devices

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:54,040
who doesn't want that sitting on the

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:55,840
network and then finally corporate

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,400
networks get ahold of mobile devices

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,340
they finally figured out they've got

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,540
their MDM solutions they figured out the

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:08,020
security paradigms and along comes the

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,120
corporate fitness tracker right HR loves

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,330
it they get to learn they get to reduce

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,330
their costs potentially within our

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,640
insurance but now there's a whole nother

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:23,640
group of devices that don't play by the

00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:27,310
same rules don't have the homogeneity of

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,580
application infrastructure of operating

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,700
systems it's a whole new world that has

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,510
to be kind of shoehorned into the MDM

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,550
world if you're in the industrial space

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,330
which even most of the consumer electric

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,850
companies who build their own are you're

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,770
also trying to figure out how do i how

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,170
do i deal with air gap networks it used

00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,560
to be that I could mote off all of my

00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:59,890
critical infrastructure and that was my

00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:02,220
security and then Stuxnet and everyone

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:05,380
sort of what ooh maybe I need to motes

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:10,900
okay well that doesn't work when to take

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:12,790
advantage of all of the IOT connected $5

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,690
sensors right behind the mote you get

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:18,760
the $50,000 vibration sensor if you

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,240
build the bridge over that moat you can

00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,110
spend five dollars and you get better

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,540
data density

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,500
did you put more five-dollar sensors on

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,210
than 150-thousand one so we've seen a

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,740
lot of customers struggling with how do

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,990
I take my corporate network and then how

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,419
do I figure out how to connect that to

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,660
the devices and then where I don't have

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,430
where I'm using cloud services because I

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,200
don't have the toolbox I don't have the

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,590
flexibility of toolbox I also don't want

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,320
my engineers you know figuring out how

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,820
to optimize the underpinnings of ml

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,130
models I want

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,690
Amazon to handle that so that my guys

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,250
are focused on actually building those

00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,080
models and running those models and want

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:03,670
them to LA delivering the actual value

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,560
not the infrastructure it's been

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,450
interesting let's just say that it's

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,550
been interesting and there's there are a

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:13,450
lot of a lot of requests for how we fix

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:18,790
that the cloud brings all these things

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,870
together again our networking team can

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,400
talk to you a little bit about what

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,260
we're doing in that area but IOT for AWS

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,270
and everyone else has redefined what

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,670
edge is yes there's the edge to the

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:34,660
network funniest thing in the world is

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,790
to be in a naming meeting where the

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,650
debate about what is the edge happens

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,910
and you've got people who've been in

00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,110
cloud for years and they're talking

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,340
about you know the edge of the network

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,200
and they're talking about the edge of

00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,720
the cloud and then you got oh but I

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,580
don't know how T I mean the Gateway is

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
the edge or you got the endpoint you got

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:55,060
the earth your sensor device but you

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,670
know so AWS greengrass was a nice

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,840
compromise that's our edge product we

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,570
didn't have to get too fancy with the

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,020
name in there but all of this really

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,780
moves from a management structure from a

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,050
flexibility and capacity structure from

00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,600
a consistency of tooling and

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,120
transparency and visibility really

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:25,210
changes the way that we as a cloud

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:27,120
company experience Network so how is IOT

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,760
helped to solve some of these problems

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,920
IOT isn't just a problem we help solve a

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,100
few things too and we work very closely

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,950
with our networking teams within the IOT

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:44,950
service delivery teams on a couple of

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:46,440
key areas one is just again based on the

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,300
heterogeneity of IOT devices

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,190
over-the-air updates have had to become

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,380
something that that we got really good

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,900
at that we understand how to do in an

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,640
intelligent manner that's one of those

00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,350
technology stacks that we've been

00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,790
working with our networking guys to

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,090
figure out how can we leverage what

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,190
we've built in the IOT space

00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,370
so that the networking team doesn't have

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,810
to maintain a whole separate stack

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,740
remote device management kind of falls

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,840
into that as well again being able to

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,640
leverage that underpinnings of what

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,430
we've done in the IOT space that we've

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,210
been able to turn into kind of a crank

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:28,920
the handle type service time series

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:31,470
analysis I ran into one of my neighbors

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,060
he's like hey I used your new your new

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,600
IOT analytic service I'm like oh that's

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,820
awesome

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,730
what are you doing with it well I'm in

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,290
the networking team so turns out you

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,110
guys pull together a lot of the

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:46,230
components that that we needed from time

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:50,010
series to data ingest and pipeline

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:52,800
preparation to being able to set up

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,420
scheduled queries having sort of a

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,180
one-stop shop to pull all of that

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,970
together into a dashboard that's fairly

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:04,080
simple and automatically updates for

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:08,750
daily and weekly meetings like ha ha ha

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,710
look at that network is full of devices

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,750
I'm gonna talk a little bit more about

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,280
security on the next slide but security

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:19,130
is another one of these kind of two-way

00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:23,760
streets security is both top concern

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:27,870
with in IOT customers and also something

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,460
that AWS takes is our top priority so

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,740
it's something where we've really seen a

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,910
lot of give and take where IOT is is a

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,660
canary in the coalmine

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:42,210
for certain types of landscapes and

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:44,930
where i OT can also leverage and benefit

00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,730
from network security and frankly

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,280
particularly the metadata within the

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,840
network IOT does not necessarily carry

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:58,760
context with it so you get a workload in

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:03,560
fact a little scenario here we've got

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:06,620
nuclear power plant 130,000 sensors

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,620
let's say 75,000 of them start going off

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,990
do we have a DDoS attack do we have a

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,420
spoof system or are we in the situation

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,330
where we actually have a meltdown

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,330
there's really no way from the message

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,100
structures to tell the difference so we

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,790
need to be able to have the context

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,700
around what that use case is and the

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,380
network is what helps give us that it

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,390
helps look at the behavioral patterns

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,540
and it helps us to determine whether

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:39,900
this is in fact legitimate traffic so

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,450
working very closely on on being able to

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:46,260
build that context really starting at

00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:51,840
the network itself we've heard a lot

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:55,320
about interoperability bill talked about

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,880
information modelling actually so did

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,450
justin he mentioned that was a problem

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,830
this is one of those areas where we and

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:08,400
IOT have not fixed it and are hoping

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,840
that you're going to lead the way and we

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,840
work very closely on trying to figure

00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,490
out what is the standardization around

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,870
modeling in structures and how do we how

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,270
do we take advantage of what's gone

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:22,460
before because again when you have the

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,300
types of function virtualized a function

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,510
variety that comes with that

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:30,180
heterogeneity you know find fish is not

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:34,050
a common function but it is a function

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,360
that exists on IOT devices how do we

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,210
leverage what's gone before how do we

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,970
understand how do we use things like own

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,940
app how do we understand what that means

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,350
from an IOT standpoint are there mental

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,880
models we should be adapting or is there

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,980
actually technology that we can

00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,320
underline and adapt especially when

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,840
you're combining you know the function

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,500
virtualization with orchestration those

00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,450
are two key areas where networking has

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,310
gone before and where we are kind of

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,640
catching up in the IOT space and seeing

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:10,310
what is extensible and where we can help

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:14,630
push it this last one kind of key to

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:17,100
open standards open source open exchange

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:21,540
AWS is working harder and harder in this

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,140
area we do a lot we don't always talk

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,040
about it

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,720
we're trying to get a little bit better

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,029
about that too but in the IOT space

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,490
that heterogeneity can be a killer

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:35,089
unless we figure out what pieces of it

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,670
are really standard components that we

00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:40,610
need to open up and communicate and how

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,740
do we how do we deliver value out of

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,350
that how do we validate that value

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,600
across the the supply chain within the

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,120
IOT space it's something that networking

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,339
has not 100% figured out but is it

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,399
better is doing much better than we are

00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:59,089
so I talked fast but not quite fast

00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:01,220
enough we still have four to five

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:09,790
minutes for questions if anyone has

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:12,290
questions or not maybe we've got break

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,819
all right well I will let you guys go I

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,560
won't ask you questions that was going

00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:17,589
to be the next thing but given that

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,540
we're already running a little bit over

00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:22,579
if you do want to talk to the AWS

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,560
networking team they are here they are

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,420
the team that builds the networks within

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,480
AWS or they're an infrastructure team

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:35,920
versus a software services team and

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,920
