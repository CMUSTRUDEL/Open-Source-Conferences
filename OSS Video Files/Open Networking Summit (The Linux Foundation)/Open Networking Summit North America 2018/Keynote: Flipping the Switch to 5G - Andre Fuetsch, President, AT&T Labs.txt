well thank you our pet and good

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:09,469
afternoon it's really great to be here

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,900
especially in sunny warm California

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:14,730
right here in Los Angeles and it's

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,330
really great because I think the future

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,119
of open networking is really sunny and

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,400
bright and it's exciting to be here with

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,180
you today so I'm going to be a little

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,980
bit less adventurous than Arpit I'm not

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,750
going to do a demo or anything I'm not

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,390
even going to have slides for you I'm

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:39,149
just going to talk about what we're

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,100
doing at AT&T about 5g and also a recent

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,730
announcement we just made the last

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,430
couple days about some pretty amazing

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,329
new things that we're doing that really

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,930
to prove the power of disaggregation and

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:58,949
open and so ons has always been a

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,210
pivotal moment each year for AT&T you

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,820
know for the last several years

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,729
ons has always been the mark of new

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,369
milestones for us on this journey to

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,600
disaggregation and opening of our

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:16,020
networks and now with the 5g era upon us

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,810
and all this new connected applications

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,600
that will come with it this whole

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,479
mission of is more critical ever than

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,900
before and we have a really great plan

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,290
for 5g and I hope you'll find it just as

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,850
exciting as I do so let me tell you a

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,829
little bit about the background of that

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,200
let me walk you through how far we've

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,299
come over the last few years with OH&S

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,610
at the center of this and this is really

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,979
important if we rewind back to 2014 at

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,579
ons when we were back up in Northern

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:57,619
California we we laid out a vision for a

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:03,210
virtualized and software-defined network

00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:05,670
the next year in 2015 at ons we outlined

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,700
how we were bringing virtualization to

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,270
bear on what became AT&T fiber and that

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,890
was with our jeep on Oh LTS and we

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,360
explained how open source

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,209
was at the center of our overall network

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,390
transformation strategy since then we

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:28,650
have broadened and accelerated our work

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:31,650
with onf OCP own app and the whole Linux

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,980
Foundation family and today we are in a

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,320
position to turn the vision of open

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,770
wireline and wireless access platforms

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:45,090
into reality

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:47,730
then in 2016 at ons we unveiled ecomp

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,340
and we asked the developer community for

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,280
feedback if we should really release

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,980
this into open source and the feedback

00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,090
was overwhelmingly positive it was

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:04,019
tremendous now today ecomp is a

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,480
foundational pillar of onap which has

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:10,140
been adopted by mobile operators

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,120
representing over 60% of global mobile

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,730
subscribers and that's pretty phenomenal

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,830
and that's happened really a testament

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,650
to the great work of the Linux

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,799
Foundation and our pet and team of

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,720
really pushing of getting the onap

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,840
vision out there and we're seeing just

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,579
tremendous progress there and we see

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,450
just the beginning it's really just the

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:38,250
beginning of a whole new frontier and

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,799
then at last year at ons 2017 we

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,570
announced our first live trial of a

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,220
white box which carrying customer

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,970
traffic and this is really a big first

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,420
for us at AT&T so why are we pushing so

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,340
hard on this path because the critical

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,910
role in accelerating demands of our

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,310
networks really require this every year

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,100
we talk about this exploding traffic

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:05,090
trends on our wireless network the

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,130
latest is that we're now seeing roughly

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,160
200 petabytes of data across our

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,070
wireless network on a typical business

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,370
day remember last year I gave this stat

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:20,130
it was about 137 petabytes it's almost a

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,610
50% increase just in 12 months

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,349
pretty pretty phenomenal and you know we

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,190
kind of stopped doing the math on how

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,230
many libraries of Congress

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,780
actually equals just because the numbers

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,230
were just getting too ridiculous but we

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,020
don't see any end here in sight at least

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,970
in the near term and we all have a

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,740
pretty good idea of where this new

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:47,110
demands are coming from right

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:49,150
streaming video AR vr gaming we all know

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:53,230
it's about more and more Network demand

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:56,740
and that demand is only gonna accelerate

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:59,380
as 5g comes online we've said we'll

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,140
launch our mobile 5g network in a dozen

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,300
cities before the end of this year the

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,090
first u.s. carrier to do so and we're

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,230
pretty proud of this so just like we

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,360
were first with smartphones back in 2007

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:17,620
ATT will be at the forefront of the next

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,600
evolution of wireless data demand and if

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,110
we're gonna be first we're gonna have to

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,270
be ready so last year I gave you a brief

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,610
overview of one way we're looking to

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,190
meet that demand which was by testing

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,510
white box routers switches and other

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:37,270
equipment running open software the goal

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,669
was to see if there was a way to rethink

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,060
the model of how we build and manage

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:45,730
access networks the trial is a great

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,580
success though we weren't yet sure if it

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,210
could be scaled for full production well

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,400
we've learned a lot over the last year

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,190
and on today I'm excited to tell you

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,800
that we are ready to move forward with

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,540
taking white box into our mobile packet

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:08,260
network in the latter part of this year

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:13,000
we'll be ramping up into 2019 and beyond

00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:15,280
we plan to deploy over 60,000 white box

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,640
routers in our macro and small cell

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,540
mobile infrastructure these machines

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,750
will be at the core of our 5g build this

00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,970
will be an open hardware design we will

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,280
make these specs available to the

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,700
community later this year so anyone can

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,500
build this hardware we already have a

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,380
handful of these boxes carrying live

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,060
customer traffic today soon we'll have a

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,790
lot more this year will be a trend

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,940
that will take place over a few years

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:51,260
but we think it's the future it's

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:54,080
flexible scalable upgradable and very

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:58,070
very cost-effective but that's not all

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,260
as important as the hardware is we all

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,780
know that the software is the future of

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,210
our network and not the closed

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,419
proprietary systems we've all been stuck

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:11,360
with over the years we need a much more

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:13,550
open and collaborative development model

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,720
and we think we've got just the right

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,340
thing on these white box machines we are

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,370
going to be running software that we

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,710
created we call it the disaggregated

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,360
network operating system you who are pit

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,669
talk about it there's been some

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,000
announcements already we call it day

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:34,520
knows we're not very creative with our

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,660
naming right if you're our new jersey'

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,479
team we call it the nas but danos is

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,860
really we think going to be

00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:48,350
revolutionary for providers immediately

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,390
we think that this model is so exciting

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:54,650
we think there's an opportunity for

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:59,419
service providers at all scales to adopt

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:02,110
it because we're not just using danís

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:04,490
we're releasing it into open source

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,500
we're working with the Lenox foundation

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,720
to turn this into an open project as you

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,210
heard and we expect to see the first

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,690
public code available in the second half

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,270
of this year this is really exciting

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,400
this is a huge milestone for us not just

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,990
an open hardware reference design we'll

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,700
put out there but we're also going to

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,560
put that software out there as well this

00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,880
is not just a network operating system

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,120
that handles the needs of the data

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,469
center this nice handles carrier-grade

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,599
protocols alarms automation and

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,209
operational needs of any scale

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:46,279
communication service provider large or

00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:48,860
small now we've had some great help from

00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,740
many I'm going to call out the Open

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,570
Networking Foundation and many others we

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,930
also got a boost from the technology and

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,649
expertise we acquired

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:01,380
we bought the viata platform last year a

00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:03,570
really amazing and a talented team that

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,710
we're happy to be part of the ATT family

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:10,589
we now have a cutting-edge platform that

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:14,459
can adapt and grow and help all of you

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,750
the open source community now I want to

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,570
take a step back and make sure you

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,940
understand the overall framework we're

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,450
creating and sharing with the open

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:27,209
source community because we're not aware

00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:33,270
of any other operator out there that's

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:36,380
doing as much at this scale dana's is a

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:40,080
big part of it but it's more than that

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,540
we were major contributors to onap the

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,279
open network automation platform which

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,040
was announced that again last year's

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,709
conference onap is a comprehensive

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,520
framework for real-time policy driven

00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:56,190
software automation for virtual network

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,640
functions think of it as an operating

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,650
system for the entire network danis is

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,480
the operating system for the individual

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:07,890
white box machines that make up the

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,650
network and there are other two other

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:14,790
major software platforms we've recently

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:17,820
announced a queue MOS rai platform for

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,700
making AI apps reusable and easily

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:24,390
accessible to any developer and then

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,490
also we we announced a crane o and this

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,459
is a software stack to improve the state

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:33,209
of edge cloud infrastructures for

00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:38,459
carrier providers and IOT networks all

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:40,770
of this is going into open source so

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,170
open source has become such a critical

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:47,040
element of our network transformation

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:51,029
strategy we call all of this that our

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,700
network a I approach network artificial

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:56,899
intelligence you make the network

00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,779
smarter by turning it into software

00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:03,150
injecting AI into it and then opening up

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,750
to the developer community and we think

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,339
this is really really powerful

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:13,020
so this is a really pivotal year for

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:16,370
AT&T and our industry as 5g starts to

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:19,170
redefine what connectivity means and

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,290
network applications will look like in

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,029
the future as wireless connection speeds

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,480
start to be measured in hundreds of

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:30,330
megabits and even gigabits per second

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,910
and we see Layton sees begin to drop

00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:36,029
into the single digit millisecond range

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,070
I believe we're going to see a range of

00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:42,570
use cases we can't even imagine right

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:46,830
now whether it's edge computing smart

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:49,110
cities in IOT super high-res streaming

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,230
video or something else entirely new

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:57,149
that we know the world is eager to see

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:59,550
what 5g can do and frankly all we can do

00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:02,390
is make sure we have networks that are

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,459
adaptable that are ready for whatever

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:09,890
developers businesses or consumers want

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:13,529
to throw at it white box hardware

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:17,010
powered by open source software is

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:18,450
really how we make this happen we're

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,760
excited to get started on this

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,700
transition and I'm really delighted I

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,070
got to share this news with you today I

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,260
want to first of all thank you for

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:31,170
everything you're doing on this amazing

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,600
journey with us I hope you enjoy the

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,399
rest of the conference and I'll be

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,700
around later this evening if you've got

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:41,300
questions and again thank you for all

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:46,550
that you do have a great conference

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,550
