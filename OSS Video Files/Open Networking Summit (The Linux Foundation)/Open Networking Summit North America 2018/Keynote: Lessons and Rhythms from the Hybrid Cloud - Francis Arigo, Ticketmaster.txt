	Keynote: Lessons and Rhythms from the Hybrid Cloud - Francis Arigo, Principal Architect, Ticketmaster

Many large enterprises have chosen to integrate public cloud providers while still maintaining their private cloud infrastructure; the hybrid cloud. Some see the hybrid approach as "the best of both worlds", while others use hybrid as an intermediate step to the public cloud. However, going hybrid comes with its own set of complications. In this Keynote, Francis Arigo will use music to share Ticketmaster's journey that led to them choosing the hybrid cloud strategy and the some of the real-world challenges that decision brings.
