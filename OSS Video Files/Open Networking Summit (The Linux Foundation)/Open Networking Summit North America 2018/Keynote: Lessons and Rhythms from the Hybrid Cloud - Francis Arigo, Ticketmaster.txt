Description: 
	Keynote: Lessons and Rhythms from the Hybrid Cloud - Francis Arigo, Principal Architect, Ticketmaster

Many large enterprises have chosen to integrate public cloud providers while still maintaining their private cloud infrastructure; the hybrid cloud. Some see the hybrid approach as "the best of both worlds", while others use hybrid as an intermediate step to the public cloud. However, going hybrid comes with its own set of complications. In this Keynote, Francis Arigo will use music to share Ticketmaster's journey that led to them choosing the hybrid cloud strategy and the some of the real-world challenges that decision brings.

Aloha oh we got responses excellent not

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:18,740
everyone else to do that we'll see if we

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:21,539
can hook in here they're good anyway

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,269
we'll start out hi I'm Francis Arrigo I

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,939
run the network team over a Ticketmaster

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:31,260
and I've already jumped sorry

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,210
one two I'll see if we can do this I run

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,550
the network team at Ticketmaster we run

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,469
a hybrid cloud at Ticketmaster ARPA

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,059
thought that would be a good story to

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:45,030
tell of our journey to a hybrid cloud

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:47,070
some of the decisions that or the the

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,370
thinking that went into the decisions to

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,899
go hybrid cloud and some of the lessons

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,170
that we learned along the way from a

00:00:51,899 --> 00:01:00,059
network perspective but first why do I

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,969
have a guitar right I like to begin with

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,769
an observation that I've had about

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:07,799
networking and music so I've been a

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,090
network engineer all my career and one

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,070
of the things I've noticed that's

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,610
curious is how many network engineers

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,650
are also musicians right so you're

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,990
probably thinking it to be like oh yeah

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,299
but you never thought like oh yeah

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,540
there's a correlation but it it was

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,490
enough when I went to conferences when I

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,150
had vendor meetings oh you're also a

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,119
musician

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,520
how curious so of course your mind spins

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,869
on this and this is one of the theories

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,340
let's spit out for me so one of the

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,799
first things that we learn in music is

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,200
about music timing right you have your

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,780
whole notes your half notes your quarter

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,880
notes your eighth notes the whole note

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,229
of course takes the whole timing of the

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,869
measure it's like 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 you

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,579
split that in half to get your half note

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:03,780
that's 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and so on and so

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:06,240
forth the quarter note does 1 2 3 4 it

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,910
constantly cuts timing in half or

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,640
doubles it like this now there's a

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,970
concept that we use in networking all

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,700
the time

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:23,080
that has the same structure anyone know

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:25,840
subnet masking right if you split your

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,190
slash 24 you can split it into two / 25

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,270
you take a / 25 you splitted the two /

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:36,160
26 is the reason that network engineers

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,440
are frequently also good me this is

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,160
because we've been subtending all our

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:48,850
lives so what does this look like to you

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:53,340
so this could be for / 27s or 2/20 sixes

00:02:48,850 --> 00:03:01,020
or it could be or could sound like this

00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:02,420
doing here it there we go

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,530
[Music]

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,790
it sounds like Tracy Chapman in this

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:12,090
fast car almost but so this is you got a

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,090
fast cloud I want datacenters anyway

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,340
maybe we can make the deal maybe

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,070
together we can get away from large

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,470
upfront capex spending refreshing gear

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,660
is always a pain somebody's got to take

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:31,680
care of him I'd rather be you if it's

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:34,170
all the same wish we were just coding CI

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,830
CBE deploying so fast I felt like was

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,740
drunk

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:42,690
the pen seats around us but we wrap them

00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:47,700
all in document either a feeling that

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:49,650
have alone could just focus on the

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:57,680
business rules the business rules

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:57,680
business rules and that was

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,520
and that was pretty much the theme song

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,890
at ticketmaster when we started our

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,160
journey to the hybrid cloud they started

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:16,690
with a question can't we just all go to

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,950
the public lab right focus more on

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,070
business rules focus on the business

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,750
rules focus more on speed of delivery

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,390
open the floodgates to public cloud and

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,770
there's also a lot of reasons why

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:34,010
Ticketmaster sits in the public cloud

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:37,150
especially with our traffic profile so

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:43,370
if you're not familiar with Ticketmaster

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:45,250
excuse me we have any water but if

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:55,460
you're not familiar with Ticketmaster

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:56,540
thank you thank you for already yeah if

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,830
you're not familiar with taking master

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:04,160
we sell tickets frequently for concerts

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:07,550
for highly popular artists such as

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Beyonce and what happens is show opener

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,560
concert at 10:00 a.m. on a Friday and at

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,220
10:00 a.m. on a Friday her fans attack

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,160
us right it's not just her fans it's

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,260
bots that are from resellers are trying

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,810
to scoop up tickets so they can resell

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,610
it on their markets and they attack us

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,260
all at the same time for a five to

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,760
30-minute window because that's when

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,580
those seats are available after that

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,590
they're gone so internally to us it

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:38,840
looks like a DDoS now that yeah yeah

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,900
it's it's 20 20 X 250 X depending on the

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,700
artist but that is also a model that

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,490
fits well in the public cloud because of

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,760
its on-demand nature of a public cloud

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,890
you can on-demand spin up resources and

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,550
then after the concerts we can we can

00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,810
give them back and one of the other one

00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,630
of the other things that fit for

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,550
Ticketmaster for public cloud is it gave

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,580
us a forcing function to actually take

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,810
older cloud VM technology and filter it

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,510
and make it into or put make a new stack

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,760
container rise to container eyes to

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,440
increase development speed to

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,720
orchestrate with kubernetes to simplify

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,130
our deployments give all the scalability

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,230
give all the availability and in reality

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:28,670
we did that we did that so we created a

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:30,800
public cloud platform where we're giving

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,440
our developers that that chance to

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,280
increase productivity and one of the

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,540
things that came out of it was

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:42,110
Ticketmaster verified van sorry

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:47,180
the singing took it out of me

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:48,920
verified fan which puts more more more

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,200
tickets into the fans in the hands of

00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,730
fans as opposed to those BOTS and

00:06:51,200 --> 00:07:02,540
scalpers that are were attacking us that

00:06:52,730 --> 00:07:05,840
we're talking out earlier yes sorry but

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:08,360
not all services at in our discovery not

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,480
all services fit well into the public

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,040
cloud the first of which actually there

00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,610
were many services but the first

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,560
category is services and clients that

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,800
needed better than internet levels of

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,620
service what does that mean we all know

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,320
in this in this crowd that Internet is

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,840
best effort right it's best no matter

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,480
how much you make your providers

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,310
redundant regionally redundant you can't

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,910
control the hops between you and your

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,860
client you can't control the client

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,140
provider itself and we all know this

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,230
internally when you go to the airport

00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,300
and you go you're getting to TSA do you

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,130
rely on the app to download your

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,090
boarding pass from from the from the

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,040
from the internet

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,350
no you download into your wallet because

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,280
you don't want to have that stress of it

00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,080
not being available at the time and and

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,570
now and that's true for these public

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:10,310
cloud services that we've been being

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:12,140
creating sorry so this is not acceptable

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,540
for a lot of the services that we have

00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,520
at Ticketmaster what's an example of

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,770
that for example when tens of thousands

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,470
of fans are waiting at the gate outside

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,840
of football stadium to get checked in

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,220
those scanners that validate those

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,950
tickets need to have better than

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,600
internet levels of service

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,280
internet levels of service now there's

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,470
two ways to solve that either you can

00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,020
keep providing a more reliable Network

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,250
to those services or you can react

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,710
attack the client and that's something

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:44,070
that we did with TM presences you can

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:46,650
see this that's the new way to check in

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:50,430
where we replace paper tickets with

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,560
digital passes and by doing that we also

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,570
give ourselves the ability to control

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,530
the client we can retry connectivity and

00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:00,090
it has offline abilities so so that the

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:05,030
internet levels of service isn't isn't

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:08,100
so isn't so bad the other thing that we

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:10,760
we discovered that don't fit in the

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,820
public climate is high-cost workloads

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,520
dense always-on workloads search Kafka

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,570
data mining these are stuff one we went

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,620
to the public cloud with these services

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,180
costed a multitude more than what we

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,430
were spending on Prem and it just wasn't

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:31,740
a good fit so that led us a decision to

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,620
you going hybrid it's kind of the best

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,530
of both worlds right it gives you that

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:40,890
dynamic elasticity we get to still

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,840
maintain those higher SLA services that

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,170
that need better than Internet service

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,730
levels it gives our developers a choice

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,850
of platform developing the plug cloud

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:53,370
develop on Prem we created a an on-prem

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,220
kubernetes cluster so that we can we can

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,510
we had share workloads between the the

00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,810
public and the and the private

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,190
infrastructure but and it seems like

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,450
it's it's the best of both worlds

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,620
however it comes with consequences right

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,700
one of the consequences that we noted

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,680
and again this is more tone to it

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,110
towards the network infrastructure one

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,740
of the consequences that we noted is

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:22,590
security becomes at least twice as more

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,990
complex right so if you think about you

00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,850
do security in in VM container or in

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,860
containers and the VM world traditional

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,320
firewalls but now they all have to sync

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:37,650
up we have to have a unified policy over

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:40,020
all of these these these platforms now

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,980
automation is key in especially in the

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,899
traditional

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,990
traditional networking automating to

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,519
create an SDN like experience over

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,180
traditional firewalls with key in our

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:55,260
case to being provide consistency across

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,510
all the platforms a good security policy

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,060
still allows your developers to deploy

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,399
fast but at the same time putting

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,930
guardrails around security and

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:09,870
compliance one of the other challenges

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:14,850
definitely in hybrid that we backed into

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:16,320
is governance it's the same with

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,949
security now you have doubled the

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,449
complexity to figure out how you monitor

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,399
your assets not monitor your asset but

00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:25,410
to keep track of your assets keep track

00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,750
of roles and responsibilities who's

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,670
who's container is that what service

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,350
does that go to who's responsible for

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,630
that as well as the financial part which

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,459
is who's going to pay for those who's

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,820
what department is in charge of that and

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,800
as we as we take a look at spending and

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,260
who's spending it's important to keep

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,350
those assets in track and who's who's

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,440
rupaul's before that performance and

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,810
measurements monitoring monitoring and

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,569
SLA is becomes a big component in that

00:11:51,810 --> 00:12:01,399
as well the other part that is there's a

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:04,230
challenge for us is when you go hybrid

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,910
the connectivity that you have between

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,260
your public cloud and your private cloud

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:12,120
is either either by Direct Connect or

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,630
VPN it's still when connectivity there

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,750
is some there are some Layton sees

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,699
involved and when you have a hybrid

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,829
cloud it's easier for is for Dell

00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:26,160
developers to think of it as one entity

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:29,310
I'm just deploying it and the problem is

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,720
if you're not when conscious then it

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,730
will introduce Layton sees in your

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,260
application that you weren't aware so if

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,209
you develop a service in the plug cloud

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,040
and you're depending on service back at

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:40,319
the on-prem cloud you have to take those

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,920
into account and you you have to design

00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:47,750
your services to be less dependent on on

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,750
that slower web connection

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:58,970
and so in summary was my timing but in

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,070
summary the week on to the hybrid cloud

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,560
it's a very flexible solution that gives

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,770
us the best of both worlds but it also

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:16,670
comes with complexity and that you have

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:19,160
to take into account thank you Frances

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,750
babbling over that was amazing last

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,300
keynote of the last day actually it was

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,459
surprised to see as many I was hoping

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,050
for less like I don't know that was that

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,260
was really good so thank you thank you

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,610
for doing this thank you for the awesome

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,070
song yeah

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,610
let let I think it'll go viral on

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:40,130
YouTube yeah just stop stop it there

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,540
it representation you okay all right all

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,540
