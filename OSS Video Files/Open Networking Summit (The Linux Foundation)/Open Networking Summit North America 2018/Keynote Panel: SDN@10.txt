About Nick McKeown
Nick McKeown has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Stanford University since 1995. In 2005 he started the Clean Slate Program at Stanford, which with Martin Casado and Scott Shenker led to "Software Defined Networking". He co-founded Nicira (now part of VMware), Abrizio and Nemo ("Network Memory", now part of Cisco), as well as ONF, ON.Lab and P4.org. In 2013 he co-founded Barefoot Networks, where he is Chairman and Chief Scientist. His current passion is to move the network data-plane from fixed-function hardware up and into software where it belongs. He hopes this will foster much faster innovation in networking, and finally hand over the keys to those who own and operate networks, to customize them to best suit their needs.

About Guru Parulkar
Guru Parulkar is a consulting professor of electrical engineering and the executive director of the Open Network Research Center (ONRC) at Stanford University. He is also the executive director and event chair of the Open Networking Summit. From 2007 to 2012, he was the execuitve director of the Clean Slate Internet Design Program at Stanford, whose mission was “to explore what kind of Internet we would design if we were to start with a clean slate and 20-30 years of hindsight.” Clean Slate led to OpenFlow and SDN among other interesting research results.Prior to Clean Slate, Guru was program director at the National Science Foundation and led creation of a few exciting programs including GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovation), FIND (Future Internet Design) and Network of Sensor Systems.

all right welcome everyone that was

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:09,030
great did you enjoy that okay so we're

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,719
gonna switch gears a little bit and talk

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,610
about Sdn at ten and it's it's hard for

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,010
me to believe personally that Sdn is ten

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,770
years old we're gonna take a look at the

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,840
past and the present and where Sdn is

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,800
headed so we have a great panel here and

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,439
I should be a lot of fun so Nick I'm

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,029
gonna start with you and maybe you could

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,790
share with the audience

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,370
how did Sdn get started and where did

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,020
that term you and come from you know you

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,489
got to be careful asking a professor an

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,210
open-ended question like that because I

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,870
could talk for hours but you know it

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,800
when thinking about where Sdn came from

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,510
it's useful to think about what

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,770
networking was like in 2008 if you

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,180
wanted to build a network you had to

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,610
build it from the same equipment that

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,620
everybody else had you had to use the

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,020
same equipment that was provided by all

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,520
the switch and router vendors they were

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,979
closed proprietary vertically-integrated

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,630
the features were baked in from the

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,439
beginning everybody had to deal with the

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,740
same thing network management was a

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:18,330
dirty word if he wanted to manage a

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:22,860
network of switches you had to write

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,470
your own scripts over a lousy cruddy CLI

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,000
and everybody had their own way of doing

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,650
it in order to try and make their

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,840
network different from everybody else's

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,340
and the equipment vendors had no

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,049
incentive to help you to do that because

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,990
they wanted all the intelligence inside

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,759
the box because that's how they could

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,520
extract the most margins from the

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,110
equipment that they were selling this is

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,700
not a cynical view that's actually the

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,950
right business practice for them to do

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,100
but for the Internet this had a

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,149
stagnating effect for anyone trying to

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,450
build a network it made it really hard

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,390
to do what you wanted so the term the

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,090
Internet has ossified came about largely

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,710
from guru and from a few others who were

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,869
pointing out that the network was unable

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,030
to change and so as researchers we

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,649
really wanted to try and figure and this

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,989
started as a research project it was how

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,340
do you introduce change in innovation

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,440
into

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,440
network at Stanford we started a thing

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,470
called the clean slate program and that

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,239
was back in about 2006 2007 and there

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,300
was a PhD student in that group called

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,879
Martine casado and Martine had this idea

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,819
which was hey why don't we rebuild the

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,640
Stanford Network just slightly bold

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,260
thought out of switches and access

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,360
points that we'll build ourselves we're

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,129
going to replace the 2000 switches that

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,739
we had in wiring closets every one of

00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,560
them had a CPU on it so there were 200

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,890
system administrators 2000 CPUs to

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,870
control Stanford's network Martine just

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,230
simply showed that if you lift the

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,440
control up and out of the switches up

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,379
into servers you could replace the 2000

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,420
CPUs with one CPU centrally managed and

00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,480
it would perform exactly how you wanted

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,489
be administered by about 10 people

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,959
instead of 200 and you could implement

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,269
the policies of a large institution

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,099
directly in one place centrally

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,269
administered so we went to talk to a

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,099
bunch of vendors and said hey you this

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,480
seems like a good idea we put all of our

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:19,950
work into the public domain why don't

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,010
you take this idea around with it so

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,090
they got really angry

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,340
they got redder and redder and redder

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,109
and we were like this is really strange

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,910
we seem to have touched a raw nerve here

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:31,980
we got out into the parking lot and said

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,480
ok we better double down on this effort

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,799
so we went back we tripled the size of

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,630
the research program the clean slate

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,639
program was started and then an

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,599
interview a few weeks later cake green

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,579
of MIT Technology Review coined the term

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,690
software-defined networking and in fact

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:51,269
I have the original paper right here so

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,900
there is the paper it was quite ething

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:59,910
right that's right there by marching and

00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:02,340
yourself and second paper open flow that

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:06,000
was authored exactly 10 years ago April

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,910
of 2008 and there's the paper that Nick

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,130
just referred to which is the MIT review

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,780
paper on software-defined networking and

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,569
there you go if you didn't know that

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,139
before that's how the concept of Sdn was

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:21,359
born so quiet

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:25,020
a journey definitely in terms of how

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,449
that came about guru I want to ask you

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,300
I remember reading the paper on open

00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:33,090
flow and it was just mind-blowing when I

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,220
read it it was you know it was new it

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,819
was disruptive it stirred a whole debate

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,129
in the networking industry open flow and

00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,539
architecture that he brought about can

00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,789
you share with the audience what

00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:47,819
inspired you to come up with a concept

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,009
of open flow and you know what what was

00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,770
the you know sort of thinking behind how

00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,150
that came about so I guess how we came

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,220
up with the concept I think lion's share

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,610
of credit really goes to Nick and my

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,639
teen and Scott but in terms of as Nick

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,590
mentioned that in 2006-2007 timeframe

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,500
the research community was feeling as if

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:11,310
that they the internet was ossified and

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,650
their ability to make an impact on

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,800
Internet was very limited they were not

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,389
succeeding in being able to bring about

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,129
new capability the new features and

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,229
functionality to internet it was

00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:23,759
becoming harder and harder and actually

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,590
the research community we had tried out

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,330
different ideas in terms of how we can

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,759
enable and empower the research

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,590
community to do this and then the simple

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,719
idea what seemed like a very simple idea

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,330
to just separate the control plane from

00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:39,469
the forwarding plane define a protocol

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,909
that is open flow and then be able to

00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:43,919
enable research community to build new

00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:47,130
capabilities and functionality on top of

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,520
that control plane kind of came about

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,650
and caught attention of the research

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,770
community and made it very very easy for

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:58,919
the research community to innovate and

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,779
interestingly at the time that number of

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,539
vendors

00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:05,879
agreed to put open flow on their boxes

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:09,840
open flow agents on their boxes so very

00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:12,180
quickly we were able to get switches

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,319
router that were open flow enabled and

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,060
then I Sarah and Stanford created this

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,029
open source controller the first

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,979
generations knocks and beacon and all of

00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,250
that and they were distributed to the

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,319
research community and it really caught

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,909
the imagination of the community and

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,800
then they were able to create lots of

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,259
very interesting capabilities on those

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,430
simple controllers and show that you

00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,650
could

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,389
bring new capabilities there was one

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,699
more idea that came about right after

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:44,010
open flow and that was this idea flow

00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,919
wiser that the idea was that you can

00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:49,169
slice a production network using open

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,110
flow and a simple piece of software and

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,910
then with slices in one slice

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,650
you could run production network and

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,020
then another slices

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,389
you could run experimental network and

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,010
show the new capabilities and again in

00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,680
the research community that idea of

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,840
network slicing and flow wiser got

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,690
immediate attention and then we were

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,820
able to deploy open flow enable networks

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,160
on many campuses around the world and

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,820
they were able to do experimentation on

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,500
production network with slicing now it

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,160
is too bad that at that particular

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,620
concept hasn't really caught on in the

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,120
in the industry as much as yet but if

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,250
you go back and look at the history of

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,680
open flow and flow wiser and all of that

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,830
all of that happened in something like

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,370
mm I mean late to the you know from 2007

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:41,880
to 2010 2011 timeframe and there were at

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:44,430
least 15 or 50 or more institutions that

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,310
we're running open flow with flow wiser

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,349
slicing and demonstrating production

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,900
traffic and experimental research

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,820
traffic running side-by-side on the same

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,789
infrastructure and how innovations can

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,310
happen hopefully industry will catch on

00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:01,919
more and put some of these ideas into

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,440
practice I hope that answers yeah that's

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,330
great yeah so the notion of this

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,550
aggregating of the control/play and the

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,380
data plane I think brought about a whole

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:15,660
new way of networking which is running

00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:18,180
software on x86 posts I want to ask

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,810
Chris this question because I found the

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,400
intersection of open source and Sdn some

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,630
point you know what's happening in

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,349
parallel but that he started to

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,610
intersect as networking became open and

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:32,690
developers started joining the movement

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:36,060
and you know look at how to make these

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,279
composable vnfs and decompose the whole

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,919
notion of a monolithic you know router

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,570
and switch so I wanted to ask you how

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,970
did you see those two movements were to

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,010
come together and was that a perfect

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,870
storm that you know Sdn was

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,340
happening the networking side and while

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,350
on the cloud side you know there was

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,820
this whole open-source movement and the

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,390
developers sort of came together around

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,400
that well it starts with some practical

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,850
issues right engineers you're trying to

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,200
solve real problems and the the

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,210
confluence of events I think was

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,010
interesting was you on the one hand we

00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,960
had academic community producing a

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,240
mechanism for creating programmable

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,350
networks that we hadn't always had so

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,020
when Nick was describing the CEO I

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,700
managed network infrastructure and how

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,170
antiquated that is I was thinking that

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,820
sounds suspiciously like the network

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:29,190
infrastructure that we're managing today

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,950
however building all of this new

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,770
virtualization technology and bringing

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,590
it into into enterprises and and to the

00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:40,080
to the world at large created a need for

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,870
a type of network programmability that I

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,510
think was happening at the same time as

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:49,830
the research and so having tools like

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,870
open-source tools like like open V

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,490
switch being a great example having

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,410
those tools available so that we could

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,270
build the type of network topologies

00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,220
that we we needed in virtualization

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,610
taking advantage of the underlying

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:06,030
concepts not flowvisor concepts and not

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,440
doing experimental networking protocol

00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,360
research but actually just trying to

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,430
connect applications to each other and

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,090
to the rest of the network became a

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,890
really practical application of

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,890
interesting academic research and you

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:22,050
know in the beginning so much hype about

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,000
Sdn and disaggregation and and it's all

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,040
about open flow and one of the things

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,390
that I always wanted to say is it's it's

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,950
not about open flow it's not about a

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,900
protocol it's about a concept and the

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,710
concept is about programmability of the

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:38,520
network and open source is a great way

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,890
to help develop skills and advance the

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,430
industry occur with with a lot of

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:47,700
collaborative effort so taking some core

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,870
tenants from research creating open

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,920
source projects for people to

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,720
collaborate around and solve real

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,900
engineering problems for themselves I

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,790
think was that confluence of events and

00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,530
so to me it's a little bit of the

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,000
virtualization a little bit of of

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,209
academic research coming together just

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,860
there

00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,990
time and then really accelerated with

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,329
with open source code that we can

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,730
collaborate on yeah and I think it's

00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,699
really helping the networking industry

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,839
Drive a whole new wave of innovation

00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:14,759
because I think he opened it up to a

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,399
huge community of developers with new

00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,949
ideas and literally what the cloud

00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,079
anyone can now get some compute

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:25,559
resources and stop developing you know

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,449
networking applications etc I want to

00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,709
kind of take a look at where Sdn is

00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:34,079
today and there are a lot of networking

00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:37,350
open stores communities out there now

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,929
and you know the service providers are

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,179
you know essentially reinventing their

00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:45,149
network and the traditional sort of pop

00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:48,149
and the central office architecture is

00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:50,369
completely being transformed so maybe

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,350
guru you could talk a little bit about

00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:53,879
how that transformation where it is

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,170
today I know you're running the court

00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,509
initiative and there's a lot of

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,119
transformation happening in the sort of

00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,249
the very you know traditional central

00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,899
office space you know where's the

00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:07,769
initiative today and how do you see that

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,509
industry transforming okay so thank you

00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,309
for asking the question as some of you

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,249
may know card is my favorite topic these

00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:15,899
days to talk about so I'm happy to talk

00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:19,019
about that but before I get into that I

00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,119
also want to acknowledge especially AT&T

00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,490
and two gentlemen from AT&T one I can

00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,860
see al Blackburn and Tom insureds

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,559
who kind of brought that focus on

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,119
central offices I still remember al sat

00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,269
me down in one of the conference and

00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:36,149
said it is the stupid central office I

00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,769
mean right sailing that focus your

00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:41,009
attention and central office because

00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:42,959
that is where service provider for spend

00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:45,480
most of their capex and optics on and

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,939
that is what needs to be reinvented and

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,709
he and Tom anxious are the people who

00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:52,259
basically asked us the following

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:54,990
question that if we were to do central

00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,329
offices again clean slate how would we

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,699
do that or another way to pose that

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,799
question is if the cloud people were

00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:03,839
doing central offices that is Google

00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,059
Amazon or someone how would they build

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,549
their central offices and that is what

00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:10,860
got us down the path of doing card

00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:12,600
now yes card have gone tremendous

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,470
traction there are 20 plus providers

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,740
around the world

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,210
deploying card in the lab settings some

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,610
of them want to do field trials and

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,800
production deployments as well and you

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,140
may ask why is that the case that all

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,700
these operators kind of called has

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,290
captured the imagination of these

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,750
operators and I think the answer is

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,390
pretty straightforward we all know that

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:37,650
operators are wanting to rebuild the

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:39,780
network edge because 5g is coming many

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,570
operators want to do gigabit plus

00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:45,840
broadband access to their residential

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:48,120
customers okay and then the edges where

00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,150
they can innovate new services and

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,150
revenue generating services to be able

00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,490
to take advantage of 5g take advantage

00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,070
of gigabit plus broadband access and so

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,770
on and the central offices are very very

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,440
old and so building this new edge is

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,050
almost mandatory as well as what they

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,430
want to do and now when they want to

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,680
think about building this new network

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,050
edge obviously they want to do it with

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,600
this new software-defined networking

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,600
open source they want to do it with

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,100
disaggregation white boxes and all of

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,780
that that is how they want to do build

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,300
the new network edge they don't want to

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,010
do it the old-fashioned way and what God

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,290
has done is to bring all of this thing

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,660
together in a single platform or a

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,820
solution where you can support gigabit

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,190
broadband access using merchants silicon

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,040
white boxes open source you can try to

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,960
support disaggregated radios with x-ray

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,660
and excellent controller you can do

00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,700
disaggregation of EPC and virtualize APC

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,850
and Cod brings all of this thing

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,530
together in a single platform that one

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,200
could deploy and that is one of the

00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,490
reasons we are seeing lot of interest

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,460
that it is bringing all of these ideas

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:00,000
into a single platform and hopefully it

00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,640
will continue yeah so I think the the

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,520
concept of this aggregation is being

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,790
applied everywhere central office pops

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,560
data centers and there are multiple

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,480
abstraction layers now there are getting

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,920
formed and you know looking at

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,250
essentially how to provide a simpler

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,290
interface to developers I want to ask

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,360
you Nick with the p4 initiative that

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,130
you're driving how is that abstraction

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,510
there was a p4 programming language

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,410
really changing the

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:30,270
a packet forwarding engine so I think

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,330
it's worth to to think about the

00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:36,480
following question why is it that it

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:40,080
takes so long for networking equipment

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,110
to add a new feature when VX LAN was

00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:46,170
first defined by vmware and cisco in

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,510
2010 it was four years before that

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,950
feature showed up in silicon it's

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,830
because we've got used to the idea that

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,140
silicon is fixed-function

00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:57,120
if you can take those things which are

00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,610
fixed in silicon and lift them up and

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,680
out the protocols and features so that

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,190
they're defined in software then

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,840
software developers will add ideas that

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,540
we had never thought of about how to

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,370
simplify improve make more reliable make

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:15,300
more secure than network that they're

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,710
running today network behavior the way

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,930
in which packets flow through a network

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,670
are determined by chip designers and

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:24,510
chip designers don't operate in big

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:27,680
networks so with few of us got together

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:32,130
in about 2013 from Google and Microsoft

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,990
Intel barefoot and a few others to to

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,090
try and figure out could you define a

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,970
language which ended up being called p4

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,640
for defining the forwarding behavior of

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:45,060
packets in a network we had this sense

00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:48,030
that Sdn had made that put the control

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,370
plane in the hands of those who own and

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,490
operate networks how could you put the

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,020
forwarding behavior in their hands to

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,390
how could you make it so that somebody

00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,980
could change the behavior of the way the

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,750
packets were processed because if you

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,070
can't change the way that packets are

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,270
process you're not really in control of

00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,040
the network because all the network does

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,150
is pass packets around really at the end

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,740
of the day at all it does it passes

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,180
packets around and processing them a

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,500
little bit as they go by if you can't

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,050
change the behavior then you're not in

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,720
control so the p4 language was designed

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,190
to allow that lifting up and out so that

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,990
other people the software developers

00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,820
some people refer to it as a as a

00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,410
Cambrian explosion that you would expect

00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,209
to take place it doesn't mean that

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,100
everything gets far more complicated in

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,959
many cases people will use it to reduce

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,560
the complexity down to what they

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,360
actually need so how do you see it's

00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,090
switch gears and move to the future how

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,290
do you see you know with these different

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,540
initiatives that are happy

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,670
you know poured and P for programmable

00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,460
language providing the abstraction layer

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,140
that makes it even easier how is that

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,090
going to shape the future of SDI what

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,860
are your thoughts on that so what it

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:56,340
takes is for a community effort to pile

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,380
on and be involved so with P for dog

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,440
there's a hundred companies that are

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,060
members of that that organization

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,220
contributing code modifying the behavior

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,930
of their networks contributing tools and

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,220
compilers and things like that for core

00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,310
there are many operators that are

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:15,420
deploying it so as we have this

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,710
community growing then there is a

00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,510
there's a little bit of a risk of

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,220
fragmentation as we all go off in

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,020
different directions and so finding a

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,640
balance and we all have a common

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,400
interest here which is to create

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,710
production quality software from odl

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,910
from owners from cord from p4 from all

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,570
of these different these different

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:35,580
efforts so that we can all take charge

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,350
of the networks that we own and operate

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,300
and so it will be it will come from that

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,390
need and from that need from the

00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,690
community in an environment where we can

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,650
create lots of new ideas we've got to be

00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,990
careful that we don't become too

00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,760
attached to those ideas because that's

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,840
where the fragmentation comes from so we

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,030
need to find that right balance so

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,860
working together in that ecosystem in a

00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,110
meritocrat assay where we share openly

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,960
the ideas that we have I think that's

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,700
what will give us a path to much more

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,700
open source use in our network that we

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,260
share as an ecosystem so so Chris a

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,530
question for you as Nick was talking

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,900
about the you know notion just having

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,630
more control of the data playing the

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,610
forwarding playing there's a notion out

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:21,840
there that there is this intent based

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:23,910
you know networking concept and I wanted

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,630
to ask you how how is intent based

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:30,300
networking you know really help

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:33,180
developers operators to have better

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,670
control of the packet forwarding the

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,060
policy engine and how does that come

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,560
together so everything can be solved

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,450
with another layer of abstraction and

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,160
tenant based networking isn't is

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,220
intending to create a higher level

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,560
abstraction so that you can define your

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,759
goals in a language that's relatively

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,539
simple divorce

00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,959
from the underlying implementation

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:57,449
details um so I think that's it's a very

00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:59,639
powerful concept like anything else you

00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:01,859
we always have to kind of distinguish

00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:04,669
between the excitement and the hype and

00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:07,169
the reality but policy based management

00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:10,079
not even Network specific the policy

00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:11,339
based management is absolutely a thrust

00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,259
in the industry because what we're doing

00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:18,149
is continuing to build more and more

00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:20,159
complex systems complexity needs some

00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:22,320
level of abstraction to help operators

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,999
manage the complexity otherwise you're

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,119
going to drown in in in all of the

00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:29,219
details so intent based networking is is

00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,769
an example of that you know bring bring

00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:34,319
the abstraction layer a level higher use

00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:36,449
something that's declarative describe

00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:40,859
your intents not describe the details of

00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:43,399
IP addresses and and ports and apples

00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:47,149
and all the kind of header level details

00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:50,519
it's an important step but I think the

00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:54,299
the overall picture here is we're trying

00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:56,159
to build next generation networks at one

00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,469
level I think we're trying to really

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,329
simplify the fabric and maybe move

00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:03,119
complexity into software where we can

00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:04,709
manage that complexity a little bit more

00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,429
rapidly because hardware does have some

00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:11,159
lifecycle limitations and at the same

00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:14,129
time find enough commonality that we

00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,169
don't create a new set of complications

00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:18,569
for ourselves as an industry if you look

00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,999
back at the evolution of of networking

00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,619
we've had a proliferation of standards

00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:26,129
there's a lot of ways to do similar

00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:27,839
things and we're going to do something

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:30,029
similar in open source communities will

00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,649
develop a lot of ways to do do similar

00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:34,409
things and I think what's challenging

00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:36,719
for us as a broad industry is finding

00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:39,179
the Best of Breed ways to do that and

00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:41,940
and really accelerating those as core

00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,299
focus areas including the software for

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,039
the industry so that we don't create

00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,419
fragmentation and you know part of that

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,219
fragmentation is a lack of

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,440
interoperability but part of that

00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:54,119
fragmentation is just focus and we have

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,709
finite resources across the industry

00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:58,679
both from an operation side and a

00:21:55,709 --> 00:22:01,819
developer side and there's a tension

00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,659
between innovation and kind of

00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:06,909
contraction that that brings focus on on

00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,859
a smaller set of project so kind of an

00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:11,799
exciting time for me and in that sense

00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:14,109
but it is hard to figure out how to work

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,519
together as broad communities across

00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,710
these different projects and find

00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,590
whether it's intent-based or whether

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:23,200
it's you know some some next AI driven

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,849
autonomous networks you know all these

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,139
concepts are really exciting but finding

00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,940
the key ones that we can focus on

00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:30,039
together I think is where the real power

00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,769
and benefit will come from yeah I do

00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,559
think that unification is very critical

00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:38,979
for the networking community to scale

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,690
and drive even more innovation it's it's

00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:42,190
interesting there's a trend of you know

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,720
the community sort of you know created

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,570
all these different open-source projects

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,029
and you know there were a lot of ideas

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,440
ODL and Opie and Ivy and owners and

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:52,479
there were a lot of these projects and

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,149
somehow I think it's coming back

00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:57,429
together again and there's unification

00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:59,409
not only at the organizational through a

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:00,999
community level but also at the

00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:02,739
technology level and some of these

00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:05,259
abstraction layers are coming together I

00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:07,299
think this conference it's been exciting

00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:10,210
because there's a lot of talk about AI

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,119
and you know the convergence of these

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,889
technologies are kind of coming together

00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:20,169
guru I want to ask you you know looking

00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:22,599
forward you know Sdn in next 10 years if

00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:24,220
you have your crystal ball what would

00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,809
you say about you know some of the

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,919
emerging things that you see today and

00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:30,009
how is that going to change the

00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,359
direction of Sdn in the next 10 years as

00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:33,070
you know in the thing in the technology

00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,289
sector making predictions is not a wise

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,779
thing to do so I think I wouldn't want

00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:40,629
to give you any predictions of that type

00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:43,269
but I think general trends I think that

00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:45,580
are so I think that I you can look at

00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:47,259
technology trends and where or the area

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,070
that they would get applied so I mean I

00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:54,099
think another thing earlier that edge is

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,139
definitely not because of court but in

00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,149
general I would think that in the

00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:59,710
service provider industry the edge of

00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:03,190
the network will definitely go through a

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:06,309
major transformation and I think it is

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:08,979
pretty clear that when that edge

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:11,440
transformation happens we will be

00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:14,349
leveraging Sdn disaggregation white

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,120
boxes open source in all of that and I

00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:18,590
think that will

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,780
you know will mean I think all the

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,250
trends suggest that that is you know we

00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,960
are on a path to doing that and that

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:29,090
will happen in that space I'm also I

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,040
mean I think Chris alluded to this to

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,360
some extent I think the if you still go

00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,850
back and look at some of the early

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,700
papers and sdn I personally think that

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:41,050
we still have ways to go to realize the

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:45,320
full potential of Sdn because what was

00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:47,360
conceived even early papers of Sdn is

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,650
that through this logical centralization

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,990
of the control plane and the

00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,730
configuration you have a global view

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,520
that represent forwarding state

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,500
performance state and configuration

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,200
state and once you bring all of that

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,420
state at one look place then there are

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,310
many many opportunities to do things in

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,490
terms of network verification micro

00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:09,770
debugging kind of change management how

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,080
you do it the kinds of thing that the

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:15,140
intent based networking and so all of

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,660
this software stack and tool chain that

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,240
can be build on top of that logically

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,100
centralized control plane all that work

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,170
is still needs to be done whether it is

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,420
a I play the role in it and machine

00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:29,900
learning play the role in it that is to

00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:33,320
me the secondary but all that you can

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,420
say exploitation of real Sdn it still

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,340
needs to be done and I think it will be

00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,020
done and I want to make this one last

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,730
thing that is if you look at where

00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,950
Google is going I know a lot of times we

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,410
say Google is very different but Google

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,690
has already moved quite a bit in terms

00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,610
of logically centralized Sdn control

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,510
plane and on top of that building this

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,740
tool chain that is helping them get both

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:57,110
agility as well as very high

00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,090
availability of their infrastructure so

00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:02,030
they talk about being able to do changes

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,950
maybe once a day or a few times in a

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,140
week and at the same time making sure

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,360
nothing is breaking in their network and

00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,130
that is because of the fact that they

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,320
are exploiting some of these Sdn

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,420
capabilities and I hope the rest of the

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,870
industry will do the same going forward

00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:21,950
great so we have just about three

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:23,690
minutes left I want to just ask the

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,910
panelists this is probably a question in

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,640
the audience minds as well we have a

00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:31,540
community of operators

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,920
you know open-source developers

00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:37,490
end-users you know people who deploy

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,920
networks out there any sort of you know

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,750
recommendations and how they could

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,360
contribute towards the growth of open

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,010
networking and you know how can we

00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,960
collectively shape the direction of

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:50,120
networking in the next 10 years so maybe

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,310
I'll start with you Nick so you know

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,930
this Sdn is a bit of a funny name and

00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,640
software to find out working as Vince

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,230
said it's already defined in software

00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,320
what is it actually about like nearly

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:03,350
all disruptions in in networking this

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,420
disruption is about moving who is in

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,060
charge moving who is in control it's

00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,460
moving from the control being inside the

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,910
box closed and proprietary into your

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,080
hands as the network owner and operator

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,900
so that's the change that's actually

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,360
going on this change only actually

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,610
happens if the receiving end there are

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,260
people who are willing to learn about

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:28,190
the open source get involved in the

00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:30,410
ecosystem contribute that's how that

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,970
change actually comes to fruition so

00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,340
there's a handing over of the keys

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,530
that's taking place and the keys have to

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,350
be grabbed and that takes a lot of time

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,690
a lot of commitment a lot of effort and

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,380
that's what will actually bring this to

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,150
fruition

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,040
whichever project that happens to be and

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:50,210
whichever part of this ecosystem that

00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:52,880
happens to be kuru yes I think I also

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,460
like the Lynx answer to the question

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,790
that our proposed aim at the end and for

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,410
wind to say the following that now for

00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,540
this generation of people there is

00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,630
another opportunity to recreate the

00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,160
internet I thought that was the most

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,050
inspiring thing I have heard from

00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,170
somebody who is the father of Internet

00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:14,750
and so if that doesn't inspire you I

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,610
don't know what can so I think I really

00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,100
feel that with either with because of

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,920
Sdn because of disaggregation because of

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,390
open networking for our generation I'm

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,520
getting also getting old but some of the

00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:27,560
near and the younger people this is your

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,360
another opportunity and that comes once

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,430
in lifetime where you have an

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,410
opportunity to kind of reinvent the

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,330
infrastructure of the society the most

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,830
important infrastructure of the society

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,870
because of the changes that are

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:42,049
happening so I hope you will grab it and

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:45,570
do exciting things with that

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:46,320
well starting point I'll happily make a

00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,470
prediction

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,639
Sdn at 20 will be really really an

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:57,980
open-source movement so to to next point

00:28:53,639 --> 00:29:00,870
getting involved is how you can manage

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,870
influencing this direction so I think

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:06,059
Sdn is about you know unlocking the

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,669
potential of the network in the context

00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:11,360
of applications and users not just the

00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:15,059
operators trying to connect two ends of

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:18,059
two different separate endpoints getting

00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:20,850
involved looking at how you change your

00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:22,860
own mindset and skills because many of

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,840
the operational practices that we see

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,809
today and networks don't translate into

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,600
kind of a software world where things

00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:33,090
move rapidly and we look at being able

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,159
to make small consistent incremental

00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,799
changes rather than big bang rollout

00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,049
changes so getting involved and really

00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,639
being open to to new techniques and new

00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:44,129
tools and new technologies I think is

00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:46,799
how together we can create the next

00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:52,830
generation the next the new internet

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:55,139
internet three I guess sounds good I

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,519
guess you know my last word to everybody

00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:59,759
is that the community is extremely

00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:02,129
important and I thank all of you for

00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,049
your contributions and regardless of

00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:07,259
what your role is you may be a developer

00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:09,960
you may be an operator you might be you

00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:12,629
know a tech writer there are many

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,840
different ways to contribute to to the

00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:17,490
projects so you know regardless what

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,250
your role is and which one of the

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,799
open-source networking projects you're

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,389
involved in continue to contribute you

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,789
know we deeply appreciate it you're

00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:29,460
making the difference and you are

00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:32,429
essentially shaping the future of Sdn in

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,860
the next ten years so with that I want

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,659
to give everyone a huge round of thanks

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,000
for being here and being part of the

00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,660
community and let's give a round of

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,559
applause to our panelists

00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:47,559
