good afternoon everyone Wow we've got a

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,420
full house thank you everyone for coming

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,049
to beautiful Los Angeles the weather is

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,059
amazing down here you know it's rainy

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,039
up in San Francisco for the last couple

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,960
of weeks so we were happy that we were

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,210
able to plan this event down here in

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,869
beautiful Southern California and we're

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,619
glad to see you all here today I want to

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,720
start by first welcoming you and

00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:33,180
thanking our sponsors I'd like to thank

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,280
our diamond sponsors arm and Intel

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,809
without them we could not make this

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,899
happen so let's give a big round of

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:46,050
applause for them also like to thank our

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,629
platinum sponsors Alibaba cloud Dell EMC

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:54,030
Ericsson and Huawei thanks again for all

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:56,730
your support so a couple of years ago we

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:02,239
declared that it was the year of open

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:04,799
source in networking and that has been

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,260
proven really true I think today what

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,650
we're really seeing is an almost or

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,180
certainly on every level of the stack

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,150
there's an open source project that's

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,369
innovative and solving big problems in

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,619
creating value whether it's you know at

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,840
the low layer and data plane services or

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,330
all the way up into the management and

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,520
orchestration frameworks open-source is

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,159
really leading but this year we're

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,310
seeing a big shift in the networking

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,170
sector as it relates to open source and

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,600
I want to just take a couple of minutes

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,869
to remind us all of just how powerful

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,680
that is and how we're really at the

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,530
beginning of the real innovation that is

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,170
here to come you know what what's really

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,079
happened is you see all these different

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,049
open source projects that have come up

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,320
whether it's court or open daylight or

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,420
more recent projects like own app that

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,509
are really solving these tough problems

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,350
the important thing now is that that

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:10,530
open source project or collection of

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,830
projects is being turned into real

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,700
market solutions own app as

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,650
example is being used in production in

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:23,670
operator networks like Bell Canada and

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,130
AT&T opendaylight another example is

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,010
being used to run networks that powers

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,460
over a billion subscribers you know

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,230
we're really now starting to see

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,600
industry and the telecommunications

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,780
sector take this open source and build

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,730
real solutions on top of it and what

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,130
happens when you start building real

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,980
solutions with open source is you start

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,800
creating a lot of value whether it's in

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,800
Network automation enabling 5g

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,100
transformation whether it's in you know

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,810
investment and additional new companies

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,990
that are invested in to support these

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:04,020
open source projects profit and values

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,890
being created and what happens then is

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:11,430
that value gets reinvested back in the

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:14,160
open source projects in the form of new

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,110
requirements that unearthed themselves

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,660
when they're being when that project is

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:22,860
being used to run a global operators

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,320
networks it takes the place in terms of

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,989
new features and services in that

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,870
project which then baguettes better

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,840
solutions that are commercial products

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,900
which begets more value which begets

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,850
more code more innovation better

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,250
products and solutions faster networks

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,130
more secure networks more value more

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,050
reinvestment and you can see how this

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,940
flywheel

00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:51,570
really really happens and that's really

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,709
what we're all here to do today is to

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,330
invest in making this flywheel this

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,310
open-source project turning into

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,800
commercial products and services

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,800
creating value that is then reinvested

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,620
to go faster and faster and faster and

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,420
it's working and I want to thank all of

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,530
you for participating in it and give

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,040
each of you a round of applause for

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,040
helping

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,190
but we're not stopping there we've been

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,070
working on networking and now what we're

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,350
seeing is new technologies coming in to

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,780
help networking and all a bunch of other

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,699
sectors of technology improve and that's

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,180
in the area of deep learning and

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:35,539
artificial intelligence today the Linux

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,770
Foundation is announcing the LF deep

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:38,150
learning project actually I think was

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,370
yesterday we've got so many different

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:44,000
announcements but this project was

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,970
announced with ten initial members it

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,729
has open source a seed project in the

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,729
Accu Mo's project how many people here

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:54,560
have heard of a queue Mo's okay if you

00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:57,770
haven't go check it out this is an

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,910
amazing framework for the discovery and

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:04,370
sharing of AI models and AI workflows so

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,889
this was initially contributed by AT&T

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,070
and tech mahindra but it's just an a

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,740
tremendously useful tool to be able to

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,389
take an AI model deploy it in a

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,130
production environment and then share

00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,080
those models with others whether it's

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,750
within your organization or other

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,639
organizations outside of your own and

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,220
when we got started on this we got so

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,120
much interest in other technologies

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,250
around AI that we started a whole

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,300
umbrella organization for artificial

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,880
intelligence called

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,210
LF deep learning that's been joined like

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,729
I said by ten new organization we're

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,440
gonna see more projects in this Baidu

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:44,449
for example is contributing their

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,699
elastic deep learning project

00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,580
Tencent is bringing in their angel

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:53,270
project and we'll see more projects to

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,070
come so go and check out the LF deep

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,849
learning project we think this is going

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,740
to be a big one finally I have a one

00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:03,830

for all of us to work together I truly

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,610
wish I was there but I look forward to

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:13,200
meeting all of you and thanks for the

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:16,980
opportunity to say hi thanks Jamie so

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,590
more news to come but with that I'm

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,880
going to introduce our Pitts Joshi poro

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,710
who heads up the Linux Foundation

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:31,010
networking group please welcome our bit

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:36,390
[Music]

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:38,400
all right networking actually worked we

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,820
were scared that the call would not go

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,450
through all right so welcome everybody

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,610
again I'm honored to be the voice of the

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,010
community here and really humbled by the

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,330
progress we have made in just one year

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,810
right whether it's developers

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:59,070
programmers project managers program

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:01,680
managers members executives end-users

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,390
you know you name it even press an

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,850
analyst you know they are keeping up

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,880
with what we do so it's really really

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,230
amazing and I think the key here is you

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,270
know the willingness to work together

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,410
has really made a difference so I'm

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:18,240
really you know excited about this event

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,580
we're more today than we were at the

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,560
previous ons so that's really exciting

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,090
and we're not even in the Bay Area we're

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,160
in Hollywood right so that's really

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,040
exciting so in the next few minutes I'm

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,360
gonna walk you through the progress and

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:36,390
you know I'll show you where we are

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,570
heading next so a year ago at ons I sort

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,990
of gave out two messages one was

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,660
networking

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:46,530
let's make networking cool again okay

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,780
and let's harmonize harness and consume

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,930
and what that meant really was let's all

00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:55,290
work together within networking and the

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,550
key here is within in terms of you know

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:02,910
open source projects standards etc and I

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,750
think we have done a great job and I

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,090
want to thank you

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,840
right so the community came together

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,400
very nicely

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,890
and I'll show you some highlights here

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,090
but I think everybody here in the

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,210
audience and people who are listening

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,860
will agree with me so please give you a

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,940
little give yourself a round of applause

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,030
thank you

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:25,150
very good so let me explain a few

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:27,900
highlights the two most important things

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,180
that our members were focusing on was

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,100
can you merge open source communities

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,200
that are either adjacent complementary

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,300
or overlapping and we did that we did

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,000
that the largest hit merge in the

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,620
history has been pulled in terms of open

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,620
source and that was the ecomp and open

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:47,080
all with own app now becoming the de

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,810
facto platform because the merge global

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,690
adoption etc the other thing we did was

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,310
we merged six projects into a single

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,740
elif's networking umbrella from a

00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,480
governance perspective while keeping the

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,210
technical communities independent and

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,940
that has been really well received from

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,250
and well coordinated across across the

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,760
community and that was not just within

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:13,020
LF that's part of ons we announced

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,910
partnership with OCP as as you well know

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:21,550
last week and it was extremely you know

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,930
well-received coming from giants of open

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,660
source hardware and open source software

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,780
and the collaboration is not just on end

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,150
to end testing but also on that common

00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:35,230
layer of operating systems that touch

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,690
both hardware and software we also had

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,000
an announcement going without app and

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,610
cord coexisting in an AT&T access

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,500
network and the collaboration there so a

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,390
lot of good progress these are just few

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,560
examples that I want to sort of give out

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:53,590
and that's the open source community

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,840
open standards you know have really

00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,490
fascinated and the way you know there is

00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,590
willingness on both sides to make this

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,930
happen this was a big sticking point

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,120
last year and we started off with

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,950
collaboration with onf and you know

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,620
standards in the open flow area etcetera

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,120
for sure but very soon we had meth and

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,040
Linux Foundation and onap collaborate

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,710
and that collaboration allowed us to

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,850
talk carriers to carriers you know the

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:24,130
legato interlude sonata interfaces that

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,830
we all love and and and we want to go

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,870
across carriers right and that demo was

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,720
shown by a whole set of member community

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,710
very well received okay and then we made

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,640
even further

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:41,590
yes when last week you know the baseline

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:43,870
p4 was announced as moving or joining

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,420
both a left networking and onf led by

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:49,840
Owen F Internet I love networking and

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,460
that again shows the pre harmonization

00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,280
aspect of it which brings everything

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,590
together and then yesterday we announced

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,590
TM forum from an API perspective so you

00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:02,220
can see that we are moving forward we

00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,820
are facilitating enabling any roadblocks

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,050
that you know prevent deployment or

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,420
prevent our members from collaborating

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,900
so we're really excited about that okay

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,510
and why is this really important and why

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,270
does it matter because the community

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:21,820
likes it and so the results are in

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,200
we just touched hundred members in 11

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,110
networking in less than hundred days

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,540
okay so this is really exciting because

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,450
this is like one of the fastest times to

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,060
get 200 members and this is just the

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,790
result of how efficient it is to just

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,850
become and participate and and look at

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,400
multiple projects all in one so again

00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,560
thank you very much so with that said

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,320
this is all clubbed under what I call

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,140
harmonization one dot oh okay and one

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,750
dot oh again is within networking both

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:57,870
open source projects and open source and

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,870
standards and so why is this important

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,290
it's all about money eleven billion

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,470
dollars is at stake in the next five

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,480
years one of the analysts firms ACG

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,950
research came out with a report today

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,300
that has analyzed both qualitatively and

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,650
quantitatively what it means to be

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,140
participating in the next five years of

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:23,350
spen that the end users are going after

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,880
and there are significant you know data

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,070
in there but the one I thought was very

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,530
interesting was you know the amount of

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,710
money at stake and another key

00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:34,210
observation that that I want to sort of

00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:38,100
highlight here is the future strategic

00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:41,320
vendors that are participating in this

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,900
unfair share of spend will be the ones

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,630
that embrace open source okay

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,250
and most of this open source

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,460
is at the interface layer it's at the

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,350
boundaries right it is what I have

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,300
lovingly called the boring part of

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,270
networks okay but that's the most

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,100
complex and the most important so with

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,530
that said where are we heading

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,950
we're heading to harmonization Todaro

00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:10,830
and what does todaro mean to dato means

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:15,060
how networking impacts adjacent areas

00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:19,390
whether it's adjacent technologies

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:21,580
adjacent clouds projects areas you name

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,580
it right I don't have a word for it but

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,920
what it means is it's not just within

00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,130
networking it's beyond networking and so

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:34,030
what we have looked at as a networking

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:37,780
group is you know how do I get the best

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:40,060
of network automation with the best of

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,890
cloud and container portability right

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,190
that's kind of the kubernetes and

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,160
networking sort of collaboration how do

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,050
I get the best of hardware and software

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,680
to be you know independent of each other

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:56,380
with a layer of operating system that we

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,620
are announcing today called dana's this

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,680
aggregated network operating system the

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,660
interesting thing about dana's which the

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,819
most of the seed code comes from an AT&T

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,530
project called Dinah's but the

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,890
interesting thing is it comes in pre

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:15,160
harmonized with all five of the pieces

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,829
in the operating system landscape right

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,230
we've had the bright brightest of the

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:23,230
bright come together in a room for

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:26,829
multiple times and figured out how say

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:30,970
the sonic and the sigh layer how the

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:35,080
stratum and the forwarding layer how FRR

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:37,780
an open switch and dana's they all work

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,180
together and how the interfaces are all

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,310
coming together so stay tuned for more

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,920
details but we're really excited because

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:48,100
we want to go in with a view and an

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,420
architecture view of how these five you

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,950
know switches come together including

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,240
you know open switch and a couple of

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,350
them are already Lenox foundation

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,380
projects okay

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:59,059
the other area that is important to

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,480
networking is what Jim announced deepler

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:05,389
akwimos and obviously there is a network

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,019
tie-in for this but we want to make sure

00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:10,429
that there is more analytics and machine

00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,080
learning applied to the network

00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:13,850
automation to get more powerful use

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,899
cases and then finally what was

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,129
announced you know or what will was was

00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:20,870
announced in January which was the

00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:23,090
kirino statutes is the new edge stack

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:25,909
and you will see some more exciting news

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,470
around that as well so again the key

00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:30,379
here is the zero touch vision of

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,450
end-to-end services including next-gen

00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:34,639
services so how does it all fit together

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,570
I think it's fairly straightforward for

00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:38,929
those of you who have seen the

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,639
architectural vision from from LF it's a

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,409
very simple problem you have to connect

00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:43,879
these services at the top to the

00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,100
infrastructure at the bottom and the

00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:48,320
middle layers is all disjoint and manual

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,690
and things like that and you have a

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,700
bunch of our open source organizations

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,440
working together to create that

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,809
automation layer and that framework so

00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,559
we are really excited and to show

00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:03,679
harmonization 2.0 I was I just said

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,840
let's do a quick demonstration on you

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,419
know one of the projects on how you know

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,019
we can see the power of containers and

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:14,690
cloud working with network automation so

00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:17,330
this is a demonstration of onap on on on

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,700
kubernetes and effectively what we have

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,730
is two high velocity projects that are

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,789
coming together now I was going to go to

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,669
the let demo live and then I chickened

00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:31,429
out sorry right I just can't trust

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,679
myself going down to the CLI and the

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:34,580
shell level so I've done that before but

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,619
I'm not gonna do it

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,590
there's too many engineers here you can

00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:42,019
who can see through my fluff so I'm just

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:44,570
going to give you a high-level view of

00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:47,720
what the power is and then if you need

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,399
to see the real demo there's a there's a

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,440
boot that has the demo going on so let

00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:53,240
me just show you where some of the

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,970
interesting things are happening so this

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,999
is a dashboard and this is a cross cloud

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:02,149
CI so again remember CN CF the umbrella

00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:04,669
organization has kubernetes as a project

00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:07,730
there's a cross cloud team under that

00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:10,909
that's working on this on onap you have

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,390
a team under you know a project called

00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:15,210
Oh

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,100
that is working on this and and what

00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,690
they do is you know they work and

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,799
collaborate on that plus there is a

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:25,529
multi VIN or multiple clouds team so

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,919
this is a dashboard all you can see here

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:32,039
is on the top you have all the clouds so

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,679
Amazon is your Google IBM bare-metal

00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:38,659
OpenStack etc and kubernetes and all its

00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:42,960
projects including own app right here is

00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:45,630
what we are going to show running on on

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,520
kubernetes okay so effectively this is a

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,440
daily build you know you display the

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,140
test results and any or all sorts of the

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,549
cloud so let's go ahead and get started

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,559
the first thing you would end up doing

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:57,929
is creating a pipeline now we have taken

00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:00,809
a portion of own app here just for

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:02,610
expediting thing and and it takes the

00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:05,240
latest amsterdam release for those of

00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:08,039
you are familiar with own app 1.1.1 and

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,679
and all we're gonna do is you know is

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:14,039
create this pipeline here and so let's

00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,289
say the pipeline get started you know

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,110
and and it has its what it's doing is

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:21,480
own app has its own CI system they have

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,929
a release build system the to talk and

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,779
now you take the orchestrator put it

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:30,090
down for testing and now you're going to

00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,590
sort of compile this i can't put the

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,799
laser pointer all the way there but

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:37,850
that's fine and then it starts compiling

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:43,230
and then in about ten or fifteen minutes

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:45,210
this whole thing bills takes the latest

00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,000
version the next thing that happens is

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:51,299
kubernetes starts deploying in parallel

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,250
across all these clouds right and it

00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:56,279
runs in parallel right which is what we

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:59,760
want and then when completed that task

00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:01,770
gets to deploying the own app on each of

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,140
these cloud service providers right and

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,690
once that happens and you know it's

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,480
going to run through its completion you

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:12,779
get to everything is good to go so let's

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,750
kind of look at the couple of clouds so

00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:19,470
let's say if i go and look at the AWS

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:21,750
portion of it here's your console output

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,370
here obviously i'm not expecting anybody

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,100
to read this

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,110
the key here is it's it's kind of AWS

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,420
we're own app has been deployed with the

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,330
Amsterdam release all the tests have

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:37,230
passed so these are healthcare checks

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:39,840
health checks consoles logins database

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,120
services things like that and and kind

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,400
of you know

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,200
let's take OpenStack for example here if

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,360
you sort of double click and do that

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,780
that console looks similar you know it's

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:57,180
just simple enough right so my point

00:22:51,780 --> 00:23:01,110
here is you now have an example of how

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,700
you know cloud portability and you know

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,450
kubernetes comes in and look our

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,220
container portability and own app our

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,020
projects like own app can take advantage

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,940
of right now this is again a demo and

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,370
you know we'll work with the community

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,050
and and make this happen but I thought

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,710
it is interesting to just show you the

00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:21,270
power of how harmonization to and to

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,400
open-source projects can come together

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:26,070
and of course you know you can contact

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,460
dan or the cross cloud team at the boot

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:32,700
and of course special thanks to the onap

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:36,540
team in in the Amdocs organization so

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,820
that's it and then one final slide I

00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,670
have to put this up this is my favorite

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,730
slide and we just updated it so there

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,660
was a slide here last year so the two

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,710
updates I want to show is as

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,280
harmonization two happens we are now

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:56,550
beyond the networking we are you know

00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,130
going across multiple other projects and

00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,870
so we have emphasised the lower layer of

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,910
the stacks if you may with the operating

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,760
systems and how they all fit together

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,230
we've also emphasized not just Linux

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,850
Foundation projects but the Linux

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,650
Foundation projects that are part of

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,900
networking as well as Linux Foundation

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,180
and non Linux Foundation projects so

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,580
they they all come together and I know

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,800
it is hard to understand how they you

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,020
know how they harmonize but once you

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,900
participate in the community it's a

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:29,400
really really powerful thing to do okay

00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:32,280
so that's kind of the start off ons and

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,540
my statements and thank you all for

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,600
coming

00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,600
