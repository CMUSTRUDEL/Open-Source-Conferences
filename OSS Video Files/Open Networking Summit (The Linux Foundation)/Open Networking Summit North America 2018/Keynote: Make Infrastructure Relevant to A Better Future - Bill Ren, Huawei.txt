	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
morning everyone I'm very glad to be

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,849
here to introduce about our thoughts

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,610
about a networking infrastructure so my

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:18,449
topic is how to make infrastructure more

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:20,640
relevant to a better future so as we all

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,529
say we're already on the way of a

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,130
digital society so life has been

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,349
digitalized and also the industry also

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,099
make a lot of progress in digitalization

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,760
for example in shipping the largest a

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,790
terminal started running in Shanghai

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,160
last year it's already only round by non

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,980
staffs and the largest the largest

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,910
occurs smart warehouse owned by Alibaba

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,850
is only run by 60 robots so for this for

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:55,410
digitalization which brings a core value

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,809
of automation and high efficiency so

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,149
come for future

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:03,359
it's a will be all connected intelligent

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,189
for digital society it definitely will

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,740
bring more demands for the

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,930
infrastructure that give us a to

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,180
challenge the full admission and the

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,310
extreme high efficiency how to achieve

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:20,970
this there's one observation may help so

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,670
pass the two decades we think there is a

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,680
too big shift in the in industry why is

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,689
for go unlock the other is a go cloud

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,090
there there are few common scenes we

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,540
observed first the all change the way of

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,700
the deal change the way of consuming the

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,110
products the other thing is the the

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,770
stimulate has a consumption and expanded

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,200
the market in large scale and another

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,640
point is also most important is the all

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,649
changes by building a platform that

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,659
interpreted the intent from the user had

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,079
the complexity and the pride of the

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,110
simplicity and a convenient and the user

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:07,500
that's why it indeed as for coming to

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:11,370
for digitalization when new platform may

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,690
need to be built to leash the power and

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,770
the efficiency of the networking

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,290
infrastructure

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,370
but how to achieve this and how to build

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,160
this platform we think no one

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,330
communities along an industry platform

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,710
for an intended remember is needed so

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,830
there are four aspects need to be

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,800
considered architecture modeling

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:38,990
collaboration and the ecosystem and we

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,570
are talking by one so for architecture

00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:45,210
so this diagram indicate has we really

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,220
need to consider the architecture from

00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,560
end to end of life circa of operating

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,170
and network start from a procure

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,320
embodying a we have two other designer

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:58,410
service and the truant and even tests

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,480
and verified so that we are bring the

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,110
intended river and the simplicity to the

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,420
application so the yellow path is a

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:09,990
automation platform there are three key

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,390
factors here first is model driven this

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,760
we are decompose the service design

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:20,130
adjustment assurance from the platform

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,260
and disease indicators as no layer the

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,240
concept too much here all the modules

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,460
talk to each other equally based on

00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:31,580
youant and the secondary is codeless we

00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,140
can see there are two closed-loop

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,560
separated a design team from the runtime

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:41,520
and this we okay were extremely reduce

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,180
the unsaid customization effort and the

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,130
rigidity to the service and another

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,890
thing is important to his activities

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,290
flexibility and the architecture should

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,960
be allowed should be easily adapt into

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,290
any new technologies for example the

00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,320
service or craft TB and the one most

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,690
thing I have to emphasize is all the

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,030
architecture discussion should be based

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:11,250
on code to avoid the ambiguity and

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,650
conceptualization we have spent a lot of

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,640
time debating too many technologies

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,040
let's not waste our time

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,900
so for modeling I think the talk about

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,090
the service integration people easily

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,870
mention the interface but ID like terms

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,210
as modeling that's a key behind the inn

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,720
so for modern ins there are two key

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:38,100
challenges first it's difficult to reach

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,860
consensus second even consensus is there

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,300
it's even more harder to adapt it

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,740
because of the high cost of

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,800
implementation so how to deal with this

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,850
missing to simplify the service in a to

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:58,230
tear that's service and the resource the

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,610
model it's both recursive and also the

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:04,470
service model more focus on

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:08,490
customization for example this airstrip

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,890
you could be with a fellow as option

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,990
could be configured and modified

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,350
dynamically even without a reboot of the

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,120
service so the resource model more to

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,460
the focus on standardization to deal

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,760
with the multi-window

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:26,130
interoperability for the second

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,460
challenge we have to make this model

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,430
allow again it should be based on code

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,280
and also test and verify in real

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,610
environment and set a criteria to accept

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,230
the modeling consensus based on some

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:46,080
code so this will bring the definite of

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,720
the friendship to developers Miki the

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,870
develop of more friendly that's it's a

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:57,210
simple and easy adapting so come to

00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,810
collaboration we think because the lack

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,530
of cross played from collaboration we

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,390
are sometimes the Univision is slow

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:10,650
under standard body also blamed as a

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,400
slow and the OSS open source is also too

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,590
technical

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,440
so the oblem each other so that's why we

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,290
have to bring business standard body

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,500
open source team autogas and as well was

00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,320
the beginning so we start focus on real

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,300
problem and the start and the build a

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,360
reference code for implementation based

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,330
on open source and as I stand added a

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,300
needy the base don't always stand at it

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,180
and finally back to business team with a

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,460
real trail and real protection this

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,860
closed loop iteration

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:49,370
speedups is in the will channel speed up

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:52,680
the business iteration and ecosystem

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,590
that is important to link the technology

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,170
platform to business the more partner

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,540
involved the more application the use

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,870
keys being leveraged the more relevant

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:08,490
we could bring the platform to digital

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,270
society but we are so used to build this

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,820
ecosystem

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,940
you know isolated away just as the way

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,630
each has a pond and backyard doesn't

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,460
mean we all can have a lake or ocean

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:23,220
unless it is can be connected in some

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,540
way so that's why we need to build the

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,960
Apple Store for the networking

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:31,530
infrastructure that's a global

00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,430
marketplace so this global marketplace

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,170
need to be extremely prosperous hundreds

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,100
of times or thousand times application

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:44,090
should be put there and also it should

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:48,090
be global access with a single release

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:51,120
and also the common process need to be

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,220
built to where fact and the base downs

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,830
are some edge it was to provide as a

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,880
high efficiency so these will share the

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:02,900
cost across the window and our Pretender

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,740
see with effort for the whole industry

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,630
so as a window

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,080
our vision is always engage on build

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:14,280
open business folks and healthy industry

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,440
platform so look around that's why we

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,170
fear Linux Foundation networking did a

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,230
good job and the big I will have a good

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,450
start it aggregated the community and

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,870
the crowd feed use these four aspects as

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,880
we expected

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:33,210
so that's why our choices in expanding

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,340
umbrella as a founder member but looking

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,970
forward missing steer something need the

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,460
forethought to be enhanced for example

00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:43,590
architecture we need a strong tag team

00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,950
to focus on hood this target

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:51,300
architecture and the tactical vision to

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:53,220
order this overlapping collaboration we

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,230
need a unified user case community to

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,250
make sure we are really

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:02,850
the valuables in error and the real

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,620
deployment are committed and modeling of

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,740
course we need to speed up collaborating

00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,500
with a standard body and echo system we

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,840
need a unified verification program to

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,710
lower the cost of certification the

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,950
interworking so we have to do this all

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,280
together

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:27,810
so to summarize my talk and into the

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,480
intent driven platform will be needed at

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,310
the same provided simplicity and to

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,100
unleash the power and efficiency for the

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,090
networking infrastructure no-one can

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,780
build it alone

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:42,870
we need an industry platform from these

00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,680
four aspects architecture modeling

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:49,860
collaboration and ecosystem that this

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,920
platform is ready can we wait for

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,100
somebody to build it this question has

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,010
Matt but we need more wisdoms and we

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,600
really need to make the happen together

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:03,720
so based on that I'm confident our

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,340
networking infrastructure would continue

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,410
to bring more value to the digital

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:12,990
society so stay with a game and the brim

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,680
it'll the network more relevant to a

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:21,059
better future so thank you for listening

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,059
