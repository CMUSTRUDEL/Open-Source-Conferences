00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,680
hello welcome back to day two

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,959
of the open networking and edge summit

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,079
what a fantastic start to the summit

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,920
um thank you all for uh the

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,120
positive feedback we have received in

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,000
fact we had participants from

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,279
72 countries and growing i mean some of

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,279
as you know most of

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,560
half of the world is sleeping at any

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,560
given time

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,839
but still they made it an effort to join

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,560
so very excited today

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,519
we have an amazing lineup of sessions

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,760
and keynotes

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,320
and you know a lot of things that have

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,279
really been the top of the conversation

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,040
today

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,720
what i want to call out before we jump

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,760
into our first keynote

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,959
is the um a session that

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,000
we have hosted specifically as

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:55,440
as a evening event uh

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,079
again relatively speaking evening

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
this is the mingle with the lf

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,279
networking

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
and lf edge boards everybody is free to

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,880
attend

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,480
ask questions no question is off limit

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,199
uh please join through the normal

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,560
channels

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,440
and let's see where that goes uh so with

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,320
that said

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,839
um and again by the way that's at 4 p.m

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,880
eastern standard so

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,240
just you know about you know

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,199
four hours from now anyway let me just

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
uh

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,160
briefly introduce our first keynote

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,279
speaker today

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,279
well-known industry thought leader he's

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,000
the senior vice president

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,959
of strategy and technology at deutsche

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
telekom

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,720
as we all know deutsche telekom is one

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
of the top

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,600
carriers globally they and their

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,199
associated partners

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,920
right work on everything from

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,639
orchestration to automation to edge to

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
rent

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,560
and you know provide a great deal of

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,440
community support

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,480
and leadership um what he's going to

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,680
talk about today

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,399
is how you know 5g 5g orchestration and

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,279
then how

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,079
edge specifically the edge cloud comes

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,639
in

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,880
with the theme of how you know

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,199
collaboration and co-operation

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,000
are the name of the game as we move to

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,480
the edge

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,440
so without any uh further ado please

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,540
welcome

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:29,890
alex choi

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:29,890
[Music]

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,650
[Music]

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,040
the edge computing potential for

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,279
operators is really huge

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,519
we see great potential when it comes to

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,839
consumer or business applications

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,720
because the devices that we're using be

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,759
it phones

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,880
or beat glasses in the future the cars

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,039
or drones they need to have a kind of

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,919
offload compute capabilities

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,120
and here the closest part to the devices

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,640
are the operators

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,160
and that's why we have a great

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
capabilities be it

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,880
managed latency very good throughput or

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,839
be it a law jitter

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,079
but very important is that we act as a

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,039
community we have to act fast as a

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,240
community

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,000
to make these capabilities available to

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,600
product partners in the enterprise

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,799
segment and the consumer business

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,840
the gsma telcox cloud tech is a global

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,919
platform solution

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,240
to expose manage and market edge

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,080
computing resources and capabilities

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,080
across different networks and national

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
boundaries based on a combination of

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,480
open technologies

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,360
and telco standards tech is the only

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,960
edge initiative targeting a global open

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,679
and federated solution

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,559
trials involving mnos customers and

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,200
ecosystem

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,799
partners are essential to explore

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,960
validate and further evolve

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,559
the telco edge cloud service this was

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
the driver behind

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,240
telefonica and deutsche telecom coming

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,200
together with mobile checks

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,360
to demonstrate telco it's cloud service

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,080
in this case the service was a latency

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,200
sensitivity

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,960
exactly spontaneously said okay my son

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,160
is a good gamer and i said okay my son

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,039
is a good gamer as well

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,840
why don't we play at our homes family

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,840
versus family

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,080
in this multi-operator mech deployment

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,160
we were both connected to edge nodes

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,000
cloudlets in germany and spain

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,280
respectively where the mobility x

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,520
platform was running

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,679
dt and telefonica provided the public

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,200
network connectivity between the user

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,919
devices and the respective

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
edge locations and as well as having fun

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,799
with xr

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,200
we were able to validate the value of

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,960
edge computing for a differentiated xr

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,640
gaming experience

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
was sitting across europe in different

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,679
locations and the latency

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,400
was so stable as if you were in a local

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,400
desktop environment

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,480
the telcos cloud will be open and

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
inclusive and will support existing

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,600
platforms like mobile checks to

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
accelerate the development

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,120
we will continue our collaboration with

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,160
further trials

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,880
as we build the telcos cloud in 2020. so

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,240
to me this is really a highlight and low

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,679
latency compute

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,240
capabilities from carriers are available

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,240
right now

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,280
good morning good afternoon good evening

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,120
depending on your location

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,080
my name is alex choi of deutsche telekom

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,440
today i would like to present you about

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,039
deutsche telekom's

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:08,400
approach to build an open and global

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,400
telco energy cloud in the age of 5g

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,240
the tech industry is changing rapidly

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,360
from traditional conventional structures

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,200
as we are facing significant changes on

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,720
all fronts

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,120
market wise nt and ig

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
used to be very completely separate

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,880
world

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,919
with a little to no overlap

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,200
now hyperscalers have a global scale

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,559
fiber connection

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,679
and data centers beyond the capabilities

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,720
of any single telco in the world

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,039
therefore we are facing

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,440
tight competitions as a result

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,240
many id technologies have been

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,440
introduced

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,320
into the nt domain to enhance and

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,600
optimize the existing processes

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,640
10 years ago we cannot imagine

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,760
this kind of changes

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,760
we are also experiencing changes in the

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,799
customer demand

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,200
consumers and enterprise customers are

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,240
now

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,280
expecting digital experiences

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,559
individualize the services which are

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,760
instantly provided and usable

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,960
and changeable

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,240
faced with such accelerated dynamics

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,280
the nt world has a struggle

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,640
to keep the pace after a series of

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,120
consolidations

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,159
we are left with only a handful of net

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,520
offenders

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,960
that stay in the comfort zone and resist

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,960
rapid innovations

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:55,280
we want to transform our infrastructure

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,559
to a new open distributed cloud-based

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,200
architecture

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,960
to become a software and data driven

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,799
telco

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,760
doing so will bring ntnit closure

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,559
together

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,000
with a holistic view on hardware and

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,440
software

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,640
our final goal is to implement

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,840
more agile flexible cost

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,960
efficient productions

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,440
we believe that such change will enable

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,400
us

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,760
to have a network optimized for time to

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,720
market

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,360
and how should we do this it will be

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,640
based on

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:38,240
cloud disaggregation orchestration

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,120
and open apis and the picture

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
is to transform our network towards a

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,080
simpler

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,799
and automated production model enabling

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,640
the quality of service delivery of 5g

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,679
enterprise services

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,559
to rear customer problems

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,200
we would like to disaggregate the excess

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,000
space

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,960
with the virtualizations we are

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,320
committed

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,360
to it through oran openram as we

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,720
introduce

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,159
new smaller vendors to accelerate

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:16,320
the road map of the entire ecosystem

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:19,120
including existing vendors orchestration

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,520
is critical since we have to deal with

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,840
more

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,679
complex domains after combination of

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,840
ntnit given the means of the end-to-end

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,640
base to manage the quality of service

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,320
requirements

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,679
in 5g the importance of automation and

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,600
orchestration

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:43,039
will only increase as multiple entities

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,159
have to be managed we believe that

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,360
open source will play a critical role

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,640
here

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,440
so at those telecom we are utilizing

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,000
onap

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,120
the open source-based network automation

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,799
platform

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:02,640
to develop a 5g and 10 orchestrator

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,679
for our network automations

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,440
open api enabling is an important

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,919
in two ways one in a sense that

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,960
we can import the innovation from

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,320
outside

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,679
to optimize our tco and enhance

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,320
our service and the other

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,440
in a sense that we can publish

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,440
innovations

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,240
built within telco to the outside

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
for example what used to be a taco

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
specific

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,200
network capabilities can now be

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,080
opened up to the third parties and

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,520
packaged

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,400
together with their services this will

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,880
create a new business model for telcos

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,880
that was not available before

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,760
now that i shared with you the vision of

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,279
network differentiations

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,279
let's record my earlier comments

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:04,480
about new competitions from hyperscalers

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,760
and the new better grounds

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,120
here is a swot analysis which helps

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,760
in order to observe and understand

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,279
what control points the hyperscalers

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,320
currently occupy

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,880
and what they are targeting to occupy in

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,880
the future

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:27,200
and likewise for the telcos

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,000
so what are their control points today

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,799
for otgs or hyperscalers

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,799
as you can see in this slide they

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,840
dominate the device platform

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:41,440
for virtual connectivity in ip

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,039
and above layer protocols the global

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,480
scale public cloud and most notably

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,600
the developer community it was the

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,039
hyperscalers

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,400
who created the apps stores that have

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,440
become the life

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,799
blood for the developer community to

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,000
deliver their apps

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:05,039
and services these are the

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,480
key strengths of the hyperscalers

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,440
whereas looking at the strengths

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,320
of the telco community we have the sim

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
card

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
which continues to be an important

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,720
customer touch point

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,919
and of course we dominate the access

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,360
network

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,240
core network and peering

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,120
last but not least the physical layer

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,919
the underlay

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,600
i call it ip minus layer here including

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,000
mpls

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,840
so what's the new battery ground where

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,240
the new opportunities

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,080
exist hyperscalers movements

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,279
as worn out by microsoft amazon

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:51,360
google's recent strategic play

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:54,080
is to look left in this picture

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,279
in the direction of on-premise edge

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,400
telco edge

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,799
and network core focusing specifically

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,559
on

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:06,080
investment on improve the end users

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:09,440
customer experience whereas

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,400
looking at the lower part in this

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,640
diagram

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,200
turquoise movement is to look right

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,399
focusing on building the taco edge and

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,000
cultivating

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,720
partnership with developers obviously

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
the biggest control point for techcos

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,520
are 5g

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,840
network apis network slicing provided

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:36,320
in a cloud native style telco lg

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:41,120
cloud having said let's deep dive into

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,120
techco edge cloud in the following slide

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,000
cloud used to sit at the data center

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:53,520
far away from customers

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,720
but edgy cloud moves it very near to

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,440
customers

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,600
which brings multiple benefits like a

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,880
reduced rate latency

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,640
location awareness security enhancement

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,600
and tco optimizations we believe that

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,799
anti-cloud

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,279
is a key control point for telcos to

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,799
create

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,600
a new greenfield marketplace business

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,080
models

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,120
for turquoise used to be connectivity

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,559
and ios

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,919
but edge enables new services and new

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,200
business models

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,520
for example around sla-based

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,880
real-time mission critical application

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,279
and services

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,919
for verticals other players can also

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,880
provide the similar services

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,919
but we believe tackles are the best

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,640
positions

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,640
due to the proximity to the customer

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:54,640
edgy is a game of scale however

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,640
so to stay in the game operators must

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,919
maximize scale with the multi-operator

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,120
and multi-cloud approach

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,039
the reason why operators lost cloud

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,559
market to hyperscalers

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,840
is that we were divided developers

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,960
wanted to a

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,000
single interface preferably

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,520
standardized api based across all

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,559
markets

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,120
so they went to hyperscalers that can

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,760
provide

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:30,960
scalability in the telco educates

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,799
scale is defined by two criteria as

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,080
shown in this slide

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:39,360
that virtually reinforce each other

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,720
first geographical or operator

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,840
reach developers need a market

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,320
at global scale and like to build on

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,320
same programming environment they

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,520
already know

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,960
the more operators provide the same apis

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,000
to the developers

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,240
the more customers can be reached by

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,520
developers via this platform

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,200
secondly a rich application and

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,960
device offering consumers

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,919
and enterprise customers expect a rich

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,039
and wide offering of application and

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,559
devices

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:24,320
for edge the operator community

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:27,440
can influence and push both effects

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,880
by collaborating to broaden

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,000
geographical and operator reach

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,720
and provide access to a larger customer

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,760
base

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,440
and support the needs of multinational

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,919
enterprise customers in other words

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,679
we need to create an open and global

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,279
telco edge cloud

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,480
which federates of course operators

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,760
and cloud stacks meaning it should be

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,720
multi-operator

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
and multi-cloud

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,840
if we can create this then eventually

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,640
edge applications and devices will work

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,640
universally

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,600
but the edge train is not waiting at the

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,880
station

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,960
as edgy becomes a commercial reality

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,159
and more players compete in the space

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,200
the operators community needs to act

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,640
fast to stake a claim

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,720
in the edge value chain by capitalizing

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,480
on its monetizable assets like a managed

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:40,720
quality of connectivity network apis

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:43,679
and proximity to customers

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,240
at deutsche telekom we are building the

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,279
telco

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,960
edge with a multiple turquoise

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,080
through the gsma as well as hyperscalers

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,120
to deliver standard-based partnership

00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,640
on edge computing

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,600
mobile ajax a new startup gt

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,640
founded two years ago in bay area for

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,080
the development

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,200
of the multi-cloud edu pass software

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,559
is our first approach toward such

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,360
delivery

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,320
with multiple parties joining us as

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,640
shareholders

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,760
to make it work as presented to you

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,799
in my opening video we recently

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,679
completed the first techoetic cloud

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,720
trial involving telefonica and those

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,760
telecom

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,480
with mobile objects around a latency

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,559
sensitive

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,519
ar game with impressive results

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,720
and we are now preparing a further trial

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,760
with partners

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,960
in the b2b space

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,480
to conclude i sincerely urge

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,279
the techo community act fast and all

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,559
together

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,200
through industry form like o m

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
to capture the new opportunities and

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,320
create

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,960
new revenue stream while innovating

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:11,840
consumer experience

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,840
thank you for your attention

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,000
thank you alex uh that was very

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,799
insightful and

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,480
and you know appreciate the video uh in

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,480
the introductory video that was pretty

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,880
cool

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:32,320
i also want to sort of emphasize that

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,600
we just in talks in terms of api uh we

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,640
we did uh release from an lf edge

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,519
perspective

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,559
and a api white paper that kind of goes

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,200
into details

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,640
of what work has been done so far on the

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,200
public cloud interface

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,720
public cloud telco edge interface you

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,640
know whether it's the pass api or

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
resource management or things like that

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,760
so

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,919
all good work and again from a

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,240
terminology perspective edge cloud

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,200
service provider cloud sort of is is

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,600
what is

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,360
shared and offered as a service so

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,240
really exciting work going on

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,360
at deutsche telekom uh you know beyond

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,560
the orchestration

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,800
uh and and open source support so

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,000
with that said continuing with the theme

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,679
of edge

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,200
uh our next uh keynote is one of

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,159
uh you know very prominent supporters

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,879
of uh open source uh i know it's a

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,320
little late

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:31,679
uh in in china but uh we have bill ren

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,399
from huawei who's the chief open source

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,800
liaison

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,760
officer he has been a very active

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,240
contributor

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,639
to the open source community to open

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,760
networking and edge summit historically

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,280
a great visionary moving

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,879
china and pretty much their entire

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,480
uh ecosystem forward so today he will be

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,599
obviously talking about

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,240
5g and mech specifically continuing with

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
our edge

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:03,680
theme today so without any uh

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,680
further ado please welcome bellring

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,240
this is bill from huawei i'm in charge

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,119
of the ict infrastructure

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,040
open source business and i'm very glad

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,560
to hear to share my thoughts about

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,760
the open source

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,599
my presentation is unleashing the power

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,000
for 5g me c through open source

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,320
collaboration

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,480
so here is a i will talk in three parts

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,800
first i will talk why we need this new

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,560
relation for production second is

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,839
what exactly what we are means this new

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,200
relation of production

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:53,040
for edge computing and how finally

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:57,040
to achieve this okay so

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,000
let's see this unleashing the power of

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,440
the industry from

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,480
different times first

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,240
in the farming 8000 years ago the cattle

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,839
was domesticated

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,680
and but only two it's only until 2000

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,000
years ago filmmans can

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,119
started to utilize cattle to close the

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,440
fields

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,800
and until at that time the efficiency of

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,960
human production

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,960
was improved dozens of times

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:32,480
and also similar in the 1979

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:36,160
the first steam engine mode was invented

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,359
already but it's only until 1769

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,880
when what improved the steam engine

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:46,640
it used in the factory then

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,599
it's it's also the

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,720
productivity force of steam engine was

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,400
unleashed

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,760
and the human society is from new horse

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,800
workshop

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:02,560
transformed to the fracture and industry

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,920
times so

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,599
today the 5g area is coming the family

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,960
network was constructed and

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,560
deployed all over the world so we have

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,680
reason to believe

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:20,480
if we need to unleash the power of

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,480
algae we also need some new religion for

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,440
production which

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:30,320
could make those industry

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,320
industry change from network ecosystem

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:40,079
here is a transform in diagram just

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,359
to illustrate how our

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,000
tech industry is transforming from

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,040
the traditional communication times to

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,079
the digital

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:54,880
times and as well as to the next

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:58,160
intelligent terms we can see the

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,359
the different stack of this uh business

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,480
from what coin integration from telecom

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,440
based

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,200
to the middle internet-based networking

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,800
service is decoupled

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:15,520
and we support the diversity service

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,520
based on this pipeline network

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
we can see this structural value

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,440
transform

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,640
is avoided and the value of this pipe

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,000
is shared this industry value is

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,119
is keep on reducing but how can we

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,320
cut with this new growth of a telco

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,800
pipeline and

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,079
grab these growth opportunities on the

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,359
network side

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:48,079
we believe the edge computing gave us a

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,079
possible and feasible way to do it

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,520
but look at back in the past

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,000
several years in our telecom industry we

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,280
also

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,200
built so many developer activities

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,200
such as developer contest

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,280
and developer campaign training camp

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,359
campaign

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:14,480
and we also do a lot of joint animations

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:18,079
but the industry

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,960
approach to this is not so effective

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,119
based on the opinions from different

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,680
staff like marketing present

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,320
person or technical person some of them

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,280
are very

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,839
optimistic they think we have enough

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,680
budget

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:36,480
we should do more innovation things

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,160
and some of our are pessimistic they

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,599
think

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,640
we lack our talent

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,800
to do this program shift

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:52,000
is very difficult just like uh

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,320
what we're doing in the sense is

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,440
because we we didn't have a unified

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,560
platform so this

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,200
innovation achievement in our industries

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,040
is not very high effective just like we

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,359
built this sandcastle in the

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,480
sea beach and we didn't have a closer

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,000
look

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,520
also to business so the the project

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,280
that we build is difficult to replicate

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,760
there's no drought for this innovation

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,319
the industries started

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,839
for the innovation when when we talk

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,760
about the intervention some someone got

00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,280
frustrated so how can we solve these

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,240
things

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,119
some some of people think the difficult

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,480
thing is

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,079
is from is for universities

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:41,520
for from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 10

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,800
but for us based on the experience

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,960
in the past decade there is never

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,839
lack of innovation in our industry the

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,800
most difficult

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,359
thing for us is to how to replicate

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,359
those

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:59,040
innovations from 10 to 100

00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:03,359
or even to tens of thousands

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,359
so this is a difficult time to do

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,640
here i'd like to show another

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,920
talk from from the famous

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,800
business leaders like the jack ma who is

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,839
the chairman

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,400
of alibaba who gave a talk in

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,400
2017 not

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,839
religion for available

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,200
he talked if you don't see the internet

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,319
as production

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,319
more and more problems will arise

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:50,400
as the internet should not exist only

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,079
in internet companies instead the

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,760
internet across all

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,880
society similarly we believe for edge

00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,240
computing

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:04,000
is also empowers the society

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:07,440
it's not only the for the

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,560
carriers it's for every industry

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,040
so how to find the best way to utilize

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,240
and

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,280
maximize the value of value and user

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,560
capability of

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,240
edge computing is needed a productive

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:25,520
force for new relational production

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:30,000
because here we have basic underlying

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,599
logic is it the combination for vendors

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,720
and the carriers and

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:37,680
the industry partners they should

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,640
ask themselves what's our value

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,280
proposition

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,680
in the industry in the society and what

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,800
kind of

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,319
value we could create for this descent

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,240
so that's the thing we we wanted to see

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,280
they need to build a new relational

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,280
production together

00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:01,119
so here is is my definition of this new

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,359
religion production based on open source

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,480
we want to cope building this platform

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,920
and share the ecosystem together

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,520
it's a four things for this new first is

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,200
a new collaboration

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,640
we need to jointly define this

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,920
communicate

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,400
in the community and the verifies is

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,000
thinking and exploring all the

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,640
innovations together

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,760
based on open source code with the cross

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,720
domain

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,960
with full lifecycle streaming learning

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,240
and from protocols to interaction

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,760
interface alive

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,880
and second is for new development

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,119
we should not only let the ict

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,160
industry have developers to do the

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,880
things

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,000
we also need to enable those different

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,000
industries

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,880
for their users developers to develop

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,880
5g applications as quick as possible as

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,200
cost effective as possible

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,480
we need the loads of barriers for for

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,160
entrance

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,720
we need to provide the capability for

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,599
online development and verification

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,640
we need the priorities to build their

00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,240
habit

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,839
and make them to reuse

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,839
atomic capabilities easily

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,480
the third one is the new x system we

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:23,200
need a shared

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,040
industry application ecosystem together

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,319
with a unified market

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,640
and shared those applications and

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,920
those identification integration

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,599
verification

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,480
together this last one is a new

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,079
transaction

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,880
we should also build a community based

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,000
application repository to enable this

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,880
transaction

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,240
from single transaction to multi-lateral

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,560
multi-times

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,560
from single supply to mutual supply

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,680
here i will talk one by one first new

00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,800
collaboration

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,079
you can see as we used to put effort in

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,880
different

00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,920
direction with the different

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,520
stakeholders

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:13,119
like application developers oss vendors

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,760
carriers device vendors so

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,480
based on this joint platform and the

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,440
jointer

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,240
open source together we could be

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,400
controlled

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:28,160
since based on com consensus

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,800
from business level and to the operation

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,760
level

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,880
and as well as this platform even with a

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,079
technical stack

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,880
we should unify it and

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,200
finally the deployment we all need the

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,040
consensus

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:48,400
because this mutual trust and the

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,319
cost is very high second

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,680
for the new development you can see

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:58,800
the develops in in gt is three million

00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:03,280
and it's even ten times bigger

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,920
in github and also the open source

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,240
software it was used in 99 percent of

00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,400
commercial software so there is no

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,960
uh developers coder code

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,720
not far away from open source so it's so

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,720
diversified

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:24,000
second quickly how can we quickly

00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,720
let the other industry developers

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,359
get familiar with these different

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,760
industries

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,520
and how to easily get started with

00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,720
faculty capabilities

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,680
and how can we make those rich

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,119
autonomic capabilities it could be

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,160
easily transformed

00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,040
abstract convert to industry number four

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,800
into

00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:50,400
industry solutions and the third one

00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,599
how can we help to leverage those

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,599
cross organization sharing based on the

00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,079
best scenario best architecture and the

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,280
best

00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,920
practice and

00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,760
of course finally this open source

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,119
platform couldn't

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,760
help these developers to save their

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,599
time and coding and device investment

00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,160
makes the development more cost

00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,160
effective

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:25,839
and the new ecosystem

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,839
so we can say this new ecosystem

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,400
we need to build this industry

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,319
application

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,240
system with a new unified market and

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:38,079
share the application

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:41,280
we use to help ecosystem in our industry

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,520
but it it is small scale

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,559
just like pets it's difficult to

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,800
replicate

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,480
these scenarios because it's a

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,319
fragmented market

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,559
so and the efficiency also is also

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,640
is very low it's mute manually

00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:00,400
integrated and focus on few

00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,359
scenarios and the number is hundreds

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,000
but we we do need something like this

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,800
the

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,839
right side diagram shows this world

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,040
beast

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,400
it's more healthy more self-growth more

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,839
diversified

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:18,720
and it should be easily

00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,800
evolved to millions of applications

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,640
which this unified integration unified

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,640
verification unified market

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,960
and this new transaction is also easy to

00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,079
understand

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,480
used we have this long chain

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,839
with very limited and a single time

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,839
transaction

00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,440
and it's upstream and the downstream

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:44,559
relationship point to point

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,559
when we supply but we need

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,480
based on this uh communicate application

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,480
repository to feed

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,599
different device vendors carriers

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,559
vertical industries all together

00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,440
build this new transaction mode with

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,079
unlimited

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,040
short chain and multi-time transaction

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,800
many-to-many

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:10,319
new mutual supply and mutual enhancement

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,400
relationship and this community-based

00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,760
pre-integration and shared application

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,559
system will

00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,559
will help the business grows more fast

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,760
so that's the new

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,960
religion of production what we talk so

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,400
that's also why this edge gallery open

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,280
source community

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,400
exists our wish is to build a

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,040
collaborative

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,400
and win-win relations production on this

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,079
edge computing

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,480
industry so our position is to build

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,800
this defective standard based on what

00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,960
edge computing architecture and enable

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,520
openings in the target field

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,480
and lower the threshold and the barrier

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,359
for bring

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,440
interpret application on board and form

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,760
a large scale and the build of

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,200
business-to-business ecosystem more

00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,960
easily

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:10,240
and basically our value proposition is a

00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,640
value native connection capability edge

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:16,319
native architecture and the diversified

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,599
and open access team just like this page

00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,480
shows

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,960
this is our value proposition and the

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,200
first

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,839
filternative connection we will make

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,559
this valid equivalent

00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:31,839
accessible everywhere easily we will

00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:34,400
make sure this communication community

00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,359
provides this interconnected with the

00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,800
latest

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:41,200
alive 5g network elements

00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,040
as easy as possible and it will be

00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,160
compliant to the latest

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,960
ets standards and make use of

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,359
the high performance data plan and the

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,000
value-added network capabilities

00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,800
of course based on cloud native

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,599
capabilities

00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,839
we do think there's a need for the edge

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,839
native architecture because

00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,040
in the edges the results are more

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,800
limited we should

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,800
have this lightweight resource

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,960
management capabilities

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,559
we should have this four stack security

00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,440
mechanism we also showed how this

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,440
reliable management and our operation

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,440
capability be available

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,480
and the third one is we need this

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,359
diversity and

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,040
open access team make the application

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,359
developers

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,880
more easily to develop and make make

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,920
sure the application

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,559
and bond more easily and replicate

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,760
more easily so that simplifies the

00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,040
development

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,440
and the convenient this verification

00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,559
and the unified application portals as

00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,440
well as this

00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:51,119
share resist ecosystem with uh with this

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:55,280
marketing place

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,280
and here is our architecture

00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,800
basically it which has this application

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:06,240
edge platform is a key

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:09,280
in the right hand side based on this

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,920
api gateway based on this local

00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,559
openness capabilities for network as

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,359
well as

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,800
this data plan and of course in the

00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,920
middle there is a management

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:23,440
plan for obstruction and application

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,040
and distribution report repository

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,480
capability as well

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:31,760
in the left side and finally

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:35,680
this for developers we need you very

00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:39,440
user-friendly developer

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:46,720
environment under the bottom is a

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:50,800
basic technical stack

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:53,839
and in the past seven months

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,040
in this edge gallery community we have

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:59,680
almo almost more than 30 applications

00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,640
cover the different scenarios like smart

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,119
camps

00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,400
industry manufacturer transportation the

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,359
logistics and the

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,359
competitive gaming

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,680
and another thing interesting thing for

00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,319
the edge gallery open source community

00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,079
is

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:21,359
besides this community

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:26,640
of a source code of a wiki of

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:26,640
document we also provide this very

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,200
comprehensive laboratory infrastructure

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,920
for for the partners for the developers

00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,400
to

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,319
to verify to develop their applications

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,079
because 5g

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:46,000
infrastructure and network is quite

00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,040
costly for the normal developers for the

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,559
small

00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:54,000
business developers to

00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,559
to afford so the value to communities

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
is we pride this live file entrance

00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,240
verification environment

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,280
we practice this automatic integration

00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,680
and platform

00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,920
and the test results can be easily

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,960
applied for any time

00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,800
and we expect the value

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,800
for this laboratory in the future we

00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,160
could publish more white paper

00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:19,280
more test report more test

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,319
industry index for for guiding this

00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,359
industry

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:26,720
to move forward to the

00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:32,160
business to uh enabling the business

00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:35,520
uh more prosperous

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,799
okay so for edge gallery

00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,280
collaboration with the industry

00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:43,600
organization is of course is very

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,920
very needed so we we have a very

00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,400
[Music]

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,680
good relationship with linux foundation

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,720
edge community

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:56,000
and one of the blueprint

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,920
in the acronym releases three which

00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,240
which is provided by

00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,119
channel mobile by tencent and the valve

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,119
together

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,599
of course we also complied with the ets

00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,319
standards we also we need to cooperate

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,680
with

00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:12,480
gsma open platform and some others

00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,440
like a fellow gta association at

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,480
computing

00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:21,839
association and the industry

00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,839
interconnection association as well

00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,359
so for edge gallery expectation i think

00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,440
this

00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,400
year is of course we need more

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,000
diversified

00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:35,040
developers more diversified governance

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,480
structures more active developers more

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,440
applications

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,839
more live infrastructures to enabling

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,280
more

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:47,119
i.t plasticity while added service

00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:50,799
and in the future we think

00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:53,839
the communication partners we need

00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:57,040
this platform to

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,760
more help for our developers to do more

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,000
research

00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,240
for the edge computing area

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,240
for

00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,000
so it's a right time to build this

00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:12,480
industry platform together let's embrace

00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,079
and for this explosive growth for the

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,200
federal gmec

00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:20,559
market you can say

00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,839
here i provide this uh

00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:26,880
for for you to to access for our website

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:30,079
for our community for our

00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:33,440
uh wiki and the chat group

00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:36,799
so i wish all

00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:41,119
us can can work together to

00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:45,839
make sure we have a better future

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,839

midnight uh for this uh again you know

00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,640
the

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,480
advantage of this is your jet lag but

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:06,079
not after a 20-hour flight so

00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,400
thank you um i also love the concepts

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,680
of kind of bringing out the relationship

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,960
between

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,960
sort of the industries and the various

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,839
organizations within

00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,359
an end user or a telecom provider so

00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:22,480
love the concept and you know

00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:24,640
great example of a vendor stepping up

00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,760
utilizing open source technologies but

00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,720
more importantly

00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,480
building on tap to drive innovation

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,280
forward so really excited thank you very

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,880

00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,520
is is uh on the other side of the world

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,720
obviously one of the top leaders in

00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,760
telecom

00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:47,680
i.t networking you name it

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,680
but it's from ibm

00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,040
and now marisa needs no introduction but

00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,760
she's the

00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,240
vice president of strategy and offerings

00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,799

00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,040
ibm they have the telecom media and

00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:02,720
entertainment group

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,520
she's spearheading a lot of the 5g

00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,640
a lot of edge and a lot of ecosystem

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,240
development

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,319
and uh she's going to pull it all

00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,559
together in terms of an end-to-end

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,680
uh telecom network what's needed what's

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,760
the challenges

00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,799
uh and you're starting to see a theme

00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,640
here on

00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:23,680
on how uh vendors are stepping up beyond

00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,240
uh the classic you know i contributed a

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,960
spec

00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,760
in a code or or something like that so

00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,319
without any

00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:33,280
uh further review uh please welcome

00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,280
marissa from

00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:41,030
ibm

00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:41,030
[Music]

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,520
how are telcos delivering on the promise

00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:49,359
of speed

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:51,599
and reliability when it matters most

00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,760
service providers are leveraging new

00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,319
open cloud-based solutions

00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,200
the same solutions that will enable edge

00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:00,880
computing

00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,040
and pave the way for 5g

00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,760
they're answering a global need for

00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,599
connection to essential resources

00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,799
from first responders and field

00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,839

00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,079
working infrastructure

00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,920
telecom companies are moving to operate

00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,480
as a platform business

00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,839
expanding their role as both digital

00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,359
service providers

00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:33,920
and digital service enablers

00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:36,799
by tapping into the combined capability

00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,040
of ibm and red hat's hybrid cloud

00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,920
telcos can more rapidly develop new

00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,920
services

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,760
and deploy them wherever they need to

00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,400
run

00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,839
telecommunication companies are making

00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,480
the technology decisions

00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,119
and investments to be the platform

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,760
provider

00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,480
or innovation catalyst at the extent to

00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,280
which

00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,920
they can innovate with the ecosystem to

00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,079
provide

00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,880

01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:05,040
businesses and individuals can consume

01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,079
that is where the magic happens within

01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,119
the industry

01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:11,040

partners

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,359
are innovating with clients to modernize

01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:33,119
the networks i will share with you

01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:36,240
some guiding principles technologies

01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,720
and ecosystem as well as

01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,400
recent implementations which are already

01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,520
in production

01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,400
at the core of this development open

01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,720
source

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:52,079
is playing a key role let's begin now

01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,160
with understanding of what ibm brings to

01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,760
operators today

01:00:54,160 --> 01:01:00,960
our goal is to improve business outcomes

01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:04,319
and we do that by focusing on three key

01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:07,040
imperatives digital engagement

01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:09,440
networking platforms and enterprise

01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,640
transformation

01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:16,160
in digital engagement we're very focused

01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:18,559
on bringing ibm watson to help

01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,839
in all of the interactions that our

01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,040
clients have

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:26,799
with their subscribers whether it is

01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:30,079
customer care asian assist

01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:32,079
or interactions in marketing demand

01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:35,839
generations

01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:39,119
ordering processes and others using

01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:41,440
data architectures and ai

01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,480
and not in machine learning to those

01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,520
processes

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,079
in order to make them most efficient and

01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,839
most

01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:52,079
contemporary in network and platform

01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,040
we are very focused on and we have a

01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:57,359
history

01:01:53,040 --> 01:02:00,400
of applying operations in the network

01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:02,319
with our netcool technology and

01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,599
other algorithms that we have applied

01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:06,640
throughout time

01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,359
with many of our clients operating the

01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,839
network

01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,920
as well as bringing our services

01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:14,960
capabilities and experience

01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,760
that allow clients to really modernize

01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,039
the network operations centers we're

01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,119
very focused on

01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,079
network modernization and that will be

01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,640
at the core

01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,160
of what i'll be sharing with you today

01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,200
modernizing those networks

01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,160
leveraging the heart and leveraging a

01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,359
number of other

01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:37,599
partners in that endeavor

01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:41,119
in enterprise transformation focus on

01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,839
modernizing hr processes

01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,880
supply chain management and many other

01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:47,920
processes

01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,559
that are at the core of how companies

01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,359
can't

01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,039
perform in a much better and effective

01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:56,319
manner

01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:57,520
so let's now dive into some guiding

01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:00,400
principles

01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,520
that we live are essential in order to

01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,880
modernize

01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:06,240
and to realize a modern network we start

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,280
with

01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:12,000
open architectures open architectures

01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,039
that will allow us to move from an

01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,559
appliance-based

01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:19,599
systems into a more software

01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,480
integration architecture we believe that

01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,400
here

01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,000
we need to leverage the open source

01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,520
community

01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,559
the upstream scale and provide the

01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,200
singular

01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,240
virtual infrastructure manager that of

01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,880
course for us

01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,760
will be based on openstack and red hat

01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,480
openstack

01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,520
or red hat open shift as we move into

01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,960
containerized

01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:46,720
network functions of course within

01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:49,520
this domain there will be new skills

01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,640
that we need to bring to bear c icd

01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,680
practices

01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,520
uh devos practices agile methodologies

01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,359
all of those methodologies develop in

01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,880
the id world that now

01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:02,880
are transferring into the telco domain

01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,319
in much simpler ways giving the

01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,400
experience that we have

01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:09,760
in the it area industry standards

01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,520
industry standards where we're

01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:16,480
leveraging etsy and the five plus years

01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:18,160
that are in etsy working in defining the

01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,200
network function vitalization

01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:23,200
specs uh along with probably many of you

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,520
participating in that

01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,799
3gpp that has been at the core of

01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,880
developing

01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:34,400
5g and the new networks that we will see

01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:37,680
in the future along with edge computing

01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,520
adopting industry standards we believe

01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,640
that that will guarantee

01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,480
that the interoperability the apis and

01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,440
the open interfaces

01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,559
that our clients need in order to move

01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,599
into a more

01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,960
modernized and reliable network

01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,000
infrastructure

01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,839
the third area is extreme automation and

01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,400
security

01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,960
extreme automation from the point of

01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,520
view

01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,799
of life cycle management of

01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,440
orchestration

01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,160
and assurance that all of these in the

01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,280
collective

01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,640
manner will now play a key role when it

01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,440
comes to

01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,880
day zero day one or day two of an

01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,680
operation

01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,280
allowing to guarantee the real-time

01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,400
optimization

01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:27,280
and bringing not the ecosystem

01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,200
within that and making that you know

01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:33,119
much more of a reality

01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:36,480
lastly deliver total cost of ownership

01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:39,440
with agility creating and realizing

01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,880
new value by having these common

01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,319
infrastructures

01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:47,039
but also by allowing to have new

01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,760
enterprise services that our clients can

01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,880
use

01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,000
in order to create a new revenue stream

01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:57,039
so the code is modernized in the network

01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,760
for consumers for new services

01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:01,119
video and others but also creating new

01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,200
services

01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,039
for enterprises such that

01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,920
telecommunication companies

01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,440
are more relevant to the enterprise can

01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,799
bring higher value

01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:16,960
as as enterprises move into industry for

01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:20,480
4.0 technology-oriented solutions

01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:23,359
creating a modern telecom network

01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,480
we believe that it requires the same

01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,520
platform

01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:31,280
at the core of the network and we ran

01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,359
and at the edge to ease management

01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,960
of the infrastructure and the

01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:38,000
applications

01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,280
in addition the growing number of smart

01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
devices

01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,240
the need for faster processing and

01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,880
increased pressure on the networks

01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,240
is driving the adoption of a more

01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,760
comprehensive

01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:55,039
architecture that supports devices

01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:58,720
and extends the cloud to the edge

01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:01,920
providing decentralized processing power

01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,640
distributed cloud and offline

01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,920
reliability

01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:12,000
early this year ibm announced

01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,559
ibm cloud satellite as the beta program

01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,240
ibm cloud satellite allow us to do some

01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,520
of those

01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,640
areas that i mentioned before enables

01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,359
users to manage applications across

01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,599
public

01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:27,119
and private environments with the

01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:30,640
synchro

01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:32,400
pane or class allowing for flexibility

01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,039
of the infrastructure

01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,640
as a service operations secure

01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,000
connectivity

01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:43,280
and application lifecycle management

01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,720
with ibm satellite users can get

01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:49,920
the ibm cloud catalog

01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:53,599
including manage openshift

01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:56,799
data and devops and much more

01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:59,920
all in the user's own data center

01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:03,599
with full sre operations

01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,480
in this case users do not need to be

01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,839
experts

01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:10,400
in running cloud environments or cloud

01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:14,160
services

01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:17,359
automation is also an important piece

01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,159
of this puzzle automating and operating

01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,520
services

01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:22,839
at the scale at the lower class and with

01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,159
full

01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:29,120
predictability onboarding

01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,640
vnfs onboarding cnfs in the future as we

01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:33,839
just become available

01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:37,040
in automating with the syndrome cicd

01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:38,000
lifecycle design and test stereotouch

01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,480
provisioning

01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,440
and network slicing becomes critical to

01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,960
deliver

01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:47,440
zero one services and when it comes to

01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,199
now the ongoing operations change

01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,839
management

01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,719
closed loop operations anomaly

01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,480
detections

01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,759
in the normal in an automated

01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,799
remediation

01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:01,600
is key to have the single

01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,799
automation across the designs the

01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,839
implementation

01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:07,679
as well as the operation of the network

01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:11,359
so we have been very focused

01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:14,319
on aligning with on-app and other key

01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,440
developments in the industry in adopting

01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,920
automation

01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,799
and creating software as well support

01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,679
the software

01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:23,440
as well as services that allow us to

01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:27,359
implement that

01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:30,400
now the ecosystem it is critical

01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:33,159
and fundamental to the telecom industry

01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:36,080
and by the way to many other industries

01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:37,279
pre-integrated pre-tested solutions are

01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,719
the desire

01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:42,400
of every company that that's the only

01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:45,759
way that we can accelerate

01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,319
down to market therefore ibm has been

01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:51,359
building

01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:55,360
an ecosystem at all layers of the stack

01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:58,400
and so we are inviting companies

01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:01,440
to that are not currently present in

01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,920
in this slide to join us

01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,280
in certifying their software on

01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,719
openshift

01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:11,360
certifying their software on ibm

01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:13,360
cloud and becoming part of the catalog

01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,000
that we offer to manifest clients

01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,040
in the catalog that we use in order to

01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,159
build

01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:24,159
new services for our clients

01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:27,120
lastly open source for decades

01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:28,800
ibm has been partnering with linux

01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,360
foundation

01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,320
to advance open source software in the

01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,600
whole industry

01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:38,000
uh in general the network domain

01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,719
is no different and in fact we have

01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,360
joined

01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:46,080
opnf in in 2014 we continue with onap

01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,920
which translated then the umbrella uh

01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:50,480
linus foundation networking

01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,239
key members of that leading some of the

01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,040
activities there

01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:57,120
and most recently recognized the

01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:01,440
interests of our clients

01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:04,719
on tip which is primarily an operator

01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,920
operators led activity joining some of

01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,679
the working group theirs

01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,040
in doing some of the implementation in

01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,560
our labs

01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:16,080
and obviously also recently joined

01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:18,880
the oran alliance recognizing

01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,719
that the last part of the network that

01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,960
will be virtualized

01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:25,440
is the radio is the access layer so the

01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:28,320
radio access network will be virtualized

01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,360
and in fact many of our partners are in

01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,320
in the

01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:35,440
in the past already of implementing that

01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:38,400
and making that a reality

01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,199
we will now go into some of the examples

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,880
that we

01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:46,080
are seeing and delivering

01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,800
in production within the industry the

01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,080
open

01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,120
universal hybrid cloud is a hybrid cloud

01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,760
platform

01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,520
that is based on open technology and

01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:59,040
open standards

01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:02,880
from ibm and from jihad along with 14

01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:06,840
other partners it enables vodafone idea

01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:10,080
to better serve nearly 300 million

01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:13,440
subscribers by simplifying

01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:16,640
and transforming its id

01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:20,000
in telecom network operation

01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:22,800
the new platform is deployed across many

01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,159
distributed vodafone idea cloud

01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,520
microsite

01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:28,400
across india as well as the centrality

01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,840
operations

01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:34,719
which today are also run by ibm

01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,520
some of the benefits that visha and voda

01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:38,800
the cto

01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:42,159
of vodafone idea is getting is

01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:45,440
he claims 85 reductions

01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:49,120
in capex 50 reduction

01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:52,159
in opex and 90 reduce

01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:55,360
cost of production of the goods

01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:57,679
you know this is just one example that

01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,560
is getting you know more and more

01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,920
visibility

01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,040
within the market with over 400 million

01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,000
subscribers

01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:07,040
and increase market pressure bharti

01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,880
airtel

01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:13,920
has the vision of building a common

01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:17,199
infrastructure with carrier grade

01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,199
them with having automation and a

01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:23,040
partner ecosystem

01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:24,880
functions like virtual ims visual apc

01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,199
and many other of the components that

01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,760
needs to be to build a network

01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:31,600
is getting implemented here now in

01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,719
production

01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:38,560
ibm role within this particular

01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:42,800
scenario has been as a system integrator

01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:45,440
ibm innovation in building automation

01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,920
uh and methodologies that allow us to

01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:51,440
increase our automation

01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:54,800
reduce our cost and in time to

01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,880
introduce time to deploying we are very

01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,520
proud of these two examples

01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,000
because it represents something that it

01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,560
has been

01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,199
worked and said in the industry and now

01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,760
is being

01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:06,800
implemented and deployed in production

01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,840
so very

01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:12,880
proud to serve more than over

01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:16,000
700 billion subscribers with these

01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,920
solutions what takes me to the next

01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,199
example

01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:24,400
technologies like 5g nh

01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:28,000
are poised to play a huge role

01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:31,199
in building the future of virtually

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,040
every single industry enhanced by

01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:35,280
artificial intelligence

01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,960
these technologies promise to deliver

01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,920
low latency

01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:42,480
high performance computing and the

01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,679
service and the security requirements

01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,080
that many in the indus need in order to

01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,920
stay

01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:52,960
competitive the italian government

01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,480
sponsor operators in a number of cities

01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,800
across the country to deploy 5g

01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,239
and it's also partnering with more than

01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,000
100 companies

01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:05,440
in order to build services and

01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,400
applications that their citizens can use

01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:10,960
in this case we have worked with

01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:14,480
vodafone italy our role

01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:17,760
has been in building specific use cases

01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:21,600
and services that citizens can use

01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:24,400
among those are safety and surveillance

01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,400
in a train station looking for bad

01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,320
actors and beyond agents in a train

01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,640
station

01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,320
education working with universities in

01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,280
order to deliver

01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,000
education where the students needed

01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,600
healthcare

01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,640
for simple services and um

01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:46,719
agriculture and if in a few others

01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:50,320
so now we're making 5g edge computing

01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:53,280
real not only for operators but also

01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,400
for citizens of the government by the

01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,600
way

01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,280
many governments across the world have

01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,320
similar intent

01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:06,159
of supporting and adopting 5g and

01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:11,040
sponsoring programs that will promote 5g

01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:14,320
within the countries even in lower risk

01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:17,840
settings such as retail shops

01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:20,880
5g nh can help stores

01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:24,159
analyze supply chain data

01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:28,159
detect spoilage uh

01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:32,000
or monitor metrics like cloud density

01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:36,560
that will add otherwise overwhelm

01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:40,159
the networks without edge computing

01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:43,040
we are really proud of these

01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,840
examples that are about building the

01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,840
network

01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,000
but also building now solutions and

01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,679
services

01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:55,120
that citizens in every one of us

01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:57,760
can use and most important increasing

01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,199
the revenue streams of our clients as

01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,760
they make investments

01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:04,320
to modernize and progress not their

01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,640
infrastructure

01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:08,480
finally i would like to thank you for

01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:12,080
attending this session

01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:15,199
i encourage you to visit

01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:17,120
the ibm virtual booth where we will have

01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:18,960
some 5g implementations for

01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:22,320
demonstration

01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:25,840
and i enjoy the rest of the conference

01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:31,840
most important stay safe and healthy

01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:31,840
thanks again

01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:38,159
thank you marissa uh that was great

01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,280
and by the way i don't know uh you know

01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:42,239
how many attendees

01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,840
picked up uh a glimpse of the book that

01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:46,960
was sitting behind your

01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,320
your desk it said making the world

01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,640
better

01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:52,640
how relevant in the recent times but

01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,080
anyway let's talk about open let's talk

01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,440
about open source

01:17:54,080 --> 01:18:00,000
really like the fact that you focused on

01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,199
industry verticals food hospitality

01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,679
manufacturing

01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:04,880
and i think we as an industry networking

01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:08,880
and edge industry

01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:12,000
now need to look beyond the 1.3 and the

01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,560
mpls headers and the protocols that

01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,840
you know made us all geeks and look

01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,000
beyond what

01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,040
we can do as an industry so thank you

01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,640
very much

01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:26,080
um to wrap things up for today um

01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:28,320
uh is is one of um you know google's

01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,520
own senior product manager in google

01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,880
cloud

01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:36,159
she heads up the portfolio including

01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,640
telco modernization edge computing

01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:40,800
content delivery modern apps etc

01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,760
you heard from amal yesterday uh during

01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,440
my keynote

01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,520
and you will hear a lot more details

01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:48,719
about uh you know google

01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:51,360
uh and google cloud in general today um

01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:53,280
and and and projecta is gonna talk about

01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,400
uh how cloud native telco

01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:57,199
and 5g and edge come together so please

01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:08,640
welcome

01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:10,719
project yoshi

01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,719
hello everyone thank you for joining me

01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,520
today i'm really excited to be here

01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,440
talking about

01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,320
accelerating the journey to cloud native

01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,320
telco and effortless edge

01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:22,719
now synergies between telco cloud and

01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:24,400
enterprise are growing exponentially

01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,800
in fact if you think of the last one

01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:28,640
year it's been exciting to see telcos

01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,400
and public cloud providers

01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,000
beginning to come together in ways we

01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,159
would not even have imagined four or

01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,400
five years ago

01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:38,719
as an industry we have three big

01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,400
opportunities to tap into

01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,040
first is working with telcos to

01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,560
transform their i.t network and services

01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,560
now this is going to be fueled by

01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:49,199
leveraging the best of technologies

01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,000
experience and talent that telcos public

01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:52,960
cloud providers

01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,719
like google cloud isps and others have

01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,480
with all of us becoming better in the

01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,560
process

01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:00,560
the second major opportunity is around

01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,600
delivering value to enterprises

01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:06,000
with 5g 4g edge computing solutions

01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,840
and 5g as a business services platform

01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,239
now this will create new revenue streams

01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,239
for the broader ecosystem

01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,400
the third is as much an opportunity as a

01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:15,440
necessity to enable the first two

01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,360
opportunities

01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,360
it's about breaking down the silos that

01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,719
have existed between the network and

01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,960
services platforms

01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,239
paradigms service orchestration

01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,840
automation and more

01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:28,480
used by telcos and public cloud

01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:30,960
providers it's also about jointly

01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,719
building pieces that don't exist yet

01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,239
that's how we can unlock seamless

01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,239
delivery of services

01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:38,320
across a global distributed edge and

01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,159
cloud

01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:42,000
what does it really mean to help telcos

01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:44,320
transform to a telco cloud

01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,600
first it's about helping telcos build

01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,159
their i.t

01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,719
by bringing telco id workloads like oss

01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:52,560
pss and data analytics to cloud

01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,239
this is the sweet spot for public cloud

01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,520
providers like google cloud

01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,280
because these workloads are very

01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,600
enterprise like

01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,679
for the telco network cloud we need to

01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,440
take cloud to telco locations

01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:06,239
where the network cloud is typically

01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:08,080
deployed the goal here is to bring cloud

01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:10,239
and cloud native technologies

01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,520
to help telcos build a capex and opex

01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:14,480
efficient network

01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,960
including for 5g the third is about

01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:18,880
helping telcos build new revenue streams

01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,199
with an enterprise services cloud

01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,440
offering 5g 4g and edge computing

01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:26,080
solutions for enterprises

01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,800
telco it network and enterprise services

01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,480
clouds

01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,560
represent a multi-billion dollar

01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,199
opportunity for telcos public cloud

01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,360
providers

01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,480
and partners over the next two to three

01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,719
years

01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,320
more broadly telcos will increasingly

01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:40,080
become public cloud first

01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,080
where they will operate new workloads

01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:44,320
projects processes and public cloud

01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,840
first and of course the telco cloud will

01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,120
increasingly use the global

01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,280
infrastructure

01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,560
edges and regions of public cloud

01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,840
providers like google

01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,719
for optimizing economics now at a very

01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,679
high level

01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,840
generally enabling telco it means

01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:02,480
bringing it to cloud

01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,320
generally enabling telco network means

01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,040
bringing cloud to wherever the network

01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,120
is

01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,719
and enabling enterprise services is

01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,560
about running solutions

01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,000
where it is optimal and bringing

01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,400
connectivity and cloud to these

01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,480
solutions

01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,040
to do this we need open scalable

01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:21,120
resilient network and services platforms

01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,960
that can work across telco cloud and

01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:25,600
edge

01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,760
a few additional observations vms

01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:30,560
containers heterogeneous northbound and

01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,560
southbound multi-provider multi-cloud

01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,639
and increasingly multi-edge are a fact

01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,159
of life in most telcos clouds and

01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,159
enterprises

01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:40,320
orchestration network and service

01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:42,000
management needs to be able to support

01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,560
this heterogeneity

01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,960
there is no one edge platforms need to

01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,920
work across a global distributed edge

01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,440
and cloud continuum for running network

01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,560
functions and edge computing for

01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:55,040
solutions

01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,080
we need integrated stacks not closed

01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,320
boxes

01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,000
these integrated stacks should bundle

01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:03,120
hardware os

01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,280
accelerators cpus gpus platforms that

01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:07,199
provide container or services management

01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,440
or services orchestration

01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:11,199
and of obviously the network functions

01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,800
or say aiml models

01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,800
and provide these instead of close

01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,639
proprietary boxes

01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,480
with this we get the ease of a box but

01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,400
without the lock-in

01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,679
observability analytics and automation

01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,760
are table stakes

01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:25,280
we need them at every layer and also at

01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,360
an aggregated level

01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,320
as well as end to end across the entire

01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,280
deployment

01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:32,960
coupled with closed loop automation we

01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,880
really need to start focusing more on

01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,040
abstracting out complexity so let me

01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,800
give you two simple examples

01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,880
we need an effortless edge which

01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,840
delivers automated placement of

01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,239
workloads based on desired outcomes and

01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,920
it

01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:48,639
it's continuously optimizing the

01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,120
placement if that's desired effortless

01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,440
specs

01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,520
now while i'm half joking here i think

01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,760
there's a huge value to doing this

01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,480
the idea is inspired by tools in google

01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,560
cloud called explainable ai

01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:02,000
explainable ai tools tell you why a

01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,080
machine learning model

01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,120
generated a certain recommendation

01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:08,080
similarly

01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,679
we need explainable ai for hc 3gpp and

01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,120
many of our own specs

01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:14,000
which map our standards and

01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:16,159
specifications to real world solutions

01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,600
and to existing open apis or the other

01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:19,760
way around

01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,360
these specs are very important no doubt

01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,639
but there's a huge opportunity for

01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,320
simplification

01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:26,480
and mapping them to benefits they can

01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:28,880
deliver thereby making them easier to

01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,560
adopt

01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,560
coming back to the consistent cloud

01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,600
native network and services platform

01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,280
that we need

01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,600
there are three core technologies that

01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,199
are important containers so for example

01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,600
open source kubernetes

01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:44,239
which is the de facto industry standard

01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,560
and say the google managed gke

01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:48,159
service mesh where for example is stu as

01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,480
the open service mesh

01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:52,000
and traffic director asm has open google

01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,840
manage service mesh

01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,760
and then you've got server list where

01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,360
you've got open source k native

01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:01,360
or say a google managed cloud run

01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,199
anthos from google cloud is actually a

01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,719
great example of a consistent cloud

01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:06,800
native platform

01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,920
it layers container management service

01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,880
management and server

01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,239
serverless into a modular platform so

01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,679
you can use the layers that are

01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,520
important to you

01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,880
anthos couples these with policy and

01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,520
config management

01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,719
along with ci cd observability analytics

01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,560
and automation

01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:24,800
it preserves the open interfaces and

01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,040
apis for google managed layers

01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,159
you can use anthos anywhere on-prem

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,199
google cloud

01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:33,280
in aws and more anthos continues to

01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:35,520
evolve rapidly to support new telco and

01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:37,199
edge use cases

01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,120
now we are all familiar with kubernetes

01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,880
so i'm not going to deep dive into that

01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:43,040
i do want to talk a bit more about

01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,480
service mesh like what really is a

01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,960
service mesh

01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:49,280
i think a few years back now you had all

01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,639
of these complex network appliances

01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,560
and then came software defined

01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,320
networking or sdn

01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,920
and it disaggregated these closed

01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:58,320
complex appliances

01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,600
into a control plane and a data plane

01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,199
the data planes were simple and

01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,960
forwarded traffic

01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:05,520
these data planes were controlled by a

01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,600
sophisticated control plane

01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,679
now think of a service mesh as software

01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:12,159
defined networking for services

01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:14,159
you take a complex application remove

01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:16,000
all networking code from it

01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:18,560
so you extract this out and you move it

01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,480
to a sidecar service proxy

01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,719
now you need to need a way to configure

01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,679
control and apply policies to these

01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,199
proxies

01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,679
and that's why you need a service mesh

01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:29,440
control plane

01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:31,679
one of the biggest benefits of service

01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,040
mesh is that it decouples development

01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,800
from operations

01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,159
developers no longer need to write and

01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,679
maintain policies

01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:39,199
and networking code inside their

01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,800
applications

01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:42,800
service mesh does not make any

01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,199
assumptions about where your services

01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,880
or whether it is instantiated on vms or

01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:48,800
containers or bare metal

01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,719
and that's why it provides a framework

01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,560
that can be used consistently across

01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,760
multi-cloud deployments across

01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,800
heterogeneous vm

01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:58,639
and container environments what are the

01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,560
use cases for service mesh

01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,159
so the first one is to simplify

01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,320
networking architecture

01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:06,320
and deploy advanced traffic management

01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,000
capabilities so think in aries blue

01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:10,800
green circuit breaking

01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,800
mirroring very easily second is to

01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,360
enhance security and encrypt all

01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:18,400
data in transit by automatically using

01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:20,400
mtls on all calls within the mesh

01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,719
third is to ensure more uptime safer

01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:24,960
rollouts and lower time to resolution

01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:28,719
with locks telemetry and traces

01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,719
gathered for every service in the mesh

01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,719
service mesh enables you to specify

01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,400
traffic management security

01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:36,400
and observability policies at the

01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,520
service level in a compute agnostic

01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,360
manner

01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,199
one use case of service mesh is

01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:44,480
obviously then to manage a mixed

01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:46,560
environment of vm and container services

01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,760
there's also a related use case which is

01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,639
to migrate vnb

01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,719
services to container services using cap

01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:54,560
grow drain strategy

01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:56,639
now in the past if you think of it

01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,280
telcos had mpls networks

01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:01,199
that they wanted to migrate to optical

01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,400
they started doing this using a strategy

01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:04,000
called cap grow drain

01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,600
in fact this was a term i heard from

01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,239
atnt and onf

01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,360
so you cap your mpls networks you grow

01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:11,280
your optical

01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,560
and then you drain existing mpls to

01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,480
optical

01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,159
the same applies to transition from vm

01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,840
to container services

01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:19,920
you continue to support existing

01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,520
deployment with vm orchestration

01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,280
then you introduce a platform like

01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,239
anthos for all new containerized

01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,560
deployments

01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:27,600
and then slowly drain vm based services

01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,080
to anthos

01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,719
driven container services in the interim

01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,280
period

01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:35,360
when telcos have both vmb services and

01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:38,159
anthospace containerized services

01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:39,840
these can exist coexist very seamlessly

01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,480
and they can also interact with each

01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,800
other

01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:46,159
at the service mesh layer since service

01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,159
mesh is compute agnostic

01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,040
service mesh is a key paradigm for 5g

01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:53,520
core service based architectures

01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:55,120
spa provides a modular framework from

01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,760
which common applications can be

01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,199
deployed

01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,880
using components from one or more

01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:02,880
providers in 3gpp defined spa

01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,719
control plane functionality is delivered

01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,760
with a set of interconnected network

01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:07,440
functions

01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,280
and that's why service mesh is a very

01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:11,280
good paradigm for connecting

01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:14,320
and managing these network functions as

01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,320
services in the mesh

01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:18,960
we continue to evolve service mesh as a

01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:20,400
paradigm so i'll give you an example

01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,480
adopting a service mesh has

01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,639
traditionally meant running sidecar

01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,920
proxies in the data plane that handle

01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,120
networking on behalf of your

01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:29,760
applications

01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:31,679
now proxies do consume resources and

01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,080
those may start to add up as you scale

01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,760
to hundreds or thousands of proxies

01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:38,080
for high performance telco and edge

01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,239
applications this may make it difficult

01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:42,239
to meet the performance targets when you

01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,520
are sending requests to multiple sidecar

01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,760
proxies

01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,360
so for high performance use cases we

01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:50,159
built out a proxy list

01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:52,159
grpc flavor of services with our traffic

01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:54,159
director service mesh offering

01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:55,600
and to make these proxy list services

01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:58,639
possible we

01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:01,120
what we did is we added the open xts api

01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:04,080
support which is used for envoy proxy

01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:05,440
to the most recent version of jrpc so we

01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,960
do need to keep

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:10,480
evolving our paradigms as well

01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,320
now in addition to everything we

01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,239
discussed what are some of the new

01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,760
problems we can partner to solve as an

01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:17,360
industry

01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,280
if you take a broader view of where we

01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,080
are as an industry we're just getting

01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,520
started

01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,840
and we have many things to solve

01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,920
together so while we are making great

01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,920
headway on creating consistent cloud

01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,360
native network and services platforms

01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,120
and evolving them

01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:33,199
we need to do more to abstract out

01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,400
complexity and manage heterogeneity

01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,920
better

01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,159
we need to get to the point where our

01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:40,159
network services and slices

01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:41,679
automatically scale and optimize are

01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:45,360
proactively secure

01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:47,679
and effortless to administer and use

01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:50,159
let's take the effortless edge problem

01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:52,239
now basically the edge is distributed

01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:54,639
to harness the power of this distributed

01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:56,480
edge i as a telco or as a public cloud

01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,400
provider or as an enterprise

01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:00,239
should be able to leverage any of these

01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,159
edges in addition to my own

01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,280
based on my own business and technical

01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:05,120
requirements

01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:07,040
i should be able to move my services

01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,040
from an edge it is deployed at

01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:11,120
to another edge so to bring it closer to

01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,880
the end user or lower cost

01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:14,560
i should be able to deploy a service

01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,480
that spans multiple edges

01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,320
so for example take the case of machine

01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:20,159
learning where for my services

01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:21,440
i may do small amounts of processing on

01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,880
the user's device

01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:25,280
which then connects up to a telco

01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,880
central office for scrubbing which then

01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:29,520
connects up to google cloud machine

01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,600
learning models at google's edge

01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,440
i should also be able to change services

01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,159
which are deployed across a variety of

01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,159
edges

01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:37,920
so i can leverage best of breed services

01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,719
from a variety of providers for my end

01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,719
customer

01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:42,000
or maybe i want to create a slice across

01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,000
this continuum

01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,679
and i should be able to do all of this

01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,280
as easily as possible

01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:48,960
without having to know where the edges

01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:51,120
are and without needing deep technical

01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,560
knowledge

01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,560
let's talk about another interesting

01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,960
problem that we could solve together

01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,320
this is to partner on effortless network

01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,639
slicing at scale

01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:01,679
yes network slicing is happening in

01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:04,639
experimental

01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,120
setups and at small limited scale but to

01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,960
fully

01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:09,440
unleash the monetization of network

01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,080
slicing we are missing a few abstraction

01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,560
layers

01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,840
i will describe one such layer it has

01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,480
the ability to treat

01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,159
everything as a service today it's

01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:20,239
possible to treat for example

01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:22,400
entities in a service mesh easily as a

01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:24,639
service but what about third-party

01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,320
opaque services or legacy services that

01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,080
sit outside the mesh

01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:29,600
we've started the work on extending the

01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:32,239
service abstraction

01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:34,080
across all of these as well and adding

01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:36,239
also a few other capabilities and we are

01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,120
doing this with telcos isvs and other

01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,639
partners

01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:41,840
and we look forward to collaborating

01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:41,840
with all of you on this as well

01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,840
now coming to the most important part

01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,480
monetization of these cloud native

01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,400
networks

01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,840
and new and new revenue streams for the

01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,239
entire ecosystem

01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,760
will be driven by delivering 5g 4g edge

01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:55,840
computing solutions

01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,440
and 5g as a business services platform

01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,280
for enterprises

01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:01,360
when google entered the mobile market

01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,719
with android in 2007

01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:05,840
it reshaped the industry in a

01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:07,679
fundamental way at the end of 2010

01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,280
android os became the world's largest

01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:11,040
smartphone platform

01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,960
android became successful because it

01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:15,120
offered three key elements

01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,280
android is the common platform its

01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,400
ability to run on a variety of devices

01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,560
and form factors

01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,800
ranging from cell phones to laptops to

01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,960
tvs and most importantly

01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,000
monetization for the entire android

01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,000
ecosystem

01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,320
through apps built on android and run on

01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,400
a variety of devices

01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,520
we believe the android strategy is also

01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,360
key for

01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,600
for the entire ecosystem to tap into

01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:40,000
monetization and we call this strategy

01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,679
global mobile edge cloud or gmax

01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,719
strategy so it's not a product it's a

01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:45,600
strategy

01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:47,120
there are three key elements to it first

01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,120
there's a portfolio of 5g

01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:50,400
edge solutions that we are all going to

01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,800
build together

01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,719
second is a common platform now these

01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,280
solutions need to be built on a common

01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:59,440
cloud native platform so for example

01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:00,639
we are providing anthos an open cloud

01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,560
native platform

01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:05,520
to help you build deploy and securely

01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:08,560
manage these new network-centric 5g 4g

01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:10,639
edge solutions anywhere

01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,560
third is the edge infrastructure we

01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:14,000
envision deploying these solutions and

01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,280
the open platform on a global

01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,440
distributed edge

01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:19,040
one with spans telco edge google edge

01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:21,360
customer edge and more

01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,679
we also aim to amplify the telco edge

01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:27,840
footprint with google's global edge

01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:29,679
including google's edge in telcos

01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,679
we can bring a multitude of benefits to

01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:33,600
the enterprise and industry verticals

01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,199
we can enable infrastructure takeout

01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,600
from enterprise locations

01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:39,440
without impacting the user experience in

01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,080
a pandemic stricken world with slash

01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,480
budgets

01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:44,320
we can enable enterprises to avoid capex

01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,480
heavy investments for their premises

01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,840
by leveraging edge and cloud for a

01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:50,480
different set of use cases

01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,880
we can bring reliable dedicated private

01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:53,679
5g 4g network to enterprise with local

01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,840
control

01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,520
local access to data and local decisions

01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,440
for real-time ops

01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,760
as network slicing at scale becomes

01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,520
available many of these use cases can

01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,480
also be served by vertical specific

01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:08,800
slices from telcos and other providers

01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,679
we can help deliver low latency or high

01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,080
bandwidth

01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:14,159
for real time apps like gaming and media

01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:17,040
we can also bring compute analytics

01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:19,040
aiml to the edge of the network which is

01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,119
close to the user or the workload

01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,119
and we can deliver solutions that are

01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:25,199
tailored to the specific needs say of an

01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:27,360
industry vertical

01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:29,040
for example here's an initial set of

01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,880
areas that we think all of us can

01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,080
productize and monetize in the next one

01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,080
to two years

01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,679
first is the dedicated private 5g

01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:37,760
enterprise solutions we call them

01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:38,560
connected solutions there's also lte

01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,800
here

01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,719
then the telco network edge solutions we

01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,320
call them smartex solutions

01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:46,239
there is media and gaming and then

01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:49,600
there's effortless edge

01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:51,280
now private 5g 4g brings the 5g 4g stack

01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,080
and edge computing to the customers

01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,400
premises

01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,239
to help build out a dedicated network

01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,679
this category delivers solutions like

01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:58,880
connected warehouse connected

01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:00,560
manufacturing

01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,080
connected mining connected venue and

01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,320
connected learning

01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:06,080
google is active in cbrs and has tools

01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,840
like sas and network planner which are

01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,840
useful for the industry

01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:12,320
as network slicing at scale becomes a

01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,719
reality many of these solutions can be

01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:16,800
delivered using these slices

01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:18,800
second category of solutions is smart x

01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,239
which is smart retail smart airport

01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,159
smart transportation

01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:24,080
this is about bringing cloud and cloud

01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:26,000
capabilities to the telco network

01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,440
edge and implementing it with google

01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,440
edge and regions

01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:31,040
solutions like smart cities are often

01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,520
smart connected which means they

01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,080
leverage both private 5g 4g on customer

01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,080
edge

01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,760
and edge computing at the telco or the

01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,080
google network edge

01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,679
our third category is media and gaming

01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:44,320
which includes cloud cdn

01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:46,560
stereo solutions and stereo solutions in

01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:48,000
fact stereo or low latency born in the

01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:50,960
cloud gaming solution

01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
is a perfect use case for 5g and edge

01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,239
effortless edge which

01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,239
i mentioned multiple times before is

01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:58,159
about abstracting all of the edges and

01:36:56,239 --> 01:37:00,239
services from enterprise telco

01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:01,280
partner and google developers and

01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,280
presenting simple

01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,360
outcomes based interface and controls to

01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:08,159
them imagine saying

01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,719
run my workload uh not in the specific

01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:11,280
set of

01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:13,280
edges but saying for example uh here is

01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,719
the latency i need or here are the geos

01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,480
that i want to serve my content

01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,639
in and then have your workload

01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:21,040
automatically get deployed across one or

01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:23,520
more of these edges

01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,239
to ensure that 5g 4g solutions that we

01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,400
co-develop

01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:27,520
actually solve real business problems

01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,400
and deliver the three

01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,239
e's experience economics and ease of use

01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,960
we need to define and build these in a

01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:35,280
triad

01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:36,159
that includes the end customer along

01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,199
with clearing in

01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:42,719
isvs content providers msps sis and

01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:42,719
device providers as needed

01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,199
the time is right to transform together

01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:49,600
there's a strong win-win for telcos and

01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:51,520
public cloud providers like google cloud

01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,600
driven by synergies and transformation

01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,719
to telco cloud and monetization via

01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,360
enterprise

01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:59,760
let's build on this momentum partners so

01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:01,280
your isps gsis and others

01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,520
are critical to transformation and

01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,800
monetization let's also enable their

01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,520
transformation

01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:09,199
let's demand open it's really about ease

01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,679
economics and choice

01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:14,000
contributing back to open source is key

01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:16,560
preserving open interfaces for managed

01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,239
commercial products is key

01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,760
we need to get to everything is a

01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,679
service it will

01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,040
enable many things including network

01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:25,280
slicing at scale

01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:26,960
to do this we need to push and expand

01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:29,040
paradigms like service mesh

01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,040
and also ensure that whatever we build

01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:33,280
is built for heterogeneity

01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,119
as an industry we are actually not known

01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:37,520
for abstracting out complexity

01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:39,840
let's fix this effortless specs

01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:42,000
effortless networks effortless edge

01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,920
effortless services these are all very

01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,199
critical features that we as an industry

01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,360
need to invest in

01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:49,520
and with all of this we also need to

01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:52,880
bring transformation around diversity

01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:54,639
equity and inclusion in our industry

01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,320
yesterday google cloud joined linux

01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,199
foundation networking at the platinum

01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,119
level

01:38:57,199 --> 01:39:01,040
we look forward to not only bringing the

01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:03,280
best of google to the industry

01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,560
but continuing to collaborate with and

01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,520
learn from telcos

01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:09,119
partners open source organizations and

01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,679
the broader industry to transform

01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:13,840
together

01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:13,840
thank you everyone
