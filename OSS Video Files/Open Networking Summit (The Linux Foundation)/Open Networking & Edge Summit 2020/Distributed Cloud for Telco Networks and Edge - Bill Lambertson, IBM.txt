hi and welcome my name is bill

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,600
lambertson and

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,320
i am a global director for

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,440
ibm's telecommunications industry and

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,599
this session is called

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,440
distributed cloud for telco networks and

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,279
edge

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,720
so i want to get started with kind of

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,880
setting a few uh pieces of context

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
so we're seeing around the world from a

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,760
global telecommunications standpoint

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,680
we're seeing a couple of trends

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,039
occurring and ibm is responding to meet

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,640
those trends

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,559
those trends are really around four

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,559
things number one

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,079
operators are looking to move to a

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,800
cloud-native architecture

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,160
for their network and their edge

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,160
solutions

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,000
and they want to be able to run a set of

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
edge applications as well as

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
cloud native network functions on this

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,399
cloud native architecture

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,280
so that's number one number two they

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,079
want to embrace

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,360
an open platform so they don't want any

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,719
vendor lock-in they want to have

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,239
interoperability

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
they want to support open source

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,000
communities and

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
they want to be able to leverage a

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
combination of

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
network functions from multiple vendors

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
so that's the second trend

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,680
the third thing that we're starting to

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,720
see is a real strong interest

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,840
in this whole concept of hybrid

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,000
for for cloud and it includes the use

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
of public cloud facilities to run

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
carrier networks on

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
and in my opinion this is going to be

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,560
something that is going to accelerate

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,079
very rapidly in 2021 um

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,840
i'm working and talking with major

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,119
operators around the world and they

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,640
see a very strong role for public cloud

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,640
as part of their network environment and

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,119
that's a change from what i've seen over

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
the last

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,360
couple of decades and that public cloud

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
is not only in public cloud facilities

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,159
but it's the also the use of public

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
cloud

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,880
um in the in what i call a distributed

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
cloud model meaning deployed

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,960
a public cloud deployed on premise or in

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,240
a carrier's network data center

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,360
so that's the third trend and the fourth

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,960
trend really is that as operators make

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,840
significant investments

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,000
in infrastructure to support the

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
deployment of new 5g

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,200
and the clarification of the network

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,760
environment

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,520
they want to also connect that to

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,120
top-line revenue growth so they want to

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
monetize services and that's really

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
where the edge part comes in

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,520
so ibm in partnership with

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,360
many isvs as well as as global operators

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
have developed a set of solutions and

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
offerings really targeting the space and

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
what we refer to as

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,040
distributed cloud for telco networks in

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,160
edge and it's built on these four

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,959
pillars

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
it is a cloud native first or container

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
first

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,720
architecture um and it's and it's built

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
on

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,959
ibm public cloud and our new distributed

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
cloud offering called

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
ibm cloud satellite so that's the first

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
thing

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,959
the second it is open source and it is

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,680
it is basically based on a

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,440
a community um of open source source

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,400
technology and partners

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,480
driven by red hat and red hat open shift

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
and red hat openstack which has

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,720
a very broad and rich ecosystem in the

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,760
telecommunications space

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,720
the third thing is is that our solution

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,080
is really as a service offering so

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,360
operators want the ability

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,440
to leverage and consume resources as a

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,159
service and they want to be able to

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
to align their spend with their revenue

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,560
streams

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,159
and this is really important important

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,480
concept and why really the public cloud

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,239
piece comes into play

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,239
and the solution has to be really

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
carrier grade and

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,480
focused on the telco industry so we've

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,519
worked with a set of of partners

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,519
um to ensure that the capabilities are

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,519
integrated well and that there's an

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,560
onboarding process and a certification

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,280
process

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,519
to bring partners into the ecosystem and

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,439
we work with red hat very closely

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
on that certification process and we

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,280
work within our own organization around

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,439
the certification as well

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,360
so this is really the whole concept of

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,840
distributed cloud for telco network and

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
edge and

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,080
let me tell you a little bit more about

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,640
about it so i mentioned that

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
um it is based on what we call ibm cloud

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,280
satellite

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,799
and cloud satellite is in fact a

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,239
distributed cloud

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,440
and it allows an operator to be able to

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,759
consume public cloud resources within

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,560
their own data center environment

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,280
and so uh distributed cloud or ibm cloud

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
satellite

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,960
kind of sets it up like this on the left

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,800
hand side of this chart

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,360
is the public cloud and this is really

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,800
where all of the cloud resources

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,160
are are are running it's where we do

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,320
all of the operations it's where the

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,320
the control plane is established for

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,600
things like config

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,120
using um using razzy as well as a

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,120
service mesh based on

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,120
itzio and we extend this environment

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,639
through cloud satellite down to an

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,880
on-premise location

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
and we refer to that as a cloud

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,680
satellite location

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
and we are able to deploy a whole set of

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,520
public cloud resources onto your own

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,000
environment things like red hat open

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,199
shift as

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,680
an example database as a service and a

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,759
whole set of rich ibm public cloud

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,199
content that you can use around machine

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,160
learning and other things

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,720
to complement your network environment

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,120
and

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,759
the cool thing about cloud satellite is

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
is that there are many ways to deploy it

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,120
or consume it

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,400
so we don't force you into have to

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
having to provide

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
or consume our own hardware stack we

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,639
give you many many different choices so

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
you can bring your own infrastructure

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,639
it can be bare metal or it can be an is

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,960
service and we can deploy the

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,720
the cloud satellite location solution on

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,520
top of that

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,360
or we have an appliance based solution

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
that you can basically order

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,919
and roll in and then plug in and start

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,479
up as a cloud satellite location

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,039
for those operators that don't want to

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,680
have to

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,360
provide the underlying infrastructure so

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
these are a couple of options that are

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,400
available and there's a whole set of

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,440
hardware that's supported underneath it

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,560
including

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,400
um you know gpu capable servers as well

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,160
as things like

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
servers that have the ability to do

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
hardware acceleration

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
with large pci slots in it so it gives

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,120
you a broad range of

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,600
choice that we know are important for

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,280
operators to run network functions on it

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,520
so these are a couple of the highlights

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,759
and and it's managed the service

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,400
is managed by the ibm public cloud

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,800
company so we provide all of the updates

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
for the services that run on top of it

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,080
whereas you're responsible for the

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,720
underlying infrastructure

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,240
or we can provide services um to support

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,680
that underlying infrastructure if you

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,680
choose to do that as well

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,759
so that's the start of the of the

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,800
solution and let me build on that a

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,120
little bit

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,479
so from a from an operational standpoint

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,479
in a configuration

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,599
we provide a single pane of glass for

00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,440
you to manage your

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,120
public cloud and your cloud satellite

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,919
resources and so

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
you can quickly build and and stand up a

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,960
facility

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,199
a cloud satellite location you can

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
deploy an instance of red hat open shift

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,199
down to that cloud satellite facility

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,960
and you can deploy applications or

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
network functions on top of that

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
that open shift environment that's just

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
an example

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,800
and you have full transparency and view

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
of all of the resources that are running

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
across all of your cloud satellite

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,560
locations so if you had it deployed

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,759
across multiple metropolitan data

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
centers you would be able to see them

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,919
all

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,720
and manage them from a single pane of

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,560
glass also if you have a set of services

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
running in the public cloud you're also

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,280
able to manage them from the single pane

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,520
of glass

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,960
so we provide you know consistent

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,759
security control

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,680
compliance from this platform and it

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,120
gives you the ability to focus really on

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,720
running your network and not worrying

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
about the underlying infrastructure that

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
it runs on

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,039
so it's an exciting announcement it's an

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
exciting offering that

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,599
i believe personally will have strong

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,479
capabilities and relevancy

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,479
in the telecommunication space so let me

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,039
go through and kind of share

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,560
a big picture view of what does it mean

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,800
for an operator

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
so if you take a typical network

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
environment i know there's

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,960
really no typical one but you have you

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,520
know multiple topology layers you may

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,680
have a couple of national data centers

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,840
um and maybe a couple of dozen

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,919
metropolitan data centers and then below

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,879
that you'll have local data centers

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,440
supporting your

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
you know your ran environments and such

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,479
and

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,599
really where we think uh cloud satellite

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,640
fits well

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,360
is in those um distributed network data

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,760
centers

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,000
both at the metropolitan layer and also

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,200
down to the local data center layer

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
so you can have things like your oss or

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,160
your bss

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
solutions running in the ibm public

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,800
cloud to take advantage of the low

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,800
infrastructure

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,920
and then you can deploy cloud satellite

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,720
in your metropolitan

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,640
or your or your local data centers and

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,800
be able to deploy network functions and

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,160
data and ai and edge solutions

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,399
on top of that and the beauty of this is

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,080
that by deploying cloud satellite

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,680
into one of your metropolitan data

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,720
centers you now

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,200
instantly have an edge solution a

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,839
network

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,440
mech as an example where you can provide

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,000
you know depending upon your location

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
but maybe

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,920
5 10 or 15 millisecond round trip um

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
latency capabilities for for edge

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,800
workloads

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,480
and so operators are looking at this as

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,440
an ability to support

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,480
their new 5g network functions and

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
network solutions

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,200
but also at the same time integrate that

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,560
through things like network slicing and

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,120
be able to deploy

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,240
on top of the same platform a set of

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,160
machine learning and

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,399
and automation and data and iai

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,760
solutions targeting the edge space to

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,080
help you monetize it

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,600
and grow the revenue on the top end so

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
this is kind of an example

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
and i'm going to show you a real

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,800
topology drawing just to kind of put it

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
on a little bit more clarity and some

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,480
context

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,600
so if i go to the next slide here's just

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,160
an example of the

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
topology i was describing so at the top

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,360
is a public data center where you may

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,880
have all of your analytics and your

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,839
security solutions

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,399
your ci cd pipelines your vim control

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,640
plane

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,120
um across your environment all running

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,200
on a public cloud running on openshift

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
and then as you start to drop down into

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,519
your metropolitan data centers

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,279
here's an example of five locations you

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
know one might be in an ibm cloud

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,160
property

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
you might also put it on top of another

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,240
public cloud property

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,000
um and it stole it on top of the is

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,600
solution that they provide

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
uh you might put it into one of your

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,760
network data centers if you have the

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
space

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,760
and the environmentals in that network

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,720
data center or you can use a colo

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,959
facility um

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,279
and just provide you know be able to

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,240
acquire space or rack space to be able

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
to deploy it

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,000
and this really does now extend the

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,560
public cloud property down

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,560
into your own network and puts it in

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,720
close proximity of your users for low

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,320
latency capabilities

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
and then as you drop down to the lower

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,440
level this might be an example of where

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
you might be doing um maybe your dus or

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,959
your

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,880
or um you know your your virtual ran and

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,040
you may choose to deploy these on

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
things like open stack instead of

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,959
openshift

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,519
and this could be a private um cloud

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,920
solution

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,880
tied into the broader distributed cloud

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,680
platform

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,720
so the true sense of hybrid leveraging

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,040
public cloud

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,399
private cloud and cloud at the edge to

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,600
really deliver

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,240
a holistic solution for distributed

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,720
network and edge solutions so that's

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
kind of

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,839
the highlight now i want to get into a

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
couple of the other things that i talked

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,360
about because

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,240
i've only started to really discuss the

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
nfvi environment for the infrastructure

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,320
and the vim environment for you know

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
running the virtualization layer on

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,000
which is our is the red hat solution

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,320
but there are a couple of other things

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,399
that that ibm is bringing to the table

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,639
or has available today that complement

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,360
this and are important

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,760
so um orchestration amano is the next

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,120
layer

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,880
right and um we have launched uh in may

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
a solution called telco network cloud

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,040
manager which

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
is essentially three or four components

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,560
as

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,920
part of a a suite of of solutions so the

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,600
first one is a

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,959
life cycle management and network

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,079
orchestration tool

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,720
and it does um dynamic um

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,839
placement of or intent-based

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,720
orchestration for your network solutions

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
um it's not like other orchestrators

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,839
where

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,519
many of them on the market today have

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,160
workflows or scripts that you have to

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,760
define

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,760
this is really intent based so there's a

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,800
lot of logic that's built into it

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,720
to to automate the process and to make

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
it available at scale

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
the second element is around service

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,240
assurance so we have a whole set of

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,279
service assurance tools

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,600
that not only can you use multiple vnfs

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,519
or cnfs from multiple providers

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,440
but you can also do full end-to-end

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,959
lifecycle management you can orchestrate

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,320
them and deploy them and then you can

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,079
run automation

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
and service assurance on them for day

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,519
two support

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,279
and we also have a whole set of

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,720
capabilities around performance for

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,880
network performance

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,800
and then just recently we launched a

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,720
capability based on watson

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,959
called ai ops so it's really about

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,160
enabling artificial intelligence in the

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,560
operations environment

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,920
and helping you do cognitive you know

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,760
taking it beyond predictive but do

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,519
cognitive recommendations

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,360
um in the in the network environment

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,120
from an operational standpoint

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,959
so this starts to bring together the

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,800
whole value chain of

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,279
what we have available for the network

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,000
side now let me talk to you a little bit

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,240
about

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
what we do around the edge capabilities

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,760
because

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,040
in the world of 5g network and edge are

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,480
really going to be very much

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,320
tied at the hip and we're going to be

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,040
looking at solutions that support both

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,639
of them

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,320
and that network slicing will do

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,320
different things for customers based on

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,760
the workloads they want to deploy

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,680
so they're they're very much tied

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,920
together so

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,120
we launched a product called ibm edge

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,040
application manager

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
which is an autonomous edge solution

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,000
that allows you to deploy

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,360
at scale data ai and edge

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,519
applications or edge-enabled

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,600
applications and you can deploy them

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
down to kubernetes environments like red

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,399
hat open shift

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,160
or you can deploy them down to

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,040
individual linux containers

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,800
so like a docker or pod man and what's

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,760
really unique about this and important

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,600
is that this not only lets you address

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,079
the edge in the it

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,639
applications and service offerings but

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,680
it really

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,199
unlocks the area that's going to grow

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,959
significantly and that's around

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,920
operating technologies

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,360
so everything of value as we move

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,519
forward is going to be connected

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,480
and is going to be instrumented and

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,279
intelligent

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,160
and essentially have a processor built

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,639
into it

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,079
and so being able to orchestrate and

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,000
manage those resources

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,000
even if they're operating technology

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,639
like in a factory floor or

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,279
robotics or drones that might not be

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,480
part of the

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,360
traditional i.t value chain but more on

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
the operating

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,639
on the operation side it allows a telco

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,160
as an operator to participate in this

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,160
explosive growth around um far edge

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,839
devices and the growth of of operating

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,240
technology components

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,120
so um we have a lot more information

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
that's available

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,079
in our virtual booth

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,079
which i encourage you to take a look at

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,959
this but it's about bringing edge

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,120
applications

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,480
and telco network cloud functions

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,959
together

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
and then on top of that you know it's

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,079
one thing to have the platform to be

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,920
able to deliver these capabilities and

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,560
all the tools to orchestrate and set it

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,199
up

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,959
but what really unlocks the value now is

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,880
about having the content or the

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,560
or the services the edge-enabled

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,040
services on top

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,079
to bring out the business insights so we

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,519
have a whole set of

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,800
capabilities around edge that

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,000
are focused on data and ai solutions

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,959
for like industry 4.0 use cases worker

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,959
safety

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,639
ibm manufacturing or production

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,120
optimization

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,040
visual inspection of using intelligent

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,360
video analytics to be able to recognize

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,519
things or situational awareness

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,639
ibm visual insights to be able to

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,880
recognize

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,279
people that might be wearing masks or

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,199
should be wearing a hard hat

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,560
and a whole bunch of capabilities around

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,600
what we refer to as

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,600
maximal worker insights and maximo

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,839
has been around for a very long time and

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,680
is an industry leading

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,000
asset management solution that we've

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,839
evolved to include

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
predictive maintenance on a lot of those

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,680
assets so helping

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,920
large enterprise customers predict when

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,839
something might fail like a

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,279
you know a conveyor belt in a factory

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,000
and being able to do

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,480
acoustic analytics on the ball bearings

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,440
of that

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,199
of that um that uh conveyor belt and be

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
able to predict when things might fail

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
and to be able to

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,680
perform services on them so this is the

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,519
exciting part about

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,440
building these kinds of capabilities on

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,000
top of the platform of our distributed

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
cloud for

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,880
network and edge and so i want to kind

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,919
of bring this all together for you

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,919
in the big picture here and this is a

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,319
complete solution end to end

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,919
and some of our clients pick and choose

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,520
some components of this you know so it's

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,199
not an all or nothing kind of thing

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,520
that's the beauty of it you can do

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,280
do it in different ways uh some

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,240
customers look for a fully managed

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
service

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,919
others are just want to buy the software

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,320
asset and they want to manage it

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,960
themselves that's certainly an option

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,039
and

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,799
a couple of examples of clients that you

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,160
may have heard of and and you actually

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,120
might even be listening and i'm very

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
proud of it

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,919
is we we launched a partnership and a

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,360
set of capabilities with

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:51,039
with barty airtel in india around

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,600
deploying a a set of of

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:58,720
virtualized network solutions for their

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,039
mobile operator environment and we also

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,600
announced a partnership with vodafone

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,840
idea which is now called vi

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,120
and um they're rolling out a whole bunch

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,600
of micro clouds

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,559
based on these technologies so let me

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,080
explain to you what some of them are

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,559
first of all at the bottom in the

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,919
infrastructure we give you a a broad

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,679
choice around

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,200
the nfvi environment or the

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
infrastructure and hardware that you can

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
run on

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,600
so it can be bare metal it can be in for

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,960
i as it can be

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,880
power systems or x86 and

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,400
it can be ibm or non-ibm so it doesn't

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,400
really matter

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,720
and then we layer on top of it this you

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,400
know cloud satellite capability

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,080
that runs on on red hat enterprise linux

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
or core os

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,679
and then on top of the the the red hat

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,480
environment we deploy

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,840
red hat open shift and that becomes the

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,240
container first

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,160
architecture or infrastructure to now

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,039
start building applications and services

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,120
on

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,120
and we have and i talked about this in

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,039
the in this this discussion here we have

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,559
a couple of orchestration engines

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,280
one of them is called ibm edge

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,640
application manager for the industry 4.0

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,559
use cases

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,679
the other is telco network cloud manager

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,720
for the vnf

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,799
and cnf lifecycle management and then

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,520
multi-manage multi-cloud management

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,360
management for advanced cluster

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,240
management across different kubernetes

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,480
clusters

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,360
so that kind of does the the platform

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,520
piece

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,200
and then we have a set of capabilities

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,360
available on top of that

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
and i mentioned some of them around the

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,799
edge-enabled applications

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,559
we also have a whole set of machine

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,799
learning and data science tools that are

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,640
starting to be used in the network space

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,400
starting to be used in the security of

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
the network space and other elements of

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,559
it

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,640
and um we also offer a set of services

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,960
to help operators

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,240
design build deploy and manage all of

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,840
these environments

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,679
and it's exciting because you know ibm

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,039
is really in a very unique position

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,440
these days where

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,600
in the i.t space we've been doing a lot

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,960
of this stuff for a long time

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,240
but as the world of network and edge

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,240
starts to more

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,919
become more cloud-like and move to cloud

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,000
native architectures

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,760
uh it's an opportunity that was just

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
coming towards us where we have so much

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,400
experience and skills in

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,679
to help telecommunications companies

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,120
really pick and choose the right

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,080
strategy and the right

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,400
approach going forward and we're vendor

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,000
agnostic so we work with a lot of the

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,440
with many of the network equipment

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,520
providers

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,360
all of them all of the top brands and

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,039
many of the emerging ones we've worked

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,960
with them to onboard it on their

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,039
on the red hat environments onboarded

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,679
into the orchestration engine

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,159
and uh we can provide really a key

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,840
capability for

00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,400
telecommunications service providers

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,520
around

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,080
their plans to develop and deploy 5g

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,080
network and edge solutions so i hope

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,159
that you'll spend some time

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,280
checking us out further in the virtual

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,960
booth

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,640
and we'll have some product demos some

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,000
virtual demos on a couple of

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,080
different items here and remember ibm

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,360
cloud satellite it's ibm's distributed

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,039
cloud

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,760
and also in closing i will say that

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,520
um many of the services that run on top

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
of this platform

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,320
are part of the red hat marketplace

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,159
which was just launched a few weeks ago

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
it was announced back in may and was

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
just launched

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,559
it's a red hat marketplace operated by

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,280
ibm

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,880
so you can feel safe and secure that the

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,720
software that you're downloading from

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,240
the marketplace to be deployed on your

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,120
openshift environment

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,400
um is you know is is secure and

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,080
trustworthy

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,679
and there's a lot of innovation going

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,960
there so i'd encourage you to look at it

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
as you start building
