okay hello

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,359
good morning everyone i'd like to

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,960
welcome you to the open networking and

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,280
edge summit

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,519
sponsored by the linux foundation

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,320
today's talk will be on cloud federation

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,680
in iot

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,640
and edge applications by dr

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,240
sharif mahmudi from siemens and myself

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,119
robert bond from nist

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,119
next slide please

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,600
today's talk will will show

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,840
a slight introduction to federation

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
then it will give the promise of

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
federation

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,920
and what we can expect to have in the

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,320
future

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
it will describe a collaboration between

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
nist and the ieee

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
and the development of a cloud reference

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
of cloud federation reference

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,559
architecture and standards

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,559
around that i'll give a fuller

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,559
description of federation

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,600
then i will describe the nist cloud

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,120
federation reference

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,400
architecture after that i will describe

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,080
the ieee and the p2302 work

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
on standards for inter cloud

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,560
interoperability and federation

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,240
and its current status and finally the

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,119
use cases

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
next slide please

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,960
in early 2010 niss was charged by the

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,159
uscio to develop

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,600
a roadmap for cloud computing standards

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,799
and technology

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,520
in this road map which was developed

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:39,360
in which was developed with a group of

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,479
stakeholders in industry academia

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,799
and the government we were able to

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,840
we were able to develop a reference

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,600
architecture

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,520
and this and this roadmap the roadmap

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,880
shows 10 requirements that are needed

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,520
for fast safe and quick

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,200
adoption of cloud computing into the

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,320
federal government

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,479
earlier the nist had defined cloud

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,200
computing and in that document

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,200
defined community cloud as supporting

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,920
organizations that have a common set of

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,680
interests

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,760
for example mission security or policy

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
sometimes a community cloud cannot be

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,480
implemented in one public or private

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,280
cloud

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,239
which is why multiple clouds are needed

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
to

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,360
support the governance and processes

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,840
which enable federation and

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,680
interoperability

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
this was the core requirement of

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,959
requirement 5

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,319
frameworks to support federated

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
community clouds

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,480
found in the nist u.s government cloud

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,920
computing technology road map

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,879
miss sp 500 293 volume one

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
next slide please

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,920
when we talk about federation we we

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,640
understand there's a need to connect

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,599
real world collaborations data and

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,760
resources

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,640
with practical collaboration methods and

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,599
tools

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,120
data exists all over and people need to

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,519
get access to that

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,159
what is the easiest way to be able to do

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,480
that

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,720
well federation addresses how to

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,640
securely manage collaborations

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,640
when the resources being shared are

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,959
inherently distributed

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,959
we realize of course that there's a

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,480
spectrum of collaboration needs

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,959
approaches and sizes of federations

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,959
for example we could say there's a bare

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,760
bones federation which is small

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,200
and manually managed one might think of

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,400
a couple of

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,400
students in a dorm room who share who

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,280
develop a small federation where they

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,560
can share

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,879
services amongst themselves on the other

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
side

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,560
on the other hand there are

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,840
industrial-sized federations

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
very large scale highly distributed many

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,360
things are automated

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,120
there's accounting there's auditing and

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
there's legal controls

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
because we exist in a regulatory

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,840
environment

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,840
next slide please

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,879
the nist and ieee collaboration

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,920
consisted of

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,640
two parts as as i

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
described earlier nist recognized the

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,239
importance of the frameworks

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,799
to support seamless implementation of

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:24,000
federated community cloud environments

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:27,280
and with and in discussions with ieee

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,080
decided that nist would

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,040
continue working on that requirement but

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
ieee

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,680
would take take the

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,320
output from nist and then go on to

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
develop

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,120
standards around that and you can see

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
from the ieee

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,639
p2302 project authorization

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,240
authorization request the purpose was to

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
create an economy

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,919
amongst cloud providers and an economy

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,360
is something

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,880
that is bought and sold and traded so

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
what could that be that could be

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,360
services or resources amongst other

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,039
cloud providers this should be

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
transparent to users

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,280
and applications so a user does not want

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
to have to stop

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,479
and think they want this to be simple

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
and

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,880
dynamic for them and again this will be

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,039
a dynamic

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,720
infrastructure that can support evolving

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,960
business models

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,160
the standard itself will define the

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,400
topologies

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,360
functions and governance for cloud to

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,320
cloud interoperability and federation

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320
next slide please

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,199
here are the goals uh as i mentioned

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,600
the uh nist group will develop a cloud

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,960
federation vocabulary and conceptual

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,360
model

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,919
this interim output will be contributed

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,080
to the ieee p2302

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,759
working group in real time and the

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,479
ultimate output will be in this

00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,639
bub special publication the ieee

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,479
p2302 working group will develop a cloud

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,759
federation standard

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:09,039
based on the previous scope and purpose

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,080
the p2302 initial output then

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,960
will be an ieee standard and with plans

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,840
to contribute

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,160
this to the iso jtc1 to create an

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,160
international standard around cloud

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
federation next slide please

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,840
the essence of federation is

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,720
more or less an identity management

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
problem

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,960
as we see as we see two systems here on

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,000
the left and right

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,520
system a and system b we see how does

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,120
user a

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,319
essentially manage to find the services

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,880
from system b

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
how can system b manage its

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,560
discoverability

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,759
and how can system be or service

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,400
provider b

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,319
validate user a's credential and make

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,800
access decisions

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,039
this is what this the essence of

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,360
federation boils down to

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,440
next slide please in addition to that

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
we will find that there are also other

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,560
essential characteristics of a

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,639
cloud federation a federation is a

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,520
virtual security and collaboration

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,000
context

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,720
that is not necessarily owned by any one

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
user or

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,840
organization since only specific

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
users sites and organizations

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,080
collaborate for common goals

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,039
these participating entities have

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,720
membership

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,319
in the federation and identity

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,160
credentials that are linked to each

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,160
member

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
the users sites and organizations can

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,360
participate in the federation by

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,039
choosing to share

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,879
some of their resources metadata

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,080
and making them discoverable and

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,319
accessible to other federation members

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
participating members agree upon the

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,960
common goals and governance of the

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,599
federation

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,360
based on well-known roles attributes and

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,319
policies

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,319
next slide please

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,280
here's a simple three plane model of

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,199
cloud federation

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,160
as we see uh at the bottom slide

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,199
plane which is the truss federation plan

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,400
this is where

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,720
the two site administrators decide

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,199
that they will trust each other in order

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,720
to carry out a federation

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,759
so what that trust relationship

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,759
is and the exact structure and

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,880
governance of the federation

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,680
is to be decided uh by the governance

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
structure

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,440
we can say this occurs in the trust

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,560
management plan

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,680
in the federation management plane above

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,399
once this is done each site admin or

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,440
federation operator deploys a federation

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,160
manager

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,800
initially these federation managers are

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
empty

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,320
since they are not hosting any

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,000
federations yet they can be called

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,279
internal since they are deployed

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,080
and operated internally to each site

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,080
once deployed secure communications must

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
be established between the federation

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,279
managers

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,200
in any way suitable to ensure that their

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,240
communications are not susceptible to

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,440
eavesdropping or

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,839
interception this is necessary be since

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
the

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
federation managers must exchange

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,480
information concerning the management of

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,880
federations

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,560
that is valid and trusted this could be

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,560
called the federation management plan

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,720
once this secure communication has been

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,720
established the two site admins can

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
create a common federation

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,839
in this example this is called

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,320
federation foo

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,519
when initially created it's empty and

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,040
unconfigured

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,800
what is important is that both

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,240
federation managers maintain a

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
consistent state for foo

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
over its lifetime from a practical

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,080
perspective

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
one site admin may invite another site

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,640
admin to join through their federation

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
manager or one site may ask the other to

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
be allowed to join

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,640
for this example this is how this

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,959
happens is not critical

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,600
once federation foo has been created

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,360
across all federation managers

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,279
what is actually being created is a

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,480
virtual administrative domain

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,839
and illustrated in the top federation

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,959
usage plane

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,440
in this plane federation foo is neither

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,480
blue

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,640
nor red but purple federation foo is

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,279
also empty or unconfigured

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
however immediately after creation a

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,959
federation's first member would

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,279
typically be a federation admin

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,760
we know that there could be one or more

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,040
fed admins that are users from site a or

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,959
b

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,040
once the federation has been created and

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
its management is in place

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,720
it can be populated with members and

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,600
services to accomplish its business

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,440
goals

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,680
the federation admins could grant

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,720
management and authorizations to other

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
users

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,959
resource service owners from a and b can

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,040
make services available in foo

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,959
by registering their service endpoints

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,640
and defining the associated discovery

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,040
and access policies

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,680
these users services policies

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,440
authorizations could change dynamically

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,200
over the course of the federation

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,200
lifetime next slide please

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,079
finis cloud federation reference

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,360
architecture

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,560
published in this sp 500-332

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,079
in february 2020 is presented here

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,360
as you know as you notice this is a

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,519
after role-based model much like

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,519
the original nist cloud reference

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,720
architecture that was published in 2011

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,000
the commonalities we have between those

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,160
two models

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,480
are the we have a cloud service consumer

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,920
we have a cloud service provider we'll

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,959
have a federation

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,399
we have a carrier an auditor

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,440
and a broker now when we increase the

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,360
complexity

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,040
to talk about having a cloud federation

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,000
we need to have some methodology

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,519
or actor who will manage the federation

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,880
and that will be the federation

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,200
operator the federation manager is a

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,959
software system that manages the

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,120
federation instances

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,360
and all those all those small rectangles

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,600
inside the membership the policy

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,839
management the resource the monitoring

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,079
accounting and billing and portability

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,959
interoperability

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,959
next slide please

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,519
the objectives of the ieee

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,600
standards for inter cloud

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,639
interoperability and federation working

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,880
group

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,040
as i mentioned the purpose was to create

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
an economy amongst cloud providers it's

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,440
which is transparent to users

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,279
applications and provides for a dynamic

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
infrastructure that can support evolving

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,880
business needs

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,600
so in essence this group would like to

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,160
create cloud federation standards which

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,639
support a transparent infrastructure

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,880
much like the internet and phone network

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,600
it would need to be cloud implementation

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,079
independent

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,360
like internet routers based like the

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,600
phone network

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,000
it would have to be a simple protocol

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,000
set and easy to join

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,519
there should be support for generalized

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,399
resource federation

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,040
not just virtual machines but all

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,320
services

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,639
up and down the stack and also support

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
for

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,480
multiple federation topologies through

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,880
network abstraction

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:34,720
and finally globally scale capable

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,040
next slide please

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,639
some of the possible deployments that we

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,800
have been investigating

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
on the left you see a third-party

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,480
centralized trust model

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,760
on the right you see peer-to-peer

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,760
cloud federations on

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,079
on the left-hand side the third-party

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,000
trust model each site is

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:01,279
participating through its own through

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,360
a centralized federation manager

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,320
and then becomes part of the federation

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,199
that way

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,920
whereas on the other side the two sites

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,639
are

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,639
equivalent next slide please

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,120
one description that the ieee is working

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
on

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,720
now is this third-party centralized

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,959
trust model

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,760
and you can see there are federation

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,040
members

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,120
up at the top that connect into the

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,000
federation hosting service first they're

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,959
authorized by coming in through the

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,199
authorization

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,440
endpoint and checked out through the

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,279
open id connect server

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,160
once once they're permitted to go

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,360
and use these services there's a policy

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,399
enforcement point

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,680
which is set down by the service owner

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,240
and he registers his service finally

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,399
uh there's a list of services in the

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,360
service catalog uh

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,000
and finally we see in the federation

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,199
instance

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,240
database there's uh three catalogs a

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,399
member catalog

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
a roles and attributes catalog and a

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,800
service catalog

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,120
and those are um those are set up

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,720
so a member can only see what he's

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,560
allowed to see

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,199
next slide please we are working on an

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,720
api

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:28,560
development in the p2302

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,360
currently we have a small core api

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,639
that was finished in may uh we're

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,880
looking at the

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,639
we completed the federation operator and

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,399
the federation hosting service to

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,720
federation hosting service

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,839
apis which will help with the

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,040
peer-to-peer

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,279
model we are currently undergoing uh

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,399
development of the monitoring

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,440
api which is going to be key when we

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,880
move on to do

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,000
other things like auditing and billing

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,680
next slide please and thank you and

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,720
i'm going to introduce dr sharif mahmudi

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,240
to describe use cases

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,680
yes thanks so from uh

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,440
from my uh from my side um um

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,279
sheriff mahmudi so i'm working as a

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,399
software architect for intelligent

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,440
systems for

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,639
siemens corporate technology in the u.s

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,040
and when i had a

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,120
few years back at discussion regarding

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,160
cloud and edge federation

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,240
with bob that was quite

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,680
interesting on what kind of use cases

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,880
could be enabled

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,399
by this technology

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,079
uh both uh for industrial application

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,000
and also some general purpose

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,880
applications so i will spend like that

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,079
ten

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,959
fifteen next minutes talking about some

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,600
of those use cases that i had a chance

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,880
to

00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,160
uh work work on uh but

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,120
first let's um revisit

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,079
the uh the differences or what this

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,799
federation is

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,360
introducing in term of features or

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,480
functionalities compared to the current

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,280
deployment that's like it's mainly

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,039
mainly captures uh on the right hand

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,559
side a classical

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,360
or accurate deployments

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,240
uh from the cloud to the edge where we

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,160
can see that

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
uh services from the edge are

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,520
communicating with cloud services

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,320
and the same services from the edge are

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,440
also accessible for the field

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,320
devices and here in instance a camera

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,559
can record some videos send it to an

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,320
edge node which can run for example some

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:49,919
ai inference on this data

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,520
before sending the result back to the

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,480
funny the results back to to cloud

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,760
what the federation is introducing at

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,880
that level is that

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,919
uh we are not talking about uh

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,480
vertical silos in such a way that

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,080
we have a typical path to go but we can

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
share resources

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,720
at the edge and at cloud in such a way

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,919
that we can leverage

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,120
services that are either

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,760
owned by someone else or that are part

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,240
of that

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,520
third party development that the

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,640
application

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,400
needs to run in the better

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,120
and an optimal in an optimal way

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,039
so uh the point is we are trying to

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,080
leverage this kind of

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,520
new interactions possibilities that are

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,799
provided by the

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,760
by the federation to build use cases on

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,240
top of them

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,960
and they will start or one of the use

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,919
cases

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,960
it's not an industrial application it's

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,919
more

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,880
looking at how we could how we could

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,120
enable

00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,559
multiple small farmers or multiple

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,280
small nodes to leverage a processing

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,400
capabilities from their name neighbors

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,520
and case study here it's mainly

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,720
for to fight the wheat trust

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,720
diseases and um here if we are

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,320
we are talking about an underserved

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,559
served area

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,240
where uh there is no uh reasonable

00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,200
connectivity infrastructure that links

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,480
the different

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,760
farms together and also to a city where

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,320
we can have

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,320
a reasonable internet connection so the

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,440
zones here what i'm referring into

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,160
to zones like this blue areas and also

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,919
the

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,240
yellow areas are independent zones

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,160
where we have some connectivity where

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,919
the drone for example can fly

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,200
to it inspect the different

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,640
the different plants and see what is

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,960
going on over there however there is no

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,559
obvious link between the the different

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,640
zones so we worked

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,960
into a networking technology based on

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,520
named data networking to allow

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,600
the communication in a kind of

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,320
opportunistic connection between the

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,679
zones and also between the city

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,679
where that is providing like the

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,320
external internet access

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,200
however the implementation of that was

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,720
mainly

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,200
um we had a challenge which is

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,440
the resources compute resources that are

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,840
available are not enough the smaller

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,799
medium farmers cannot afford

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,520
having a huge networking infrastructure

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,679
or use

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,360
a cloud in a classical way so the

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,480
federation here was a

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,880
kind of um interesting solution

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,520
in such a way that the different zones

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,840
are

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,960
considered as participants with

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,559
federation

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,440
and they can mutualize their resources

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,919
in such a way that they can use a

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,880
computing power or services from

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,799
other zones as much as available this

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,520
effort was done as an as an

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,000
early stage experiment in collaboration

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,679
with some universities from europe and

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,320
from africa uh the next use case it's

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,480
mainly

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,000
for some applications for some

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,960
industrial applications

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,400
for for perception and the main

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,000
challenge here is that

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,039
how we could uh compose

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,440
some or enhance the perception where we

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,559
are

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,760
when we are having multiple inputs that

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,320
are potentially owned by multiple

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
multiple stake stakeholders and here

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,799
assume that

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,760
the field devices are devices that are

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,280
owned by multiple entities and also the

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,559
infrastructure at the edge

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,360
it's not owned by a single entity

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,840
and the point here or what we looked at

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,159
it's

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,679
how we could enable a federation between

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,640
those age services

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,280
and field devices and to push that to

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,799
use

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:08,559
specific services from the cloud mainly

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,120
uh machine learning as services for from

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,039
there

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,919
and what we looked at more especially is

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,159
could we break the inference in two

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,960
levels like a level it's done

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,400
uh first we are collecting the data

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,960
doing some binding from

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,520
protocols because the sensors are not

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,799
using

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,840
the exact same protocol all uh on

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,880
from all the stakeholders and then do a

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,480
first layer of

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,679
inf inference then materialize that

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,840
or put or aggregate those data

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,360
from a songtran node to be able to

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,760
exchange with cloud

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,120
and here the assumption is that these

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,520
different nodes are

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,440
are not owned by the same entities so

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,720
cloud federation allow a

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,440
dynamic way to map those

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,480
different resources together and also

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,200
have a kind of

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,159
view of what is available and what could

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
be used

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,919
for the application not from the

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,400
participants

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,360
perspective but from a federation

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,960
perspective

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,280
which enhances the capabilities or

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,799
the optimization in term of resource

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,400
usage and resource

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,280
deployment uh the next

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,760
the next use case is uh a federation in

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,799
term of

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,840
platform and uh here i seem at siemens

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,400
we are developing

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,280
or we have a cloud solution called

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
mindsphere

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,880
which is mainly dedicated for industrial

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,000
applications

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:42,159
and some of our customers are

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,960
have already um deployment using other

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,600
major cloud provider and they want to

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,360
use minesphere for some specific purpose

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,520
and also they want to have the

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,400
possibility to leverage

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,559
their uh processing or their

00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,000
infrastructure that they have already

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,559
on this cloud provider and

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,320
leverage all that with the application

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,080
that they are building on top of siemens

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,200
mine sphere

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,039
so uh here the experiment that we use

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,640
for that use case is mainly

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,799
how we could enable a kind of

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,559
lightweight version of the

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,679
uh of of the federation in such a way

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,880
that we could

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:26,720
use uh for example iot devices

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,039
or iot uh connectivity that is already

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,320
set up from a third-party cloud

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,440
provider and uh use that

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,640
as if it was a device uh

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,200
onboarded into a minesphere a minesphere

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,679
cloud

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,760
and here we looked also to some aspects

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,840
in terms of binding and protocol

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,880
binding mainly for some protocols

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,679
relevant for

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,200
industrial applications but federation

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,000
was a kind of

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,799
interesting way to explore how we could

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,120
simply

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,159
link dynamically services that are

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,520
external

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,440
to the siemens mind sphere and still be

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,960
able to leverage them to build some

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,559
application or to build

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,159
an application for for our customers

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:15,360
uh my last use case it's mainly

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,559
uh addresses this scalability

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,600
and the point here is um um

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,240
assume that you have some uh service

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,279
providers that have a workflow and this

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,360
workflow might be

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,960
reading from a sensor like employment

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,279
implements in a control

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,559
a control loop in a kind of cyber

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,720
physical system

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,000
reading from an iot device or reading

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,320
from a sensor

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,480
doing some processing to that data and

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,200
then writing it to an actuator

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,559
if we take as simple a use case as

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,080
simple as that

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,799
and cloud is there is we can

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,960
aggregate this use case or this workflow

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,240
in term of a unique big workflow that

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,799
can be executed

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,679
however to be able to enhance its

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,000
performance and also its scalability

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,400
that might be limited by the bandwidth

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,760
or the availability of the bandwidth to

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,240
cloud the the idea here is to break it

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,120
down

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,360
in multiple sub-components and those

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,640
sub-components like delegate them

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,080
or make them run and use uh

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,559
services from dedicated cloud

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,679
provider and here like the service

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,200
provider

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,440
is deploying the workflow or requesting

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,520
information from the federation manager

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,360
regarding where the difference what are

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,840
the capabilities of the different

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:41,039
participants and then according to

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,720
this features or these capabilities

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:47,679
decides where every components or

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,799
every specific piece of the workflow

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,000
should run

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,039
to to have an optimal to have an optimal

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,080
result we experimented at that level uh

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,200
mainly uh the local programming

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,720
platforms like

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,559
mendex and node red and uh

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,559
the result was quite interesting in

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,200
terms of distribution as

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,840
it reduces the need of a communication

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,159
or

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,400
exports and imports between different

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,720
cloud provider and also adds some kind

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,760
of

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,880
near real-time capabilities

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,799
so um with that those are those were the

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,240
main use cases that i

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,360
wanted to share during this uh this

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,960
presentation uh was also to mention that

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,039
or to get involved into this cloud

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,039
federation

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:49,360
activity uh there is links right here
