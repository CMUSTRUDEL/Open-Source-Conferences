00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,800
i also want to talk about the content it

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,000
is the richest content ever

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,399
and you know it is very exciting because

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,040
the topics include networking and edge

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,600
telecom cloud enterprise you know from

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,240
access

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,920
edge core infrastructure to applications

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,200
and then obviously in the uh geeky sense

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,519
layer one through seven

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,959
across all industries whose business

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,800
mandates connectivity

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,040
so let's go ahead and get started i'm

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,880
gonna take a few minutes to talk about

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,959
the uh state of networking

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,519
and let's look at where we are

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,160
the summary of this is what a year and i

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,360
think that says it all

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,959
but if you ignore the current situation

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
i think we have a lot that we have

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,920
accomplished over the past three years

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,920
we have

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,680
answered five very hard questions

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
and i want to walk you through that very

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,040
very quickly so

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,720
thank you all for answering that i know

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,240
you don't have don't don't know what the

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
questions are but

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,399
give give yourself a round of applause

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,880
well okay you know virtual

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,519
uh all right here you go the first

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,399
question

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,880
that was very important was why should

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,639
we go

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,440
open and linux foundation has released a

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,600
white paper

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,639
that you should absolutely download that

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,120
talks about

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,720
how vertical industries have really

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,639
taken advantage

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,079
of transformation through open source

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,120
right whether it's telecom at the

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,519
forefront

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,680
automotive motion pictures fintech

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,959
energy public health etc

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,360
and the power of speed of innovation the

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,440
power of faster time to deploy

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,120
all of those things are the reason why

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,240
people have gone open

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,399
and i call it open sourcification

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,240
really exciting times take a look at

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,839
that that's

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
one thing that we have solved as a

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,040
community and then if you look closer to

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,079
what we do

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,959
uh which is open networking and edge

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,959
uh today we are releasing a results of a

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,800
survey done to our community who are

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,360
part of open source

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,560
and they look at you know why do we go

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,399
open source

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,639
and normally three years ago your answer

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,360
would be hey it's cheaper it's free

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,440
that's not the case anymore the top

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,279
reasons why people want to do this

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,959
is market creation adoption acceleration

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,240
and really look at the industry

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,839
influence yes cost is there but it's a

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,320
very different set of

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,120
requirements on why they wanted to open

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,639
source

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,160
so we're releasing this survey do

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,800
download it from the

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,320
from the web as well uh the second

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,000
question that we have answered as a

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,920
community

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,800
was is it standards or is it open source

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,880
three years ago

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,560
you know people would ask should i

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,680
implement standards or should i

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,279
use open source as a de facto standard

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,959
that's all new so all the press

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,759
listening to this don't worry about it

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,399
right this is all

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,600
old news harmonize was a hot word three

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,880
years ago

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,600
and thanks to the standards organization

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,040
uh you know whether it's gsma 3gpp mftm

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,680
forum at crm

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
we are fully harmonized across open

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,839
source

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,480
and standards and we are very excited

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,440
about that and by the way unification

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,360
extends well beyond uh open source and

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,920
standards now markets are getting

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,959
unified verticals are taking a direction

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,800
here so

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,880
that's the second problem our second

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,360
question we have answered

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,800
the third question that was very uh

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,320
important was

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,160
uh why should we contribute why can't i

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,720
just consume

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,399
and that is a very valid question but

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
what we have found is people who

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,600
contribute people who lead the community

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,120
have a 75 percent more likelihood of

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,959
gaining more productivity

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,399
within and outside their organization

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,480
they get an inherent

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,440
advantage over market share and on their

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,120
competition

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,560
and as an example on the right you're

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,120
seeing this picture

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,320
that is one example of a project for

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,519
caldonapp

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,560
where in the latest release of frankfurt

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,639
four of the top ten contributors where

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,520
from the end users and operators you

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,160
know at china mobile orange bell canada

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,640
dtt

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,559
mobile vodafone verizon among others

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,600
right who would have imagined

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,839
an operator contributing code

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,839
right three years ago so things have

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,600
changed things have really moved from

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,000
consumption to contribution

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,400
and not only onap right open daylight

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,199
has just announced the 13 release

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,319
aluminum today cntt came out with the

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,559
baroque release

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,360
wow and then we have two upcoming

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,440

german release so

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,720
very very exciting times on contribution

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,640
then came you know how do i move pocs to

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,600
productions or proof of concepts to

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,840
production

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,120
and there were three things that were

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,720
involved there was a compliance and

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,240
verification involved

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,840
there was an interrupt and testing

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,440
involved and then there was a training

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,880
and certification involved

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,200
and we're really excited to say that

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,840
uh you know projects like opnfvc and tt

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,880
akreno are leading the open interop and

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,440
and compliance uh but not only that we

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,960

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,440
uh end user groups operational in

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,280
our projects and then what today we're

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,799
doing is we're announcing two new things

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,679

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,480
in as a personal leader in the market

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
and then finally everybody worries about

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
money

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,440
uh what we are releasing today is a

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,799
research study

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,039
that was published for lf networking

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,440
and the question we asked is how much

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,320
value has open source created in lf

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,080
networking

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,600
and we looked at the eight projects

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,360
right over the six years

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,080
two thousand plus developers right

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,720
contributing code contributing a lot of

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,919
things

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:32,720
globally and it is quite

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:36,080
amazing at how much uh you know 7.3

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,679
billion dollars of value and 87.6

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,640
million lines of code again this is

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,280
using the

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,840
analytics insight tool from lf as well

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,400
as the kokomo 2 model of estimation

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,760
so this is you know unheard of because

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,120
if you go and ask

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,760
the business unit for those so much

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,240
funding

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,120
it's not going to happen so you know

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
just

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,640
you know we're really excited and

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,000
thankful for such a large shared

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
contribution

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,840
so with those five questions answered

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,600
let me let's move to the three

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,320
priorities that are important

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,000
in 2020 and these priorities have been

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,480
given to us by the communities

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,559
and they are for the communities and

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,520
it's very important that we all align to

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,799
that

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,000
priority number one please help with

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,720
interop and compliance

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
as quickly as possible and simplify

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,360
things

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,440
and you've all heard about acronyms

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:32,480
right uh lfn ovp cntt opnfv

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,480
kubernetes this that right etc

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,520
and one of the most important things we

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,799
are doing today

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:43,120
is we are announcing a merger of

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:45,679
cntt and opnfv this is very exciting

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,240
uh because it simplifies a whole bunch

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,880
of reference models architectures

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,440
reference implementations and the

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,159
batching and validation program

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,280
it is it is it is really exciting times

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,080
because

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,159
it's very simple and i would say it is

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,280
going to be the merged entity

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,080
under linux network lfn like foundation

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,520
networking

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,960
which will lead the industry for

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,760
harmonization across the entire spectrum

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,440
of reference models architecture

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,320
implementation and more importantly

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,559
compliance and

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,880
verification we are obviously going to

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,679
be partnering with gsma openstack and

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,919
kubernetes

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,919
utilizing the fundamentals of kubernetes

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,919
certified providers inside

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,039
um you know the matching process they're

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,159
all integrated

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,000
and aligned uh collaboratively so very

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,799
excited about this announcement

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,559
uh please join us there are tracks on uh

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,640
governance there are tracks on

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,080
operations there's graphs on branding

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,520
right that are going on right

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,039
now and um you know this is a huge

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,880
deal for the community because it's been

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,559
two years since you know these teams

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,720
have been working very nicely

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,919
and if you look at if you look at the

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,480
reason why

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,039
you can see that the global community

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,240
between cnt and lf networking

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,320
it doesn't even fit in one slide okay so

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,520
i'm just throwing logos here but it is

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,640
very exciting so

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,720
we have a full set of

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
companies members as well as

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,440
participants taking advantage of this

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,919
compliance and verification program the

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,440
most important thing about this is

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:27,039
it's a simplistic view of in adaptation

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,080
and moving projects into deployment very

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,919
quickly okay

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,760
and i think beth from verizon and scott

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,600
from att have set it up

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,120
very well in this quote right everyone

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,559
benefits and it's

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,640
really great conclusion here okay

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,000
the second important priority is the

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,720
end-to-end architecture

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
and this is about unified edge and

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,600
access

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,159
so let's talk about how things come

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,880
together let me first talk about orang

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,960
oran is a very important project we are

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
hosting the software community for oran

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,559
here

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,919
and essentially up and down the stack

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,240
things and projects are getting

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,799
integrated very very quickly

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,640
uh oran sc obviously has the bronze

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,000
release coming out and support

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,559
uh with onap and other other projects

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,200
and before uh you know i talk about some

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,520
of the other

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,960
projects i also want to give a shout out

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,880
to an upcoming project

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,159
like xg villa which is like a cnf

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,679
creation and odim which is

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,440
infrastructure management

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,000
both projects are getting through wiki's

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,360
establishment and there will be another

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,280
interesting part of the overall

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,640
ecosystem here as well

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,320
so let's double click on edge

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,880
and for those of you who have not seen

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,280
this diagram i would highly recommend

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,520
everybody sort of following using this

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,480
because the community has come along

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,760
and defined the terms very very nicely

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,440
and clearly right

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,960
there are two edges the user edge and

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,840
service provider edge you know

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,000
one is dedicated and and operated the

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,039
other one is shared and as a service

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,960
uh the user edge has three types

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,799
it's a really constrained iot type

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,600
environment then there's the gateway

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,840
types and then

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,360
obviously there's an on-prem type data

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,400
center type environments

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,640
all three are type of edges and then

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,600
the last smile separates the service

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,760
provider edge

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
and it kind of bleeds in it's not a hard

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,919
cut there's access edge

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,640
and things like that so we're very

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,480
excited to host these projects under lfh

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,799
that allows everything from

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,960
you know infrastructure to applications

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,520
from constrained to service provider

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
edge

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,880
and you know you will hear more about

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,080
these projects really

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,120
in the um in the upcoming days lots of

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,520
blueprints

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,200
uh lots of cloud and and service

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,760
brighter edge interactions you'll hear

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
about

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,200
but we're really excited that the edge

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,320
is really picking up

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,080
so well and not only is it picking up i

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,600
would claim that 5g and edge are

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,440
critical in the next battle

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,760
it's four times the size of the cloud

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,480
market according to several analysts

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
and the use cases are solidifying both

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,760
at a vertical level

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,799
and at a horizontal level so really

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,240
excited about

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,000
about the edge the third priority and

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
this is extremely critical and you might

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,240
have hear heard and read about it

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,960
is how clouds and telecom come together

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,440
okay

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,760
and this is very important because 5g

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,320
edge and iot are fueling this

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,840
um about a year ago we had a very simple

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,760
diagram on how

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,760
vm architecture and cloud native

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,600
architecture can coexist

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,960
and we are really excited to sort of say

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,600
that you know cncf

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,440
cloud native networking foundation lf

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,440
networking are working very very closely

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,240
specifically with kubernetes on

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,960
how we move the cloud native telecom

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,360
forward

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,080
in the view of a hybrid world with pnf

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,799
vnf

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,240
cnf and that's just not just the network

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,039
applications it's

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,760
all cloud native applications and so

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,279
with that

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,880
end uh who better than to talk about

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,320
cloud native uh then uh you know someone

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,360
who has really

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,080
you know shown great leadership here

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,320
i want to welcome amal fudge who's the

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
managing director of google

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,679
a global telecom industry at google

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,880
cloud amol are you there

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,480
can we patch you in

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,400
i'm garrett pitt can you hear me yes

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,400
yes so please go ahead welcome

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,919
thank you thank you rp thank you for

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
this welcome thank you for the

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,960
introduction

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,320
hello everybody uh welcome to the

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,600
conference

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,720
um as arbit said you know

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,640
we have decided to join lfn

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,200
and it's really because we at google

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,840
cloud passionately believe

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,360
that multi-cloud architectures are going

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,400
to be the way forward

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,440
as our industry gets disrupted

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
reformed and reshaped and so in that

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,679
context

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,760
our view is that open ecosystems like

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,520
the ones that rp talked about

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,279
are really the way forward for us to

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,279
converge as opposed to vertically

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,679
integrated solutions

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,720
and so it was natural for us to start

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,440
engaging

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,080
on several initiatives whether it's cntt

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,559
whether it's

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,960
own app whether it's the vnf

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,880
certification validation program as they

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,480
move towards cnf

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
and then you know given our leadership

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,559
of kubernetes and open source

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,159
it was a really natural fit for us to

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,240
join lfn

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,360
i personally am thrilled to join the

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,799
board i am

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,039
really looking forward to working with

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,159
this community as we sort of

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,039
shape this open system going forward and

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,279
i think given

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,399
elephants collaboration approach in the

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,880
industry

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,880
and their leadership in open source

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,120
frankly i'm very excited to see the kind

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,360
of innovations that are going to come up

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,559
in the next many weeks and months so

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,039
very excited

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,640
thank you arpit for this welcome and

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,320
looking forward to the next steps

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,640
back to you arbit thank you amal

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,360
this is very exciting and i'm really

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,000
pleased to

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,120
say that this is great news for the for

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
the telecom

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,640
and uh networking industry in general so

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,080
you know

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,279
uh welcome um i would say uh

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,679
if we go to uh you know the

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,039
the the usage of kubernetes in

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,360
telecommunication

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,559
uh there are several things that need

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,159
focus okay

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,360
and i think uh the the importance here

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,159
is we have to agree that you know it's

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,360
not perfect

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,320
but tremendous project project progress

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,480
has been made

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,520
so let me sort of uh you know show you

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,320
uh let's see why is this flight not

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,320
advancing

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:47,279
all right can we

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,760
there you go thank you uh so

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,960
there are some challenges uh that you

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,080
know surveys from

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,559
operators have uh looked at uh and the

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,480
challenges are networking obviously and

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,720
the performance around the hybrid

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,760
network and these are the areas where we

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,159
welcome communities to solve and uh

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,520
what better than to now go deeper into

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,279
these areas

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,000
uh of onboarding and and looking at the

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,559
cloud and

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,520
uh telecom coming together uh for those

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,760
of you who are going to

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,679
stick to us stick with us through the

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,320
conference there are some very good

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,600
demos

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,240
right there's uh demos on 5g cnfs

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,360
with onap as easy as one two three

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,159
policy-based

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,080
oran's open time uh non-real-time rick

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,760
there's lfn technical meetings coming up

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,799
in october et cetera et cetera

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,679
so lots of good things to understand and

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,559
participate

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,880
but before i go into uh the the next

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:49,039
level of details i wanted to introduce

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,360
a couple of colleagues here who will go

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,399
and walk you through the demo so let me

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,640
introduce

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,159
heather kirksey who is the vp of

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,600
ecosystems at the linux foundation

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,760
aramark caparia

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:05,520
at the ceo of arna networks

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,000
they will walk you through a cool demo

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,120
to show what i just talked about or we

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:23,840
just talked about

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:23,840
so you know take it on heather welcome

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,880
thanks so arpit for that uh awesome

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,679
introduction

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,480
and it is great to be here on our

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,000
virtual onis keynote stage with you

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:41,039
uh welcome everyone good afternoon hello

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,480
uh great to see you all here uh at our

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,559
first virtual on es

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,520
and although i really do wish i could be

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,760
seeing all of you

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,960
in person i'm really excited that we do

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,559
have the opportunity to come together

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,799
as an ecosystem for networking and

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,320
being able to hear all the great things

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,200
folks are doing

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,600
so as uh arpet said i am heather kirksey

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,559
i

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,600
am the vp of community and ecosystem

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,880
development here at

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:12,399
lf networks and i will be joined shortly

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,480
by my colleague amarka pottia from arna

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,440
and we're really excited to be sharing

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,640
with you this demo today

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,799
on uh cloud native 5g uh you know

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,559
5g is obviously one of the big things

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,159
for our industry right now

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,880
and uh as well as as is adopting a cloud

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,039
native

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,159
architectures and technology and one of

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,320
the things that we've learned is that

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,640
it's really a journey for all of us

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,679
uh in the open source community in the

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,360
vendor community

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:44,480
and for our operator end users and so

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,399
you know as a group we've decided

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,679
uh you know about a year and a half ago

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,919
that one of the things we wanted to

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,600
start doing with some proof of concepts

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,600
to prove out some things and to ask

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,640
ourselves some fundamental questions

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,360
so if you were able to see us uh

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,320
live on the kubecon keynote stage just

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,880
about a year

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,279
almost a year ago uh that was our first

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,039
iteration of this proof of concept

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,440
and at that point we asked ourselves a

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,240
question which is can we build a full

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,399
end-to-end

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,440
network architecture that is cloud

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,360
native

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,240
from the technologies we use to deploy

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,120
it as well as the cnfs that we put on

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,640
top of it

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,159
and can we make it compliant with all

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,399
the 5g specs and

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,679
we will it be a real enough network that

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,120
we can actually send

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,279
some actual content across it so that

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,640
was the goal that we set ourselves uh

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,880
for last year

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,360
and i think that we can sort of safely

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,000
say given that it did work on the stage

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,600
uh that we were able to do that um but

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,120
as we talked to each other you know one

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,279
of the things that we realized

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,679
was we had another fundamental question

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,880
to ask as we start to think about real

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,720
life and deployment and operations of 5g

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
obviously just getting a network out

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,279
there getting some applications on that

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,360
network

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,760
although a really you know sort of

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,240
initial fundamental problem to solve

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,200
is not the only problem because we need

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,600
to talk about

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,240
onboarding multiple cns we need to talk

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,320
about

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,279
integrating in with our service

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,880
orchestrator

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,080
we need to make sure that we can

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,039
integrate with mano and with the oss bss

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,039
and our back ends

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,799
because that's how these uh networks are

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,240
really going to be deployed and used

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,919
that's how they're going to be used in

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,320
an operator environment so

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,279
obviously the next thing we needed to do

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,480
was integrate sort of the infrastructure

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,080
with onap and uh you know make sure that

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,519
we could integrate with onap

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,600
in a cloud-native way with these

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,679
cloud-native applications and so that

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,720
was the sort of overall question that we

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,440
asked ourselves

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,200
at the beginning of this process and you

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,880
know to go back to what our pit was

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,480
saying earlier in terms of the three

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,039
really important themes

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,360
that we're really looking at as an

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,600
organization and as an ecosystem

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,200
obviously this is 5g we're looking at 5g

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,399
network uh networks

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,880
and 5g applications um and then

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,559
also that end-to-end system thing is

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,799
into in system view

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,039
right yo we created it into a network

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,440
last time but that's really not the end

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,200
system that you need so getting this uh

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,679
integration between things like our

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,480
network

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,879
infra and our service orchestration is

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
really

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,240
important so that end to end piece is

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,599
there and then obviously the

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,919
interoperability

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,839
and the ensuring that a multi-enviro

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,040
multi-vendor environment is something

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,800
that can be done

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,079
by us in the industry being important

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
one of the great things and

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,359
i'll go into more detail about this in a

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,839
bit is that we have

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,760
hardware software platforms software

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,240
applications from multiple vendors

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,359
across

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,280
multiple labs and so you know

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,720
it really gets to those three key things

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,599
we were trying to do

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,399
uh this year as a larger organization as

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,879
well

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
so with that sort of your top line goal

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,599
we had three

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,040
sort of sub goals that we were trying to

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,320
accomplish one

00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,480
is to onboard a uh

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,440
5g core uh to onboard 5g

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,720
core cloud native functions and using

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,839
onap code

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,440
second is to demonstrate deployment

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,320
of a 5gc next generation firewall onto

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,960
kubernetes

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,359
with a software-defined network fabric

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,960
and then third of all to use

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,839
an emulator to simulate the radio pieces

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,280
of the network

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,119
so that we could validate that the

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,119
entire thing really was functioning

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,440
all right so you know um i think

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,240
most folks are aware that there is uh

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,720
some uh migration that is needed as we

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
go

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,480
from our sort of you know where we

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,040
launched with nfv with a very

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,040
very vm centric infrastructure to start

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,040
embracing cloud native obviously there's

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,480
a lot more to embracing cloud native

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,240
than just using kubernetes or

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,760
containerizing your uh

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,079
your applications there are things like

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,800
ci cd and agile development

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,560
but we really wanted to uh focus here on

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,400
sort of the software infrastructure

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,079
and the cloud native infrastructure also

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,359
keeping in mind that especially for us

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,760
in the telecom industry

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,119
where legacy never goes away uh we're

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,280
never going to

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,880
or not for some time at least going to

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,880
move away from vnf's

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,240
so that we need a hybrid infrastructure

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,560
that can really support

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,599
our vnfs as well as these new cnfs that

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,040
we have coming

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,240
uh on board and so you know with this

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,640
you know onap

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,760
is is a great sort of piece of software

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,079
to be using in this

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,720
it was designed to be multivim from the

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,880
very beginning and multi-vnfm

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,839
so we are able within the context of

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,200
onap

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,839
to bring kubernetes along and alongside

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,520
its existing support of openstack to add

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,520
in support of kubernetes

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,960
so you can deploy workloads onto

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,119
openstack you can deploy

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,280
workloads either to your kubernetes edge

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,560
or to your kubernetes core

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,720
onap itself also supports multiple

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,920
design time tools for applications it

00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,680
supports heat

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,119
for your openstack applications it

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,240
supports tosca

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,760
and it also supports helm uh you know a

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,240
technology that we

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,359
are using from our our siblings over at

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,760
cnf and

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,520
cncf and that great community and you

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,320
know it continues to be standards

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,160
compliant

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
and there's also a great deal of control

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,560
loop functionality analytics

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
functionality

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,079
inventory functionality so all of that's

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,440
there in onap

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,720
to support the cloud native

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,880
functionality as we make this transition

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,359
so to get into a little bit more detail

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,160
about our proof of concept itself

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,720
we have two labs that we connected one

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,200
being

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,040
a lab where we were deploying our 5g

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,560
core and where we had our radio

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,480
network simulation in montreal and one

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,839
where we were deploying the control

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,280
plane at

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,800
in new hampshire hosted by unh iol

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,119
and connecting those by a

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,119
software-defined fabric running over the

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,359
public cloud

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,320
okay now digging a little bit deeper

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,200
into that topology and architecture

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,960
as i mentioned we do have a lab deployed

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,720
in montreal

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,160
and as you can see on this diagram that

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,839
is where we've got the

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,119
5g simulated radio both the ue

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,720
and the gmb provided by rebaca and then

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,760
we've got an entire

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,720
5g core with all of those 3g

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,359
3gpp compliant uh capabilities that

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,040
define

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:29,760
the 5g core as well as a

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,040
a firewall and then we are using a

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,079
software-defined

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,200
sd-wan fabric to connect that lab

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,400
into our unh io lab where we have got

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,960
the control plane

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,960
and the onap distro and one of the nice

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,680
things about this too is in a real 5g

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,040
network

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,040
you're going to have multiple

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,160
distributed places you're going to put

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,920
different workloads

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,760
in different places in your network and

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,560
environment and we're able to do that

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,560
here so

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,000
we are testing out some of those real

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,960
life operational

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,640
workload placement capabilities and

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,839
showing how to connect those

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,400
with a real live production ready uh

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,320
uh software-defined fabric so getting

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,880
into our software stack and hardware

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,040
stack

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,640
and how we built that up um as i just

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,079
mentioned we have lab infrastructure

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,359
brought to us by kulum

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,079
and unh iol and one of the nice things

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,160
too

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,400
obviously onap has been one of the focus

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,960
areas of this demo but we wanted to

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,200
remain

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,720
in contact with the folks defining

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,480
things like the infrastructure

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,760
and one good thing to note is that these

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,599
labs are

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,920
uh cntt compliant labs so we're keeping

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,800
up

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,040
with that compliance and interactivity

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,839
and interoperability work that cntt

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,599
has been bringing to the table uh you

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,920
know continuing to work with our

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,960
opnfv brethren and folks over at the tag

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,640
um lenovo has provided a server server

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,520
infrastructure for these pods

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,400
a column providing a software-defined

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,680
fabric

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,040
and then we've got a kubernetes distro

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,160
this one provided by

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,160
by red hat and then a number of

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,839
uh functions provided by a number of

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,280
vendors so rebacca

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,000
providing the uh the 5g

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,920
radio emulator uh the user plane

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,560
function provided by kulum

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,280
the 5g core provided by altran our next

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,599
generation

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,280
firewall provided by a10 and tourney and

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,599
providing our sd-wan

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,880
interconnectivity and once again those

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,760
just shows the power

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,880
that we were able to to bring together

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,040
distributions

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,000
of open source software and multiple

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,319
different

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,920
uh hardware and software vendors here

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,599
and have this work here this has been

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,920
our vision of nfv

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,520
for a long time and we're really

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,599
beginning to see it happen

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,720
and then finally of course we do have an

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,680
onap uh distribution provided by arna

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,720
and then as well as some proof of

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,599
concept work

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,680
going on within a working group in onap

00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,000
uh you can find that there in the repos

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,000
that intel has brought to the table so

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,760
we've got this great software stack

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,079
uh multiple hardware vendors multiple

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,760
software vendors doing cloud native

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,680
5g services uh using onap

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,280
and the great thing is that we were able

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,480
to pull this together without

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,160
uh you know a ton of effort

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,760
and um that we were able to do it in

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,200
this multi-vendor fashion

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,640
so with that you're probably tired of

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,160
hearing from me you don't want to hear

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,520
me talk about the demo you want to see

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,000
ammar present the demo

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,359
so at this moment i would like to ask

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,400
amar to come join me

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,880
and to present uh the actual

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,560
demo itself and i'd just like to remind

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,079
folks this is real code

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,119
this is uh actual running code

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,920
connecting to

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,359
real labs with real pods of hardware so

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,800
this isn't something pulled together in

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,599
each html

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,359
or you know some animated uh video this

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,960
is this is real code and so

00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:00,839
arnap uh ammar uh from arna

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,839
uh please uh come join me on our virtual

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,800
stage

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,560
thanks heather and hello everyone we are

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,400
going to start our demo by looking at

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,040
the openshift dashboard

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,200
for the montreal cluster and what we see

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,440
is that there is only one pod running

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,960
it's a database so the cluster is

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,800
virtually empty

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,000
same thing with the deployments we see

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,800
one deployment

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,760
and that's the same database we now

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,839
shift over

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,000
to an experimental gui for the

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,040
kubernetes plugin of the onapp

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,119
project onapp is running

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,760
in a different data center in university

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,599
of new hampshire interoperability lab

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,359
and the two data centers are connected

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,480
over sd-wan

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,280
we are going to start the demo by

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,319
adding a cluster to one app basically

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,400
we're registering

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,400
the openshift cluster we're going to

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,319
call it mtl lab

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,000
and we're going to import a settings

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,880
file to make sure that the openshift

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,599
cluster

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:06,560
gets registered properly with onapp

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,560
we'll give it a label mtl underscore lab

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,200
and next we are going to create a

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,960
composite app

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,359
a composite app is nothing but an

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,599
application with several applications

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,400
underneath it we are going to call it

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,240
ngc

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,960
underscore mtl there is a previously

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,319
created

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,680
composite app just ignore that

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,599
now we are going to create an

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,720
application underneath that composite

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,560
app

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,480
in our case there's only a one-to-one

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,160
association the composite app

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,680
consists of one application that's the

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,760
5g core

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,119
we are going to import the package for

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,800
the 5g core

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,839
which is essentially a helm package

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:54,720
and now we are going to create placement

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:56,480
intent the orchestration is intent based

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,480
and once we have created the generic

00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,280
placement intent we can create the

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,800
specific

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,359
intent for the application underneath

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,839
in this case we are creating an intent

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,839
for the 5g

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
core

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,440
now that we have created the service or

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,200
the composite app

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,640
we can deploy it and this next step

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,040
is exactly that we are going to deploy

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,640
the

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,760
composite app so we are creating a

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,760
deployment intent group

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,839
and next we are going to create a

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,720
specific intent for the 5g core

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,400
where we are going to deploy it onto the

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,520
cluster with the label that we had

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,520
previously created

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,680
okay great so we've deployed the 5g core

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,599
and we go back to the openshift

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,000
dashboard

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,240
and what we see now is instead of one

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,240
part there are 32 pods

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:14,480
there including all the 5g core services

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,480
so the 5g core has come up successfully

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,319
as you know the upf is a pnf

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,720
and this shows you the column management

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,480
interface in addition to the upf

00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,920
it shows the entire software driven

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,640
fabric you can see the different

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,400
interfaces

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,680
n3n4 and six as defined by 3gpp

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,319
and you can see the upf connected via

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,119
set of network elements

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,440
in this dashboard we see more details we

00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:47,839
see details of the n3 interface

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,839
that connects the ram to the upf

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,599
now we are going to do end-to-end

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,640
testing

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,119
this is a gui for a

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,040
ue and genode emulator test tool it's

00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,119
called a bot

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,040
now we have another instance of the 5g

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,880
code running in the unh lab and we are

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,680
actually going to do the testing against

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,160
that

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,119
we are going to run only two tests today

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,160
the first test

00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,280
is ue connection request so that test is

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,359
running right now

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,359
as you see and it passed successfully

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:29,839
the next test we are going to run is a

00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:29,839
ue session establishment

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:43,839
so now this test is running

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,839
and it's so far running successfully

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,920
we're going to see the overall results

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,720
46 tests pass

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,720
none failed and last but not the least

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,720
we are going to see a ladder diagram of

00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,520
all the different interactions between

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,520
the

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,960
gnode b and the different cnfs that

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,200
happened and how

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,720
things passed successfully so this

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,839
concludes our demo

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,839
and now back to you heather

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,480
thanks so much amar for that demo that

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,400
was really great and once again

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,400
yeah as i mentioned before he went into

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,359
it this is real code you were seeing it

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,800
uh here on stage so i really want to to

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,960
thank you for sharing that

00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,240
uh for sharing that with us and then the

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,760
big question is you know this was a

00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,839
great proof of concept

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,520
so you know i hope that we've inspired

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,200
you to want to get involved

00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,760
and so let's talk a little bit about

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,079
what's next and how you can get involved

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,920
so first off you know as i said you know

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,280
we have done this demo in three stages

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,559
the first one we asked ourselves a

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,640
fundamental question

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,400
about the network infrastructure this

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,040
time we asked ourselves a fundamental

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,599
question

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,640
about onap integration and onboarding of

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,400
cnfs

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,119
and the next big question that we want

00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,200
to ask ourselves is to bring in radio

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,720
and ran onboarding into this because

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,119
that really does take it

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,000
to a full system and we really want to

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,520
start engaging with

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,440
network slicing because we know that's

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,960
going to be a really important network

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,839
management technique for all of the

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,359
operators

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,119
going forward out there so if you're

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,000
interested in that phase 3 proof of

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,480
concepting

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,079
please go to this url i often after i

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,960
show these things on stages have people

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,599
come up to me

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,800
and say hey why wasn't i involved can i

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,559
do this in the future

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,839
this is how you get involved it's open

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,000
to everyone this is a

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,000
power of open source please come join us

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and give of your time and resources

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,319
also once again this is a proof of

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,480
concept and we have a number of you know

00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,800
mainline code activities going on

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,480
that impact this in which we leveraged

00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,760
uh to build this demo and that we hope

00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,079
to leverage for building pro

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,040
a future proof of concept so please if

00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,240
you are interested

00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,640
in the direction of cloud native for

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,440
onap please come join the onap technical

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,119
community

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,200
if you are interested in getting

00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,240
involved in the work in opnfv

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,400
or any of our sdn controller projects or

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,680
our data plane projects within lfn

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,839
please you can see

00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,960
all of those projects there at our lf

00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,720
networking

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,640
site so please come join those projects

00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,079
and help us create the actual

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,000
mainline open source code cntt

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,480
is defining the architecture and

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,400
requirements for conformance and for

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,680
overall architecture for cloud native in

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,960
their r2 work stream

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,440
so if you're interested in that and

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,960
you're more of a requirements standards

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,040
or

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,400
specification architect person please

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,280
come join that work

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,119
and then finally you know where the

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,119
rubber hits the road for a lot of us

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,319
is in our compliance and verification

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,440
testing we have an

00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:43,839
entire cloud native ovp stream

00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,119
so you can find information there and

00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,839
then just a shout out to

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,400
our great partners over at cncf without

00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,319
whom

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,599
a lot of this technology would not exist

00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,200
and if you're interested in joining

00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,440
their telecom user working group

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,440
you can see that information as well and

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,280
then i do want to end finally with

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,040
another shout out of thanks to all of

00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,640
our partners who pulled this together

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,400
you can see this is about 12

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,640
organizations here if i'm counting

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,520
correctly i'm doing that in real time so

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,200
might be slightly off but everyone was

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,880
able to come and collaborate across

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,040
their organizational boundaries

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,200
and that is the power of open source

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,800
it's the power of open source projects

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,480
and it is the power of our communities

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,800
that we are able to do this so

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,839
please come collaborate with us and a

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,319
round of applause

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,839
virtually to the folks who did this for

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:29,680
this round uh they gave

00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,200
them their time they gave of themselves

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,040
and they were able to make sure we were

00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,720
able to show this to you today so

00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,640
thanks so much please enjoy the rest of

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,040
o nes please use the opportunity

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,880
to do some virtual networking and head

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,240
to our booth where we've got a version

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,800
of this in the demo

00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,880
in our demo booth for lf networking and

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,079
lf edge pavilion and

00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,079
have a great rest of your show

00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:00,160
all right thank you um heather and amar

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,960
that was fantastic um i think if we were

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,200
in a real

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,880
stage i would have asked you to like run

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,800
a drone or

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,480
uh you know do some virtual reality to

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,559
just show that there's

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,160
sort of the boring stuff in the bottom

00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,680
but that's what matters so

00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,680
thank you very much very exciting

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,200
as i told uh told you in the beginning

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,400
right

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,640
network matters it's critical

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,760
whether it's you know fires here in

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,760
california

00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:33,119
you know hurricanes you know global

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,720
issues uh or even the pandemic and how

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:39,440
patterns change so the next keynote

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,800
is really exciting uh because it's from

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,680
one of the top

00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:49,119
ctos very humble and very visionary

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,480
the cto of atnt um we all know

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,559
and love for his vision uh he oversees

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,520
basically all the engineering the labs

00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,880
foundry

00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,280
et cetera et cetera and uh today i think

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,400
he

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,680
is going to cover how att has

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,599
kind of adapted given the new normal

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,800
but more importantly how the power of

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,480
open source has

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:19,839
allowed them to not lose a heartbeat so

00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,839
without further ado welcome andre huge

00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:24,539
[Music]

00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,240
thanks r pitt i'm happy to be here

00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,720
virtually with all of you today

00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,920
you know covid19 has without a doubt

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,839
changed the world

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,760
the engines of commerce and the rhythms

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,040
of our daily lives have been flipped on

00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,839
their heads

00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,480
but one thing has remained unchanged

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,319
that's att's commitment to keeping our

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,040
customers connected

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,400
and the work we do at a t is critical to

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,599
millions of people

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,280
businesses and first responders no

00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,240
pressure right

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,359
you know six months into covid and i am

00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,680
really proud to say

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,720
that our network was stood the test of

00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,720
time

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,960
moving the american workforce out of

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,119
busy metropolitan buildings

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,520
and transitioning to supporting them

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,800
from their new home-based offices

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,720
that are far more widespread and while

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,200
we didn't see covid coming and i don't

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,520
think anyone could have honestly

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,599
what we've done to build and invest in

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,280
our network over the past several years

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:34,319
paid dividends during this

00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:37,280
crisis we've invested more than 135

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,079
billion dollars over the past five years

00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,280
in our u s

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:44,160
infrastructure to build a robust network

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,200
with self-healing architectures and open

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,839
standards

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,960
that helped us get as ready as we could

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,800
for this unforeseen moment in history

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,640
i'll get into these open standards a

00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,599
little bit later

00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,200
but first when it comes to our network

00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,280
even without covid

00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,319
we were carrying more data than ever

00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,280
before

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,119
in fact our global network carries more

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,760
than

00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:13,359
393 petabytes of data traffic

00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,319
on an average day that's up 20 percent

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:17,760
compared to pre-pandemic figures which

00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,760
you can see depicted

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,119
in this chart on the left-hand side of

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,079
the screen

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,160
as you can tell there was a major spike

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,079
once coveted hit in the u.s

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:31,440
and the majority of american workers

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,359
began shifting to a work from home model

00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,880
and we don't expect that growth to slow

00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,200
anytime soon

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,559
with americans continuing to work in

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,319
school from home

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,920
we anticipate these numbers will

00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,040
continue to rise

00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,119
meaning more demand for our network

00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,359
making it all the more critical that we

00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,359
continue to get it right

00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,720
here are just a few more data points i'd

00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,839
like to call out

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,880
that help illustrate how in demand our

00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:01,280
network has been

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:04,559
in covid times first text messaging

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,599
during the pandemic customers have twice

00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:10,160
set a record for text messaging during

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,520
the march spring break time frame and on

00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,720
easter weekend

00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:18,559
people sent more than 23 000

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:22,400
texts per second across the att network

00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,359
the previous p pre pandemic was about 15

00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,640
000 texts

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:29,040
per second that's an increase of over 53

00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,440
percent in peak times

00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:34,559
now on the voice network wireless voice

00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:37,760
usage has soared in the past six months

00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,680
with a nearly 40 percent increase as

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,079
people began to work from home

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,960
and use their mobile devices to attend

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,359
meetings and connect with colleagues

00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,520
now on the mobile data side and this

00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:51,839
might be surprising to some

00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,799
mobile data volume has slightly

00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:56,319
decreased

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:58,480
during the covid19 since many people are

00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,040
able to connect their smartphones to

00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,119
their home

00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:05,359
wi-fi throughout the day i'd be remiss

00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,359
not to mention the first responders who

00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,480
are the true heroes of the past six

00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,880
months

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,400
i can't imagine what it's like to drive

00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,400
to work every day

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,400
knowing your health and quite frankly

00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,720
your life is on the line

00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,000
and a t has a stake in our first

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,240
responders

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,520
we built a whole separate network

00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,839
dedicated to them

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,520
it's called firstnet and thanks to

00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,640
unique benefits like dedicated

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,799
connectivity

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,839
when needed always on priority and

00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,640
preemption

00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,359
and high quality band 14 spectrum

00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,200
firstnet

00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,880
is one of the fastest commercial

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,799
networks out there

00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,480
with more than one and a half million

00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,640
connections on firstnet

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,720
we're seeing first responders consume

00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,520
more than twice as much data

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,000
as general consumers reinforcing the

00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:55,760
need and importance of having a network

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,640
purpose built for public safety our at t

00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,599
network has

00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,000
been able to withstand the unprecedented

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,880
new normal demands during covid

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,720
thanks to the investments we've made and

00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,319
the behind the scenes work we've put

00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,720
into our open initiatives

00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,960
in the past decade now the

00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,920
virtualization of our network

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,960
includes our sdn controls is the

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,920
foundation

00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,000
of everything we do open source

00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,680
technology is a major part of this

00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,319
foundation

00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,200
what's more the advances we've made in

00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,559
cloud native virtualization

00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,559
containerization and hardware and

00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,119
software disaggregation

00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,839
allowed us to reach our software-based

00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,920
networking goal of 75 percent

00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,359
several months ahead of schedule this

00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,680
year

00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,720
having a much more software-centric

00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,280
network enables us to respond rapidly

00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:52,000
to any new demand on the network even

00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,160
those caused by worldwide pandemics

00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,359
let me walk you through a few examples

00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,640
of this

00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:00,880
wi-fi calling voice over wi-fi was a

00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,720
hundred percent virtualized prior to

00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,040
covid19

00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,799
that's thanks to the work we began

00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,520
earlier in 2019

00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,960
when we began to roll out in production

00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,599
our own deployment

00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,480
of the virtualized evolved data packet

00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,359
gateway

00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,640
these functions run on openstack on our

00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:21,760
network cloud

00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,799
and uses onap for orchestration and data

00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,200
analytics our engineering and operations

00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:28,319
team

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,880
also use this suite of open source based

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,720
tools to monitor that production

00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,400
and i'm so thankful for the work we've

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,040
put into this platform

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,040
before the pandemic because what we saw

00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,160
in the first few months of the covid

00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,359
crisis

00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,960
is that wi-fi calling peaked over 105

00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,920
percent

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,160
and averaged 90 percent higher than

00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,160
pre-covered levels

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,280
not surprisingly the average call

00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,440
duration was over

00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,440
75 percent longer than pre-covet

00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,000
the virtualization of this service

00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,400
allowed us to maintain the control

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,480
and connection levels our customers have

00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,640
come to expect

00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,520
in comparison to the network five years

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,280
ago

00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,359
what would have taken us weeks and

00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,559
months to add this amount of additional

00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,440
capacity

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,640
it now takes us minutes and hours thanks

00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,960
to the virtualization of our network

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,760
now let's talk about our global sd-wan

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,400
service

00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,079
another great example of how the network

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,680
responded to covid

00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:34,079
in att's global sd-wan

00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,400
this service allows any of our

00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:39,200
enterprise customer employees to

00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,920
access their private corporate network

00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,960
from home or any remote location

00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:48,240
using ordinary broadband access

00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,960
and as most of us saw early on in covid

00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,799
and even still today home access to

00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,240
those private corporate networks is

00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:57,040
essential

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,520
there was a dramatic increase in usage

00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,400
of these services during the covet 19

00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,160
spread

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,119
in asia pacific emea and the united

01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,400
states

01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:12,480
this was a 16 x demand surge

01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:15,040
compared to the average usage in 2019

01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,799
again the virtualization of this service

01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,280
allowed us to dynamically

01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:20,480
increase our capacity to meet the

01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,760
surging demand

01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,799
in weeks let's talk a bit about mobile

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,000
messaging

01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:30,880
as mentioned earlier at t experienced

01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,359
three years of text messaging growth in

01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,720
just

01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,880
one week we moved messaging traffic from

01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,920
our legacy infrastructure to our cloud

01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,240
infrastructure

01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:44,559
to assist offload and help this demand

01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,440
our software-enabled network allowed us

01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,720
to add more than

01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,240
60 capacity to our message platform in

01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,799
one day

01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,720
as you can see from these examples

01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:58,000
that's the power of having an

01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:00,799
open software centric network

01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,119
it enables a much more agile dynamic

01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,440
network that can elastically scale to

01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,599
meet our customers demands

01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,480
i'd like to also share some updates on a

01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,880
few other open source initiatives

01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,640
last fall att announced that it had

01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,960
submitted its design for

01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,000
several open disaggregated routing

01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,880
platforms

01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,040
to the open compute project these

01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,240
designs were based on the broadcom

01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,280
jericho 2 chip and their flexible

01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:32,480
distributed disaggregated chassis

01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,000
design which can gracefully scale from 4

01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,119
terabits per second

01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,920
to 192 terabits per second

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,319
i'm proud to announce today that we have

01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,520
now

01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:45,680
deployed a next generation ip mpls

01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,960
core routing platform into our

01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,319
production network

01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,880
based on this open hardware we chose a

01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,839
disruptive supplier drive nets to

01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,000
provide

01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:58,079
the network operating system software

01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,319
for this core use case

01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,920
the drive net software supports a

01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:04,400
sophisticated set

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,400
of traffic engineering features that

01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,520
provides highly reliable

01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,440
and efficient mpls transport

01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,680
in the coming weeks we'll announce

01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,240
additional software suppliers

01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,720
for other use cases operating on the

01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,599
same

01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,400
exact hardware this will truly

01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,599
demonstrate

01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:26,000
the power of openness our deployment of

01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,039
these new open disaggregated routing

01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,200
platforms

01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,880
is coupled with the deployment of our

01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,559
next-gen long-haul

01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,880
400 gig optical transport platform

01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,880
this combination of networking platform

01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,920
is exactly what we need

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,240
to transport the tsunami of demand that

01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,400
will be generated by our 5g

01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,880
fiber-based broadband and entertainment

01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,039
content services

01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,160
another great project out there is

01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:56,240
airship

01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:59,760
this is att's 5g cloud infrastructure

01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,440
and is enabled by airship and cncf

01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,880
which is the cloud native computing

01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,559
foundation

01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,240
att contributed airship a purpose-built

01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:11,200
high-performance network cloud

01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:15,359
infrastructure integrating over 14

01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:19,039
cncf projects att's network cloud has

01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:21,599
over 315 deployments here to date

01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,119
airship enables fast deployments at

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,760
scale with a hundred percent

01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,000
consistency ensuring the network is

01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,559
operational and secure

01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,559
we expect by the end of next year

01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,760
airship 2 will become generally

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,400
available

01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,359
this product will offer a simplified

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,680
solution

01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:41,280
with a reduced footprint improved

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,599
security posture

01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,200
and expanding its industry-leading bare

01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,359
metal provisioning to include

01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,880
multi-cloud and multi-cluster

01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:52,079
capabilities

01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,680
now let's move on to o-rand the open

01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,559
radio access network

01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,200
alliance and open source community

01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,720
released

01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:03,440
its second bronze release in june

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,200
at t has made significant contributions

01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,280
to seed this community

01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:12,240
with over 1.3 million lines of code

01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,680
contributed to date of course all of

01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,319
this momentum needs to

01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,880
ultimately drive operator deployments

01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,960
and validations in the real world

01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,640
to that end we have successfully

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,520
concluded the second

01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,280
live trial of an open source based

01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,319
real-time intelligent controller

01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,960
platform

01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:32,480
in our 5g network in the new york new

01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,119
jersey area

01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,839
this trial validated a key assumption

01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,359
underlying

01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,680
oran's vision that is a near real-time

01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:44,240
closed-loop control of the ram through

01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:46,720
an open e-2 interface

01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,160
this paves the way to drive an open

01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,799
architecture

01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,799
that significantly optimizes network

01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:56,640
resource utilization

01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,200
and customer experience and last but not

01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,000
least

01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,280
we have the collective power of the onap

01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,680
community

01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,680
one recent example delivered by the onap

01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,240
project is smart launch

01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,039
smart launch is an onap based control

01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,200
loop solution that automates the lte

01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,520
carrier launch process

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,359
it eliminates vendor-based carrier

01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,799
launch work and reduces internal

01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:21,599
workloads

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,000
in addition smart launch uses machine

01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,799
learning

01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,400
to automatically determine parameter

01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:28,240
configurations

01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,480
smart launch has been used to bring

01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:35,039
approximately 450 carriers online

01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,640
once adopted nationwide it will support

01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:40,240
upwards of 65

01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:42,640
000 launches per year so many exciting

01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,799
open source projects have helped the att

01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,920
network handle this tsunami

01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:49,920
of data the pandemic has created

01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,280
i want to thank all of the open source

01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,640

just to make sure that you know we are

01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:40,240
on time and moving forward

01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,559
uh again standardized to east coast time

01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,359
but let's talk about the next keynote

01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,039
and this is very exciting because

01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:49,200
these are two foundations within the

01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:52,400
linux foundation cncf

01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,000

and i'm so happy we are collaborating in

01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:54,160
so many different ways

01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,359
so today as artpit said i'll be talking

01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,559
a lot about

01:07:55,359 --> 01:08:01,440
how we are working to bring kubernetes

01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,839
bring a cloud native to telcos and the

01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,599
edge

01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:05,520
but i'd like to paint it in a larger

01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,240
picture of what i think

01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,520
is the second wave of cloud native so

01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,880
i'm going to be moving slides and

01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:15,200
talking so

01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,799
hang in there so this is my agenda today

01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,400
i'm going as i said we'll talk a little

01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:20,480
bit about the cloud native story and

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,080
what our drivers of success have been

01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,600
and then go into the second wave of

01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,319
cloud native where we are so tightly

01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,040
coupled

01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:29,040
uh coupled is the wrong word so tightly

01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,120
integrating and working closely

01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,960
with linux foundation networking and

01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,600
provide you with some tidbits of what's

01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,239
going on

01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,920
and then share some other sessions that

01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:39,279
you can go to to get more detailed

01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,440
information

01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:44,000
so just a little bit about myself i am

01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:46,000
the general manager for cncf as arpat

01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,960
mentioned and i have a long history with

01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,719
cloud native

01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,560
i got involved with the foundation in

01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,159
the very beginning with the third

01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,880
project that joined it called open

01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:55,040
tracing

01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,799
so as a project contributor i spent a

01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,600
lot of time with end users in the

01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,080
community

01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,440
discussing technology topics around

01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,480
observability of

01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,120
large-scale distributed systems my topic

01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,759
of the day

01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,600
in that time was distributed tracing uh

01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:12,880
and that remains close to my heart and

01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,120
i'm sorry for being such a dork um but

01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,799
um and from there as a as arpat

01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,799
mentioned i worked at gitlab again

01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:19,040
focused on cloud native and now here i

01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,279
am

01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,279
it really feels like a coming of home

01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,000
for me to be in this role to be working

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,040
alongside

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,560
all of you just fyi for us to keep in

01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,040
touch beyond this keynote

01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,120
i spend way too much time on twitter and

01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,640
that's my handle so you can reach me at

01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,159
any time my

01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,279
direct messages are open and you can

01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:39,279
directly tweet me there

01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:47,279
so first things first i have to say

01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:50,000
huge could happen congratulations to

01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:52,400
opnfv and cntt for joining this is

01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,400
great for the community clarity

01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,080
consistency and camaraderie these are

01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,640
the three things i see

01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,159
when i hear about the merger i think it

01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,440
will make things much more clear for

01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:04,159
people on how to

01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:06,000
um move forward it'll be more consistent

01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,719
and we'll all do it with camaraderie

01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,520
having fun

01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,080
along the way congratulations arpit

01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,679
heather

01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,679
and everybody else involved

01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,400
so let's talk a little bit about the

01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,480
cloud native story

01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,080
kubernetes changed the industry very

01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,560
fast we all know that i mean this

01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:26,719
foundation started in 2015

01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,840
and here we are five years later with so

01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,480
much growth

01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,640
uh the blue line you see over here is

01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,239
the growth of kubernetes in the google

01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,600
search tones which is a great

01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,800
um sort of uh canary or bellwether of

01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:44,159
what's going on in the ecosystem

01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,840
we have 70 plus projects in cncf and

01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:47,360
the number is growing which is really

01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,760
exciting for us because we want to

01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,640
provide a neutral ip zone where people

01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,440
can come together

01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,880
collaborate and make the best technology

01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,120
of the many projects

01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,000
the graduated and incubated projects

01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,719
have meant stringent

01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,600
requirements and have extensive end user

01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,880
communities

01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,360
which help them be a standard in their

01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,320
uh well standard is a tricky word but

01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,880
help them be

01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:13,440
a mainstay in their respective

01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,520
technology communities

01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,920
we have a lot of members as you all know

01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,960
and all the world's hyperscalers

01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,960
are part of our membership they're

01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,480
end users around the world and we cover

01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,520
multiple geographies

01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,080
we are a truly global community of doers

01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,080
we are

01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,440
cloud native which is the community of

01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:35,120
doers

01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:37,440
um only this one go next

01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,840
huh sorry just figuring out my slides

01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,840
here

01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:46,000
um apologies

01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,920
so for some reason i don't see the

01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,880
slides updating on the big screen here

01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,880
but they are updating when i move them

01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,400
so i'm going to hope that that is

01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:58,400
happening well

01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,440
um we have the ecosystem accelerating at

01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:03,199
all times

01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,000
and right now we have over 145 end user

01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,080
companies

01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,400
end users are the mainstay of cloud

01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,400
native and they are joining us in droves

01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,800
there's a lot of movement in our

01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,520
ecosystem in terms of

01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,880
uh people getting acquired big companies

01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,800
finding value and

01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,719
having cloud native companies join them

01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,360
to offer more

01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:27,040
distributed systems oriented offerings

01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,800
um i'd like to take a quick second here

01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,520
and double check that folks are able to

01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,120
see

01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:37,840
my the correct slide that i have on um

01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,840
can someone let me know

01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,920
so the slide that should be there is

01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:51,440
about

01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:53,199
acceleration of the ecosystem

01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,840
all right i got a message that said good

01:12:53,199 --> 01:13:00,080
to go so i'm gonna keep going

01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,080
thank you for your patience everyone

01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,719
all right so what have been the drivers

01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,239
of success for cloud native we have

01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,840
lots of members we have lots of people

01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,719
in the community who work hard and work

01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,640
together

01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:17,040
well number one i would say is our focus

01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,000
on open governance it is our point of

01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,239
view that

01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,120
with open governance a project makes

01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:25,600
sure that no one single entity controls

01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,880
the story of what happens it's also more

01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,480
secure because

01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,239
depending on changing business

01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,440
priorities of one single company a

01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,239
project will not

01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,040
go up or down multiple people are

01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:37,440
stakeholders

01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,320
and projects have their own rights to

01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:42,000
decide

01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:44,320
how they structure this open governance

01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
a really big piece i would say is giving

01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,920
end users a formal role

01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,920
cloud native computing foundation is

01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,920
about end user driven open source and

01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,080
our end users participate with

01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,840
a clear structure they have working

01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,360
groups and sigs where they give feedback

01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,920
directly to the technical oversight

01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,600
committee

01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,199
they participate in the governing order

01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,960
they are they are

01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,800
present everywhere and we are taking

01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,120
feedback working alongside them

01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,719
and sometimes they even collaborate and

01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:11,840
send in projects of their own

01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:14,239
such as uh what we recently got with uh

01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,880
backstage from spotify and tremor from

01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:17,440
wayfair

01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,640
these are brand new projects compared to

01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,760
envoy from lyft

01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,760
and jaeger from uber which are all

01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,840
end user companies developing great

01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,080
software and collaborate giving back to

01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,800
the ecosystem

01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,280
so another factor that kind of combines

01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,719
to that

01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,960
is that we allow for project

01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,640
experimentation i just told you we have

01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,880
70 plus projects now

01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,080
and that is a key part of our strategy

01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,920
we do not pick

01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,120
we are not king makers we do not pick a

01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,600
winner instead

01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,520
we qualify technology to keep moving

01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:51,120
through our graduation requirements

01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:53,199
and that alone is the uh

01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,880
is the marker that end users need to

01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,800
decide what to use and what not to use

01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,640
and there's lots of lots of innovation

01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,800
happening at sandbox and even higher

01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:03,440
levels

01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,640
we're a global community lots of people

01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,640
from lots of countries

01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,480
our events that are thank you to all of

01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,159
events we've been able to run in various

01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,440
continents have brought on people from

01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:14,080
asia back europe

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:16,400
americas and smaller in on a smaller

01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:19,199
scale from latin america and africa

01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,640
and it will only keep growing covet or

01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:24,080
no covet because

01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,520
thankfully we have a virtual option now

01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,760
what's going to be the case moving

01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,159
forward well let me tell you that we

01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,440
will always be the foundation of doers

01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,679
that focuses on

01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:35,440
end user driven open source we are

01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,920
helping developers

01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,440
go through up level their skills we're

01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,560
helping them with training with

01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,480
certifications

01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,880
and we plan to continue enabling the

01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,239
ecosystem right like that

01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,239
at the end of the day a lot of

01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:49,280
innovation happens here and we aim to

01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:52,640
make that

01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:55,280
stay the case for a long time to come

01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:59,040
so with all that good news let me talk

01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,040
about the second wave of cloud native

01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,640
interestingly the second wave is has

01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,400
been propelled in some ways by the

01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,199
impact of the coronavirus

01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:09,199
as we heard from andre's amazing keynote

01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:12,000
just a few minutes ago

01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:13,760
the volume of activity online is

01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,360
increasing they had so many more text

01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,280
messages they had so many long

01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,040
so much longer phone calls happening

01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,480
similarly web scale companies are seeing

01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,960
that much more traffic

01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,719
um workflows that used to be offline are

01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,480
now online and that just leads to people

01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,320
needing more compute power

01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,159
with more cloud computing comes more

01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,080
cloud native and we have seen tremendous

01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:34,960
growth

01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,800
with growth comes there comes complexity

01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,440
security is just as important if not

01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,440
more so

01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,520
in this current environment and the rise

01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,400
of devsecops is in the second wave of

01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,239
cloud native

01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,000
when you think of devops that's

01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,880
developers and operations coming closer

01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,280
together

01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,239
and devsecops is the same thing but with

01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,640
security

01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,920
now things are where things are where

01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,679
people collaborate whether they're

01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,560
developers security professionals or

01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,640
operations

01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,159
we are breaking silos because that is

01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:04,880
the way to go when you are modernizing

01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:06,400
the multi-cloud needs are also growing a

01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,400
lot and are part of the second wave of

01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,679
cloud native as amol mentioned in his

01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,679
talk

01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:13,760
multi-cloud is the way to go one

01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:16,000
specific provider cannot service all

01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,480
needs and we have to be ready to support

01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,080
with kubernetes as the platform layer

01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,400
how people are going to

01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,760
uh manage workloads across different

01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,000
clouds with different kinds of

01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,800
technology stacks etc

01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,800
and then finally which the point that

01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,199
probably relates most to all of you

01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,080
is the proliferation of 5g and edge

01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,840
devices

01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,480
this is all part of the future as we

01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,480
move forward

01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,960
so i'm going to double down on to the

01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,880
topic of telcos and the edge for us

01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,880
in this for the purposes of this keynote

01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,640
the telcos are going cloud native for

01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,000
some very simple straightforward

01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,040
business reasons

01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,960
um everybody needs improved resiliency

01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:03,600
they want availability they want to ship

01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,280
faster and better at the same time and

01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,239
telcos are no exception

01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,239
um there's a higher demand for something

01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,719
that is multi-cloud and works across the

01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:14,159
board

01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:16,320
there are so many reasons by for which

01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:20,080
telcos are moving to cloud native and i

01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,080
have to say good choice you all

01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:25,920
now as we think about

01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,600
why kubernetes has been the catalyst for

01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,520
this move that you are now making it's

01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,400
because of the way it's architected

01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:36,320
it is extremely evolvable it's extremely

01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,320
extendable and very resilient

01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:42,080
so when we think in the telco world um

01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,679
how does kubernetes how can kubernetes

01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,920
play the biggest role

01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,360
well let's talk about cloud native

01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,440
network functions

01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,280
heather and arpa have both brought

01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,760
brought them brought them up already so

01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,840
i

01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,880
i believe that you have a baseline of

01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,719
interpretation

01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,640
but at the end of the day a cloud native

01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,840
network function is built on cloud

01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:03,199
native principles

01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:08,719
with microservices with a resiliency and

01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:12,480
decoupled architecture baked in

01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,480
now i apologize sorry

01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:20,560
i apologize my keynote slides are just

01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,560
kind of messing it up a little bit

01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,640
um

01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,400
now there's various reasons for us to

01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,320
think about how we're going to do

01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:30,560
do things moving forward and this

01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,880
keynote is by no means meant to be

01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,000
uh the definitive stance of it exactly

01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,840
what's going to happen this space is

01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,440
very evolving and we're working closely

01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,679
with linux foundation networking

01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,440
to define the answers but let us talk a

01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,199
little bit about best practices

01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,440
arbit shared this diagram with you and i

01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:47,280
think it's extremely helpful for folks

01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,199
as they think about the architecture

01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,239
when it changes from virtual networking

01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:53,040
functions to cloud

01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:54,400
cloud native networking functions this

01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,080
keynote is not meant to go in the

01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,280
details as i said but i am going to

01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,960
leave you with some

01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,960
information that you can look at in the

01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,480
slides later on about

01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:06,320
what can be you know branded as a cnf

01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,560
but may not meet the requirements of all

01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,159
you amazing companies trying to

01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,920
service your customers with the best

01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,920
cloud native technology

01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,040
it is in all of our best interests to

01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,199
avoid the pitfalls

01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,719
of the not so great cloud native network

01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:21,360
functions

01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,520
and the lfn plus cncf promise to you is

01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,320
that we will bring you a gold standard

01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,520
cnf

01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,920
that will have the right properties of

01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:32,480
observability of resiliency of

01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,360
visibility and help you get the job done

01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,560
keeping in mind

01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:39,280
as heather said the very complex uh

01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,719
tech software story that telcos have

01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,639
because they've been

01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:46,400
technology companies for a lot longer

01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:48,560
than many of us have even existed

01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,560
this cnf is always going to be based on

01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,760
the kubernetes conformance program which

01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,560
makes sure that

01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,239
anything using kubernetes is certified

01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,400
to be

01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,520
meeting the base requirements that make

01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,880
it the same

01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:04,480
as the main kubernetes project

01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,320
and i'm really excited that we'll work

01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:08,239
together to make sure that happens and

01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,520
any certification etc that comes out of

01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,520
elephant cncf

01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,520
will be based on this there are many

01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,960
certified kubernetes providers out there

01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:19,120
already so we have

01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:22,080
uh good best practices to look at

01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:23,120
at the end of the day watch the space

01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,120
for more on

01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:29,040
conformance and certifications coming

01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:31,120
soon your way

01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,120
now let's talk very briefly about cloud

01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:35,120
native on the edge

01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,960
devices are proliferating everywhere

01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:39,600
whether it's a smartphone smart car

01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,199
smart lawnmower smart oven smart

01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,320
everything is everywhere

01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:46,080
and iot and edge is critical as we move

01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,719
forward with the number of devices that

01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:50,960
will be

01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:53,280
um technology based and needing to have

01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,719
specif have cloud native workflows that

01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,800
work on the edge

01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,040
to that and kubernetes is here to

01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,159
support we have projects within cncf

01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,880
such as cube edge

01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,360
and uh cooper that are going to help

01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,600
with

01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:07,840
this transition kubej is working with a

01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,840
crano project in lfn for example

01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,520
and you can rest assured that a lot of

01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,800
cncf projects are making lots of

01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,239
progress to help

01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:18,560
edge deployments be cloud native

01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,920
if you want to learn more about this i

01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,520
would recommend

01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,320
attending this session later this

01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,159
afternoon which is a tutorial where

01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:28,320
multiple cloud native projects are going

01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:30,639
to present on how exactly

01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,760
they are working to help edge

01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,520
technologies

01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,679
this tutorial i think starts in two

01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,320
hours i'll be giving a brief talk there

01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,360
with

01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:42,239
my colleague taylor carpenter who has

01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,760
spent a lot of sweat equity figuring out

01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,840
all the details about cloud native

01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,520
network functions with like conformance

01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,760
and certification and we work all very

01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,280
closely with lfn

01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,360
so it'll be good for you to hear from

01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,440
him he'll have folks the logos that are

01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:58,239
present on the presented on the slides

01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:59,760
are folks that'll be there sharing how

01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,960
edge deployments are using their

01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,040
technologies

01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,400
so it should be very informative and i

01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:08,880
highly highly recommend that you join

01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,560
in addition uh on wednesday there's

01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,920
going to be a bunch of

01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,120
um in addition there's going to be a

01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,920
bunch of uh

01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,040

01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,239
wednesday about

01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:23,360
cncf efforts in the telco world so

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:26,639
there's going to be

01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,920
a telco user group cnf testbed and

01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,600
conformance test suite

01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,000
it's going to be on wednesday september

01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,560
30 at 1 45 pm eastern

01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,719
and there is also a birds of a feather

01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,760
that is later in that same day

01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:42,080
so highly recommend uh digging deeper

01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,000
going into the details because

01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,679
as technology evolves the beginning

01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,080
building blocks are always about the

01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:52,080
details and i highly encourage us all to

01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:55,679
take a deeper look with all that said

01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:57,920
i would like to thank arpith heather and

01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,440
everybody on the linux foundation and

01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,239
linux foundation networking and edge

01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,840
groups for

01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:04,159
collaborating with us for partnering

01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,239
with us and bringing cloud native

01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:08,400
to telcos and the edge this is the

01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:10,080
future as i've already mentioned

01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,239
this is part of the second wave of cloud

01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:14,400
native we're all just beginning

01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:15,679

software defined is going to drive the

01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:09,840
digital infrastructure

01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,000
all the way from edge to cloud so

01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:27,840
without further

01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:27,840

gotten great feedback from our previous

01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:57,840
events that allow

01:28:54,159 --> 01:29:00,639
uh communication between uh attendees

to experts

01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,000
and you know highlight some of the most

01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,280
important things

01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,400
uh that you have or concerns you know

01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,880
this is this is a again a community

01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,679
driven

01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,639
show and it is for the community by the

01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:21,440
community

01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:22,320
and so uh you know you got to you can

01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:25,760
ask anything

01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:28,880
you can get to anybody this is not

01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:32,000
a marketing pitch that's going on

01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:34,639
so given that what i also want to

01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,679
summarize from these sessions today that

01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:39,040
you looked at

01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:41,199
is we have a great set of

01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,320
uh technologies that we have built on

01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:45,199
we've solved some

01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:46,880
major problems uh in the industry right

01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:48,880
when it comes to collaboration

01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,960
priyanka emphasized the power of

01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,639
collaboration and doing

01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,280
so if you're not already you know

01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:56,000
members of linux foundation or lfn or

01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:59,520
any of these

01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:02,000
uh fundamental organization

01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,719
the power of shared investment that

01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,560
creates

01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:10,880
technology for your use is significant

01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:14,000
meanwhile also note that the

01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,280
end users which in a telco world are

01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,520
operators

01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:19,199
in an iot and an edge world are from

01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,600
different verticals whether it's

01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:23,840
healthcare whether it's manufacturing

01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:26,560
which by the way is a significant driver

01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,440
of edge deployments and especially in

01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:31,120
the constrained

01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:34,400
iiot environment if you look at

01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:37,600
retail all of those

01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:40,400
end users are being extremely uh

01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,960
aggressive in deploying open source so

01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,159
again

01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:47,120
please participate uh and i believe

01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:49,199
are we ready to try justin again if

01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:53,679
hopefully we have debugged in real time

01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:53,679
i'm gonna pause uh right

01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:06,239
okay am i good to go

01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,239

hope you're all well and healthy

01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,360
and i'm grateful to the linux foundation

01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,159
for inviting me back to speak at this

01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,000
great event

01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:19,840
which for the first time is held

01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,040
virtually this year due to the ongoing

01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,960
pandemic

01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,719
this is a great community that i've seen

01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,320
grow and expand over the years and i

01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,199
wish we could have all been together in

01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,360
person

01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:31,360
today i'm connecting from home though

01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,120
thanks to technology and the underlying

01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,639
digital infrastructure supporting these

01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:37,040
collaborative tools for a global

01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:40,800
audience this is as good as it gets and

01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:43,199
feels almost as real as meeting a person

01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,719
before we start i wanted to also thank

01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:46,159
my colleagues at econics who helped me

01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,239
with this presentation

01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:49,360
so today i will talk about some of our

01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:51,440
longer term vision

01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,600
as well as the work that our teams do

01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:55,600
every day to help our customers build

01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:59,840
digital infrastructure from

01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,840
the edge to cloud at software speed

01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:05,040
so let me go to the next slide

01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:11,280
okay so first i will say a few words

01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,440
about who we are and then

01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,960
talk about an architecture approach for

01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,400
end-to-end software-defined

01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,639
infrastructure

01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,600
um i will then follow on with two use

01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,400
cases of

01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:24,639
distributed hybrid multi-cloud namely 5g

01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,560
and mobile edge and distributed ai

01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,159
and finally i will touch upon some of

01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,040
our involvement in the open source

01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,880
community

01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:34,239
and our collaboration efforts within

01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:37,360
five gm edge ecosystems

01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:37,360
so who is equinix

01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:43,440
equinix was founded in the early days of

01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,400
internet and our founders put a lot of

01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,120
careful thought

01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:49,199
into the eco equinix name which still

01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:51,840
stands for what we have always

01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:53,679
offered equal access neutrality and

01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,960
interconnection

01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,080
and our logo the fortress symbolizes a

01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,520
stronghold

01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,840
where assets both physical and digital

01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:05,199
are

01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,199
guarded and interconnected

01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,280
when echonyx was founded some 20 years

01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,280
ago

01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:13,280
the internet was having trouble scaling

01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:15,840
and we succeeded in getting

01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:17,920
major network providers to come to our

01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,560
platform to build their infrastructure

01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,080
and interconnect together to really help

01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,719
scale internet

01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:25,280
and then content providers soon followed

01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,320
to get

01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,280
better access to broadband consumers and

01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,840
today

01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,320
all of the five were all five of the

01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,840
world's

01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:37,199
largest websites use equinix and then we

01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,679
saw the growth of the financial

01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:41,360
ecosystem as the stock market moved from

01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:44,080
manual to electronic trading

01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:45,920
where every millisecond matters equinix

01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,760
is now in the words to any leading

01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,639
financial markets

01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,320
next cloud service providers began to

01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,960
populate our ecosystem

01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,760
and today our platform delivers over 40

01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,760
percent

01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:03,199
of cloud on-ramp connectivity globally

01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,480
and we continue to see a continued

01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:06,560
growth of the

01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:08,480
enterprise ecosystem on our platform

01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,639
because of the digital transformation

01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:13,520
that is happening in every industry

01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:15,199
so if you buy groceries online use a

01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,679
video conferencing app

01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:19,280
stream videos or do electronic payments

01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:22,080
chances are that

01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:23,920
we are enabling you to do so as the

01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,400
digital infrastructure underneath the

01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,400
covers

01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:32,320
today we have over 210 data centers

01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,239
globally and we have built

01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,000
a global software defined network to

01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:38,000
connect our locations together

01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,840
almost 10 000 customers are

01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,080
interconnecting directly and privately

01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,880
using our platform with no other network

01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:46,239
provider

01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:49,040
involved some 370

01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:50,080
000 times we support the bulk of the

01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,480
global internet

01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:55,199
traffic exchange and we have a number of

01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:57,520
edge solutions including nfp based edge

01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:59,199
networking capabilities as well as bare

01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,800
metal as a service with a recent

01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:03,520
acquisition of packet

01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,000
and these capabilities today are api

01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,320
based

01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,040
and can be orchestrated and delivered as

01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:10,719
a service

01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,719
with a pay-as-you-go model

01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:16,159
one of the many things that the global

01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:19,280
pandemic has brought to light is the

01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:21,760
importance of digital infrastructure

01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,880
and the new york stock exchange opened

01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,719
in march without

01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,639
its trading floor for the first time in

01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,320
over 200 years

01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:30,080
and for the history of economics that i

01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:32,800
covered earlier because the financial

01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:35,040
ecosystem is predominantly digital today

01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:37,280
the floor closure itself had little if

01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,320
any impact on the operation of the 28

01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,040
trillion dollar

01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:42,000
stock market and during these uncertain

01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,760
times we are also

01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,760
seeing that a wide range of

01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,360
collaboration and productivity

01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:50,000
applications that have played an

01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:52,320
essential role in business continuity

01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,119
are experiencing explosive demand in

01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,080
some cases

01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:57,280
30x growth and these applications are

01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,119
expanding the reach

01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,400
as well as their cloud and co-location

01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:02,880
server capacity

01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,600
to be able to serve customers and remote

01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,600
workers

01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,719
and zoom being a great example of such

01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:10,560
applications leveraging equinix

01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:12,080
but beyond these examples as

01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,000
applications are deployed in an

01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:16,159
increasingly distributed fashion

01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,440
they rely even more on infrastructure

01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:20,400
that can support

01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,719
and offer self-provisioning auto scaling

01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,280
and

01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:25,360
self-healing capabilities and we believe

01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,840
that the only way to deliver these at

01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:29,199
scale

01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,199
is through software

01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:33,679
so how do we make sure that our view of

01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,840
a software defined infrastructure can

01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:39,280
keep pace with evolving technologies and

01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:42,000
customer needs

01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:43,440
first and foremost we believe that our

01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,360
infrastructure is getting

01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:48,159
deployed in a more and more distributed

01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:51,520
way from the edge to cloud

01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:53,840
and what we're trying to enable is to

01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:56,639
make sure that developers can focus

01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,119
on developing code and shipping their

01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,639
code

01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:01,040
and not worry about the specific aspects

01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:02,800
of

01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:05,280
managing and deploying hybrid

01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,920
multi-cloud but we are also seeing that

01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,199
increasingly our customers are looking

01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,199
at their options

01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:12,960
in order to build the best of the breed

01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,159
infrastructure from components from

01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,719
hybrid

01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:17,440
on-prem and color kind of infrastructure

01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:19,600
as well as

01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:21,199
selection of a number of capabilities

01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:24,320
from different clouds

01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:25,440
but also we're saying that in order to

01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:27,840
achieve this vision

01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:30,719
we need to have capabilities that really

01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:33,199
provide a global visibility and control

01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:34,800
plane and orchestration capabilities to

01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:36,159
manage this end-to-end

01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,000
kind of hybrid multi-cloud

01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:39,760
infrastructure

01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,440
and as we heard from previous speakers

01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:45,119
um cloud native

01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:47,440
is really the de facto um

01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:48,880
kind of deployment model of choice today

01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:52,159
and it is

01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,800
it is becoming a framework for

01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:55,199
developing

01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,080
reliable and scalable software and

01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:58,880
modern software

01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,679
architecture stacks so in summary our

01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,520
view is that

01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:03,280
anything that can be automated should be

01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,760
automated from the edge to core and

01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:07,679
across every layer of the stack

01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,960
so let's put this in context a little

01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:11,280
bit

01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:12,880
this framework summarizes much of the

01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,880
thinking that we currently have on our

01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,360
architecture for an end-to-end full

01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,080
stack

01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:19,920
software-defined architecture and it

01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,920
starts with building real-time

01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,880
observability into the state of the

01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,280
infrastructure

01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,040
and then leveraging that data possibly

01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,800
augmented with additional insights from

01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:31,520
machine learning and ai

01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,840
which can then be pushed to the control

01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,159
and

01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:35,520
software programmability and capability

01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,280
of the infrastructure

01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,560
so that the desired state of the

01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,040
infrastructure

01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,159
can be pushed down through programmatic

01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,080
interfaces

01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:46,880
so now let me spend a few minutes to put

01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,880
this in context

01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:52,639
we really view that infrastructure as i

01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,040
mentioned

01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:57,280
has to be taken has to be viewed

01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:59,760
holistically across the

01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,800
stacks from data center all the way to

01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,000
networking to

01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:07,119
virtual networking to the server and

01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,159
hardware as well as compute and um

01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:12,400
in this view you can see that

01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:14,800
in order to achieve this vision you need

01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:16,960
to have apis that can provide

01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:19,119
abstraction to all those layers from the

01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:22,639
edge to cloud

01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:26,239
um let me bring my next

01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:28,960
slide here apologies

01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:30,480
so in summary there is really four range

01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,880
of capabilities that we need to

01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:35,040
to build here one is around the

01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,560
infrastructure itself which today is

01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,480
really going through a lot of

01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,880
um changes in terms of the technologies

01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:43,199
available the disaggregation models

01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,920
and the open source including open

01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,840
hardware

01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,119
capabilities that are becoming available

01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,440
then and the

01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:51,360
the discipline of building real-time

01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:53,520
observability across

01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:55,440
your entire infrastructure and for every

01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,400
single component of the infrastructure

01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,040
that in itself

01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:00,800
is a interesting is a very interesting

01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:03,360
engineering discipline and then

01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,920
building those software programmability

01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,719
hooks

01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,880
or interfaces and then finally

01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:11,119
orchestration which should happen

01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,199
really um leveraging software and cloud

01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:16,000
native technologies

01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:17,440
and we we defined kind of the end-to-end

01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,239
architecture and different

01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,880
domains as you can see here from access

01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,880
typically

01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,159
stop five millisecond latency to the

01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,800
user and then

01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:28,960
what we call a micro edge typically five

01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:31,520
to ten millisecond and then macro edge

01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,800
five to ten and then i'm sorry the ten

01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,119
to fifty and then

01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:37,840
fifty two hundred typically for cloud

01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:37,840
access

01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:42,560
so to put things in context really this

01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,400
is this diagram just shows that a

01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,960
typical technology stack

01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,760
includes um everything from the physical

01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,400
data center

01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,199
power space cooling to the networking

01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,400
that happens

01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:55,040
inside the data center from fiber cross

01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,560
connect

01:40:55,040 --> 01:41:00,480
to um to the data center network fabric

01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,560
and then between the data centers in the

01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,520
metro leveraging optical technologies

01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,920
but also land

01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:07,040
crowding switching and then all the way

01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,280
up to

01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:11,440
server and bare metal as a service and

01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:14,960
this is really the view that

01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:18,719
we are looking at and we are looking at

01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:21,199
ways as i mentioned to embed these

01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:24,800
observability and control mechanisms

01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:26,800
across all the layers of the stack

01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:28,880
and across the across the board there is

01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,639
a number of technological advances that

01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,159
are really pushing the infrastructure to

01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:35,119
become more distributed

01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:36,719
and are creating possibilities for

01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:38,800
physical infrastructure to be

01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:40,080
managed through software in ways and not

01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,400
previously seen with previous

01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:44,800
technologies

01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,239
so to put things in context just let me

01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,400
give you two examples

01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:50,080
if we apply this concept all the way

01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,600
down in the bottom of the stack to the

01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:54,800
physical data center

01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,679
you can imagine that even if a circuit

01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,199
breaker

01:41:55,679 --> 01:42:02,000
can today be a program through software

01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:04,239
and in this in this example the idea is

01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,400
to replace a traditional static circuit

01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:07,199
breaker with a software-enabled circuit

01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,880
breaker

01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:10,560
which we are designing here at equinix

01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,880
and testing in one of our labs

01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,719
and by monitoring the power consumption

01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:16,080
in real time and leveraging machine

01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,920
learning models to predict

01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:19,840
future consumption patterns we can

01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,719
actually start to dynamically

01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:24,320
manage power and cooling which are

01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,119
pretty limited resources in a data

01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:28,400
center

01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:31,600
versus statically managing these with

01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:34,880
traditional circuit breakers

01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:36,560
in another example this is how we

01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,480
manage bare metal and with our

01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,400
acquisition of packet this is a true

01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:42,639
example of software defined

01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:44,480
bare metal as a service where we can

01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:46,719
deliver hardware as a speed of

01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,520
at the speed of software in less than 30

01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,560
seconds

01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:52,800
and you can see that here

01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,840
the tinkerbell bare metal orchestration

01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,400
engine that

01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,520
is now open source contributed by packet

01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,480
is really enabling

01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,520
such orchestration um for delivering

01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:04,960
hardware at

01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,960
the at the speed of software

01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:11,280
so let me now shift gears and talk about

01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:12,719
5g in mobile edge which is a great

01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:16,159
example of distributed

01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:18,000
infrastructure so for us

01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:19,920
really 5g represents a major

01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,920
technological inflection point bringing

01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,639
significant improvements in capacity and

01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,960
performance

01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:26,960
compared to the previous generations and

01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:28,480
specifically the most recent one 4g and

01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,280
lte

01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:33,040
and 5g we will be to wireless what

01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:35,360
broadband was to wireline

01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,880
creating an always-on ubiquitous

01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,639
experience and delivering

01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,880
high throughput in the order of

01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:41,679
multi-gigabit per second data rates with

01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,719
very low

01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:48,000
access latency down to one millisecond

01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:51,119
as well as high device density

01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,560
and division of 5g really cannot

01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:57,840
be delivered

01:43:54,560 --> 01:44:01,119
unless the underlying infrastructure

01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:02,239
substrate is is optimally managed and

01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:04,639
built

01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:06,320
and this underlying infrastructure

01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:09,199
substrate includes

01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:11,360
spectrum radio access network micro edge

01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:13,119
data centers macro edge data centers as

01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,000
well as transport network hardware

01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:16,639
interconnection

01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,080
and an ecosystem of producers and

01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:20,320
consumers

01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:22,159
and this is really very much like a

01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:24,239
multi-variable function

01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:26,560
which is to say that ultimately the goal

01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:28,560
of making 5g reality becomes

01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:31,840
an exercise of optimizing this

01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,840
infrastructure substrate

01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:38,159
so let's use latency as an example to

01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:39,920
illustrate this

01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:41,199
one of the fascinating possibilities

01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,440
with 5g is

01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:44,800
delivering very low end to end latency

01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:47,760
and a common example

01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,679
is a sub 10 millisecond or some five

01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,400
millisecond target for device to

01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:53,679
application

01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:55,199
round-trip latency and if we look at the

01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:59,280
overall latency budget

01:44:55,199 --> 01:45:00,800
it is not hard to see that um

01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,239
really a new approach to

01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:04,159
infrastructuring interconnection

01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:05,280
architecture is needed to achieve this

01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:07,600
goal

01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:09,920
and this is because the latency budget

01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:12,639
say five milliseconds in this example

01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:13,360
includes all the radio mobile core

01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:15,440
transport

01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:17,040
and processing delays on the data path

01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:19,280
between the application running on the

01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:22,159
user's device and the application

01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,880
running on the computer slash server

01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,719
side

01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,719
and given that almost two milliseconds

01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,639
will be required for the air interface

01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,000
the remaining three milliseconds is all

01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:32,639
that's left for radio

01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,600
packet core processing network transport

01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:36,480
and the compute

01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,480
processing budget

01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:44,800
so which means that

01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,000
the proximity of network functions to

01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:49,040
edge compute can

01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,600
directly influence influence the latency

01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:54,719
profile of the 5g network

01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:56,840
and for example co-locating together the

01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:59,440
cran 5g core and edge computing

01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,920
functions can result in the ability to

01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,159
support

01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,719
low latency use cases but also

01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:07,119
co-locating these functions in a modern

01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:09,600
reliable data center at the edge can add

01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:12,480
ultra reliability features to low

01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:17,040
latency capabilities

01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:20,000
so a key another key capability of 5g

01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:21,199
is that can be software enabled is

01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,760
network slice

01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:24,800
we believe that applications that will

01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,760
be enabled by

01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,320
5g will need access to many resources

01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,280
including

01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:32,000
internet different clouds private or

01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,400
public

01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,600
and edge compute workloads placed in

01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:38,560
close physical

01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,560
proximity to the user plane functions

01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:43,199
and this includes hybrid traffic flows

01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,119
that require a combination of the above

01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,239
for distributed applications such as

01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:50,000
online gaming

01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:52,719
ai at the edge etc and we believe that

01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:56,000
real world 5g use cases will evolve

01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:59,360
to an increasingly hybrid architecture

01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:01,600
multi-cloud and multi-mech

01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,880
so network slicing allows to

01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,639
interconnect

01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,199
different components on the same

01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:08,000
physical network to deliver services

01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,320
with specific

01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,360
requirements such as latency throughput

01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:16,159
capacity reliability or security

01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,800
and this could be a network slice to

01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:19,280
access

01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,520
multiple instances of edge compute from

01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:25,360
the same or different providers

01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:28,719
or possibly interconnection to

01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,719
one or multiple clouds

01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,719
and we are working on use cases and

01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:36,719
architectures that

01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:38,560
really enable such use cases and

01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:40,400
we are in discussions with a number of

01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,920
players and we have a lab

01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,679
at equinix that i'm going to talk about

01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,840
later so if you're interested in

01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:48,159
collaborating please please join us

01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:49,119
we're also involved in the lf edge that

01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:52,560
i will cover

01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:52,560
uh in in a second

01:47:53,360 --> 01:48:00,239
so these use cases

01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:02,719
um as i mentioned for

01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:04,320
for a number of use cases that require a

01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:06,960
very low latency

01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,920
let's say below 10 milliseconds there is

01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,520
still some work

01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,360
that needs to be done to really

01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,800
understand and develop these use cases

01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,800
but we believe that

01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,400
the vast majority of applications and

01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,719
services can perform

01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,639
quite well and even very well at what we

01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:23,840
call the macro action level

01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:26,480
where latencies between a 5g device

01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:28,480
and an application workload can be kept

01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:31,280
between 10 to 50 milliseconds

01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:32,719
and example use cases include private 4g

01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:35,440
5g networks

01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,880
including regional networks for utility

01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:38,800
energy and retail

01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,920
but also augmented reality for

01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,800
industrial design

01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:44,880
or enterprise wireless van over fixed

01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:47,040
wireless access

01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,400
in many cases these applications require

01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:51,119
access to resources that

01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:52,000
are distributed across multiple clouds

01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:54,639
edge compute

01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,159
and general internet and we at econics

01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:58,560
believe that our existing

01:48:56,159 --> 01:49:00,719
richly interconnected macro data centers

01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:03,440
can offer a suitable platform for

01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:05,119
deploying 5g infrastructure including

01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:07,760
user plane functions

01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:09,760
and enabling traffic breakout and

01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:15,119
interconnection to the rich ecosystem of

01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:18,080
provider and consumer platforms

01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:19,440
so now let's talk about another use case

01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,320
of distributed infrastructure

01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:25,360
distributed ai

01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:27,440
so ai per se is not a new concept

01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:28,560
but with advances in machine learning

01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,520
and deep learning

01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,159
ai is now transforming virtually every

01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,920
industry

01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:35,360
just like electricity did some hundred

01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:37,599
years ago

01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:39,679
and the amount of compute used in the

01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:41,920
largest ai training runs today

01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:43,199
has been increasing has been increasing

01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,199
exponentially

01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:46,800
and it's been doubling almost every

01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:47,840
three and a half months versus the

01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,760
two-year doubling

01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,560
period of moore's law which held for

01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:56,320
almost 40 years

01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:59,679
and this is a typical simplified view

01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:02,080
of an ai workload and where

01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:02,719
data is being generated typically from

01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:05,119
multiple

01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:07,440
sources that can be in the cloud or on

01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:08,480
iot devices or anywhere in the network

01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,000
and then there is a level of

01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:13,520
pre-processing that's typically

01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,280
done and then there's a lot of compute

01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,679
and processing that needs to happen

01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,520
to build those training models and

01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:21,360
fine-tune them and test them

01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:23,199
until we get to the kind of prediction

01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,800
stage which is called inference in the

01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:27,840
ai terminology

01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:30,560
and typically training and

01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:32,880
inference has been have been happening

01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,440
on the cloud because they typically

01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,080
require

01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:37,199
a lot of compute resources and large

01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:39,440
data sets to

01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:40,480
for the algorithms to to to perform

01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,800
optimally

01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:44,320
but because of a number of um

01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:46,880
technological trends

01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:48,000
but also requirements from user side we

01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:51,360
see that

01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,520
ai is really moving from the edge

01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:56,320
to the from the cloud to the edge or at

01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:59,360
least a portion of ai infrastructure

01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:02,560
and um when you think also about

01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:04,800
um well moore's law for sure is

01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,639
allowing to do a lot more processing

01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:10,239
than before but also

01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:11,119
the advances and ai and algorithm

01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:13,599
efficiencies

01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:14,639
have now allowed us to do or can now

01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:16,960
enable us to do

01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:18,080
a lot more ai with the same amount of

01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,560
resources

01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:22,239
so when you put all of that together

01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:24,719
this is just to say that

01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:25,920
ai can now be really deployed in a

01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,760
number of

01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:30,159
tiers of infrastructure obviously the

01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:32,159
cloud but also increasingly at the macro

01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:33,199
edge where training can be effectively

01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:35,199
performed

01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:37,440
and but also inference can be done at

01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:39,360
the macro edge level but also micro edge

01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:42,960
smaller data centers

01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:46,639
that um that have smaller kind of

01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:47,440
power kind of capabilities but obviously

01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:50,000
on the device

01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,719
as well increasingly and there is a lot

01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,880
of inference

01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:55,360
going on and i personally believe that

01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:57,360
5g will also create new possibilities

01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:59,599
because the amount of data that can be

01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,159
pushed from these devices to the network

01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:03,599
and back

01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:09,040
will increase with 5g

01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:09,040
so let me go to the next slide here

01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:14,480
and um really some of the architectural

01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,800
considerations in terms of

01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,840
where is the best place to run training

01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:21,199
and and

01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:24,320
and inference depends on the questions

01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:27,440
of security privacy cost uh

01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:30,719
performance but also availability uh

01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:34,000
of your of or of your ai use case

01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:35,760
uh with that let me shift gears and um

01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,119
just before i do that i just wanted to

01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,679
also

01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:40,960
kind of mention that we are working on

01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:43,599
similar capabilities

01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:45,520
for building an orchestration layer to

01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:48,480
bring all these pieces together

01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:49,360
and really create an environment where

01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:52,719
developers

01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:53,760
can come to platform econics and deploy

01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:56,080
and manage their

01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,599
ai as a service infrastructure in a

01:52:56,080 --> 01:53:00,480
distributed way

01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:00,480
through software

01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:05,280
so and in in conclusion i want to talk

01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,040
about

01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:08,719
uh some of the work that we're doing in

01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,719
the industry and collaborating and our

01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:14,000
collaboration with players in the

01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:16,639
5g edge space first we are

01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,239
an active member of the linux foundation

01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:19,040
we have been a member for quite a few

01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:21,440
years

01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:24,239
within the lf edge which we joined last

01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:25,920
year as a premier member

01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:28,960
we have a seat in the governing board

01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:30,000
but also we are the technology technical

01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,159
lead for the

01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,840
public cloud edge interface blue

01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:35,599
blueprint as well as the

01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:38,320
a member of the technical steering

01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:40,960
committee for project ukrainian

01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:42,480
and we cannot be more pleased with the

01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:44,400
level of collaboration

01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,239
and thought leadership that this

01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:48,560
organization is really

01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:49,280
delivering and helping the community to

01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,320
understand

01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:54,320
better the use cases across the range of

01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:57,599
hardware and software

01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:59,520
platform providers lf networking we have

01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:02,159
been a silver member

01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:02,960
for some time and we are increasing our

01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,040
efforts

01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,040
to hopefully work with the community to

01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:09,679
help take onap to the next level

01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:11,760
we're very pleased to hear that google

01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:15,360
has joined at the top

01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:17,599
level membership today and with cncf

01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,719
we joined as a gold member last year

01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:21,920
second um

01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,840
top membership level and through our

01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:25,280
history with packet we have been an

01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,760
active member and have been

01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,480
making quite a few contributions there

01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,960
and

01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:36,719
finally on the 5g and edge

01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,920
space we have announced some time ago

01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:41,280
that we are launching

01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:43,440
a lab or a proof of concept or a sandbox

01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:45,760
place in our infomart location

01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:47,920
campus in dallas and the goal here is

01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:48,800
really to create an open environment to

01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:51,760
allow

01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,080
players across the entire stack to come

01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:54,960
and

01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:57,440
understand and try the different use

01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,080
cases of hybrid multi-cloud or anything

01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:00,159
that is of

01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:01,920
interest and leverage the ecosystem that

01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:04,239
is already placed at equinix

01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:05,280
but also beyond that uh we announced

01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:08,639
last week that

01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:10,639
we are enabling rakuten as the digital

01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:12,239
infrastructure provider for their global

01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:14,639
service rollout plans

01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:15,520
but also we announced a a collaboration

01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:19,040
with nokia

01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,760
for for the global iot and platform and

01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:22,880
edge

01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:24,639
enablement um so with that um

01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,960
i would like to invite all of you this

01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:29,679
is a great community to to come together

01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,840
and work together on these use cases to

01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:33,840
really help

01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:36,080
drive these and these trends

01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,960
and and the requirements to the next

01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,560
level

01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,239
so with that thank you very much for

01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:43,599
your time continue to stay

01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:43,599
healthy and well thank you

01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:49,199
thank you justin uh really really

01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,440
exciting times

01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:52,639
uh from from equinix and looking forward

01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:54,560
to your leadership

01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:55,840
so with that we conclude our keynote

01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:59,920
sessions uh we're a

01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,239
few minutes over uh uh audio issues but

01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:03,040
uh

01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:03,920
short break uh the sessions start

01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:06,719
exactly

01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,599
at 2 p.m eastern standard time so take a

01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:09,040
quick break

01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:10,639
don't miss out on some of the rich

01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,599
content thank you for joining the

01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:13,199
keynotes today

01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:29,840
looking forward to the keynotes tomorrow

01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:29,840
morning thank you
