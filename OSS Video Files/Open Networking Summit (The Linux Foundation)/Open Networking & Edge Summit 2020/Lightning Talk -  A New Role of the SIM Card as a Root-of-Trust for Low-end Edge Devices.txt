hello

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,480
i'm paula repalow the founder of hcloud

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,720
technologies a consulting agency focused

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,400
on iot and edge computing

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,320
over the last year we have tested a

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,039
couple of age gateways and come to the

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,960
conclusion

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,240
that it's really possible to bring high

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
security capabilities

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,560
even to low end edge hardware with the

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
help of sim cards

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,239
we're also taking an assumption that

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
during the next 10 years

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,040
significant percentage of small edge

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,440
gateways will have a 5g on board

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,840
so in some way they need to be equipped

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,120
with a certain type of sim

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,120
so what's actually the sim card

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,199
besides the well-known plastic in

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,559
various form factors

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,360
there is also ecm the same type of theme

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,559
but in embedded format which needs to be

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,520
soldered on board

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,400
during the device production there is

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,920
also a new way called icm

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,479
which is similar to sim os running in te

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,240
trusted execution environment in the

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,560
main courtship

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,240
despite the form factor today all of

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,360
these we are calling sim

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,159
subscriber identification module

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,880
which is used for authentication users

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
in 3g

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,280
4g and 5g networks let's take a look

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
even deeper

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,360
what's inside the modern sim card and

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
how it could help us to secure edge

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,840
applications

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,920
so inside we have an operating system

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,079
which is usually java card and the

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
number of supplementary functions and

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,479
security domains

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,159
one stands for root security domain and

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,320
call it isdr

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,640
and the number of isdps which is

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,840
security domains for profiles

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,000
which could be created updated or

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,799
deleted the key purpose of isdps

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,880
is to delegate a secure space to the

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,159
mobile operator or some other mobile

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,079
subscription owners

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,960
in order to be able to execute remote

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,319
sim provisioning over the year

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,480
there are two ways to manage profiles

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,800
so call it m2m model and consumer model

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,000
the key difference between them is how

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,959
we are initiating profile manipulations

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,959
in m2m model it's done from the backend

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,080
side

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,640
towards to the euacc while in consumer

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,879
model

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,959
it's initiated from the device side

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,080
whether it's smartphone or even iot

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,920
device

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
and storage to the backend

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,760
infrastructure

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,160
all these things are well described in

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,480
json aspects

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
few extra words about backend rsp

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,040
infrastructure

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,080
an mtm scenario shown on the left side

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,640
i'm not loading subscriptions in smdp

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,959
subscription manager data preparation

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,760
which is usually belongs to mno

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,599
and then by smsr which is secure router

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
usually belongs to ecm owner

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,720
downloading and profiles from a

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,720
different smdps

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
in case of consumer scenario on the

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,120
right side

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,800
profile loading initiated via lpa which

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,319
is local profile administration

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,760
triggered by a human or some

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,480
programmable logic on device side

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,840
with further usage of smds which is

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,440
discovery service

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,840
and smdp plus which is combined uh

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,560
profile data preparation and secure

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
routing

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,319
for downloading it into euacc

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,840
both schemas operated and secured by

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,000
global ci and ca

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
controlled by gsma with correspondent

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,239
certification process called

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:49,440
gsms there is also a new spec

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,080
has been issued in december 2019 by gsma

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,040
and call it

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,159
iot safe iot sim outlet for secure

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,720
end-to-end communication

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,280
this pack done specifically to secure

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,439
iot data and provide a root of trust for

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
a security less connectivity for device

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,720
apps

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,760
at the moment there are five reference

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,080
scenarios in the spec

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,799
but i'm pretty sure it could be extended

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,400
more later on the way

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,639
how it could be used here

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,519
i'm showing ultra simplified diagram

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,600
with the purpose

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,720
not falling to complex and detailed

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,560
message flows

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,120
but rather highlight the overall use

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,639
case this is theoretical but still quite

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
close to the reality of one of our

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,199
latest projects

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,880
example of age gateway which is handling

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,560
two main function

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,360
one is to provide the telemetry and

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,919
controls from the power

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,199
transformer to local dso in order to

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,639
maintain the functioning

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,759
and energy balancing services the second

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,320
function

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,639
is to send energy metering and day head

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,440
prognosis to another organization called

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,360
here energy supplier

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
in this scenario each gateway

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,240
infrastructure provider

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,240
ordering a sim cards from a factory with

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,800
initial mobile profiles

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,320
soldering them on the gateway near to

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,720
nbiut modem

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,560
then provision a specific route secure

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,280
domain with the keys

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,479
for application security then ships to

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,800
clients

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,639
in order to be mounted in the fields

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
once device appear on air

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
we can optionally load another mobile

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
subscription

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
tailor it for the specific region or

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,720
specific country

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,440
thanks to rsp remote sim provisioning

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,560
then for each application we could

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,080
create and dedicate secure domains

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,160
issuing and citing corresponding

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
certificates with the ci which is behind

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,800
the scene

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,639
once preparation is done we could have a

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,919
secured management communication

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,080
with a solution provider for instance

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,560
based on pre-sharing keys

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
sign the metering data for energy

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
company

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,880
with a specific certificate what they

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,360
will trust in their region

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,280
and secure communication channel with

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,680
the maintenance and control guys

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,960
who want to minimize the risk of hacking

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
power equipment under their

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,759
responsibility

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,680
let's see how it could look under the

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
hood if we would use

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,800
edgex foundry in order to expand this

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,759
approach for a wider range of cases

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
sim card playing a role of secret

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,440
storage

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,639
and talking to a security proxy

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,120
microservice

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,360
on management services we could place a

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,440
microservice for lpa servers

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,720
local profile administration to deal

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,240
with remote sim provisioning

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,639
infrastructure

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,560
which could be also extended with a

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,080
logic of profile switchover for

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,199
redundant connectivity purpose

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,440
so to summarize it could be a good

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,360
and cost efficient way to reuse the sim

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,759
card as a root of trust for highly

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,160
integrated gateways

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,400
also this could be a subject to extend

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,599
iot safe spec for multi-application

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,560
purpose

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,280
and also decouple secure uplift

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
functions

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,960
from a mobile operator profiles in order

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,000
to allow

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,160
service providers to manage

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,520
secure domains for application security

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
independent

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,360
i would be happy to discuss this

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,800
approach with the community here

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,280
before falling to coding and debugging

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,479
feel free to contact me here or linkedin

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,680
or email

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,840
and enjoy the rest of ins thank you

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,840
again

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,039
all right pablo thank you so much

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,800
we have you now live on the phone bridge

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,759
i don't see any q a questions

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,240
so we can wait for a few minutes for q a

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,080
or

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,800
feel free if you have any final words

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
that you wanted to give

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,520
yeah so while we are waiting for any

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,319
kind of questions

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,759
i could add a few words that

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:26,160
for now uh we

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:28,879
are actively

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
possible integration of this kind of

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,159
solution to

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,159
objects founder or we are also

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,360
considering project eve

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,159
in this in this direction and

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,919
probably we for the for the next

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,880
integration projects we will

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,040
introduce this this solution this kind

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,959
of solution uh

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,360
integrated part of lfh projects

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,240
and later on we'll be happy to share

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,279
more experience

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
regarding the kind of practical

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,240
integration

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,120
of adjectives foundry

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,480
to to to the to the real projects for

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,440
the moment it's

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,560
it operates under with without this kind

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,240
of component because

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,200
kind of we have just only two

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
data streams and the local

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,160
virtualization

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,600
is done just in the manner of

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,600
environmental linux

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,680
on the age gateway and just independent

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,640
processes

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,200
what's what we are all of them we are

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,200
controlling

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,279
so please express your questions or

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,880
any kind of ideas around this area

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080
so would be would be really hard to hear

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,200
any kind of

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,360
critics or or real ideas

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,360
how to how to draw it because not all of

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,720
the hd wave has

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,839
has tpns so the the intel platforms

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
have this embedded so there is no this

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,120
kind of issue is not not really related

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,200
to intel platforms

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,240
but rather to low end hd waves

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
based on arm which is quite popular and

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,920
for

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,279
massive adoption for massive purpose

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,959
we can push out your iot approach and

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:35,360
introducing the edge gateways means

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,360
beta virtualization linears near to iot

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,360
