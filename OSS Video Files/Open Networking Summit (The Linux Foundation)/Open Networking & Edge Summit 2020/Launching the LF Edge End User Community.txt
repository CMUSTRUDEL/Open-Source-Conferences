	00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,439
all right so welcome to launching the

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,480
elevator

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,839
end user community uh we are a glad you

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
could join us my name is

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,759
brett preston and i will be one of your

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,400
hosts today

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,200
uh joining me and my colleagues uh jill

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,199
and aaron

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,199
helping to moderate some of the q a

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
along with several of our speakers and

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,320
panelists

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,320
this is the first of two kickoff events

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,720
for this end user initiative the second

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,199
of which we will provide a little more

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,960
information during the presentations we

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,480
have several use cases lined up for you

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,239
today including automotive

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,520
manufacturing and telco and just a few

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
notes before we start

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,920
this session will be recorded with

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,280
materials posted to the elf edge wiki

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,440
following the call

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,719
for questions we will utilize the q a

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,120
feature in zoom

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,120
i think for most it'll be in the lower

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,039
toolbar of your zoom windows

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,559
it may be in the upper toolbar depending

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
on browser as well

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,680
but you'll see that q a feature and

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,680
depending on flow

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,879
we may take some live questions after

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,800
the last panel

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,479
uh should we activate and take live

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,760
questions you'll use the raise hand

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,119
functionality

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,960
um that zoom also uh provides and so

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,200
without further ado allow me to

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,240
introduce our pit joshua pura

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,439
a gm of edge iot and networking at the

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,640
linux foundation

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,439
and jason shepard lfedge board member

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,000
and

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,960
vp of ecosystem at zededa to get us

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
started

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
our pip very good all right so we have a

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,479
very

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,479
uh packed agenda today and

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,920
i think we want to make sure that uh

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,240
you get a lot of questions answered here

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,439
uh

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,720
i'm really excited to show uh and walk

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
you through the bigger

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,960
lf edge and edge market in general and

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,040
what we have accomplished and

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
jason and i will be sort of spending a

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,560
little bit of the time

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,920
of time up front setting this up uh

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,719
because there's definitely

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,119
a challenge of defining what an end user

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,159
is

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,119
uh who a vertical is and more

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,200
importantly what is

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,000
an edge and i think we've accomplished

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,760
quite a bit on that as a community so

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,440
thank you for participating in 2018

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,879
um when edge was kind of

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,480
kind of new this chart was very popular

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,480
and it essentially said that because of

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,599
five technology building blocks

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,480
right whether it's 5g microservices that

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,519
allowed for

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,280
app portability uh ai for allowing for

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,640
predictive maintenance type things

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
as well as you know all the hardware

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,680
acceleration that came at a fairly

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
decent cost

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,120
and then the fifth final thing which was

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,879
kind of the on-demand

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,000
network that got added a whole series of

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,840
new applications would emerge and i'm

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,879
using the word

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,280
would in 2018 that would demand

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,920
lower latency and accelerated processing

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
and they

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
those applications could be on the

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,000
telecom side um

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,360
uh for wireless or wireline or or

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
enterprise if they could be on

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
autonomous device sides immersive

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,120
experiences

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,159
iot analytics it just that was just a

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
vision right

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,239
now the good news is in the last two

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,280
years the industry has

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,840
moved forward matured and

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,599
with the help of you all in the

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
community as well as a lot of analysts

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,480
we have

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:30,159
narrowed down several of these use cases

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,959
and established an important factor

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,519
that allows for these use cases to

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
prosper

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,000
right but before i get into that an

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,599
important factor that

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,159
came around was the pandemic

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,200
and all of a sudden in this new normal

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,159
edge became

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,120
even more critical right in a lot of

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,360
industries

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,239
and then 5g became a lot more critical

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280
so

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,439
what we have been saying is that edge is

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,439
four times the size of the cloud market

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,360
according to several analysts and now

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,200
analysts are starting to quantify this

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,439
market significantly

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,239
so let's go to the next slide and i'll

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,720
show you

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,879
how applications and use cases are kind

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,560
of narrowing down

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,160
kpmg came out and said software is

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,199
there's a lot of software required in

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,519
several of these industries

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,919
healthcare industrial transportation

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,360
environmental gaming etc

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,720
and on the right our community focus

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,440
in a priority list was industrial energy

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,199
oil gas

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,680
commerce retails etc so we were kind of

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
narrowing in on on as a community which

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,320
vertical

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,880
markets and groups will benefit the most

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,960
from

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,440
the edge compute revolution right and

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,680
what's the best way to serve them

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,000
uh so this was one view that just came

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
out another view that came out if you go

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,320
to the next slide

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,040
is uh from uh

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,320
from from our friends at iot analytics

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,440
right and this is again

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,440
uh an iot specific view and

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,360
you may have heard me say this multiple

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,400
times right uh

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,280
not iot not all iot requires edge

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
and not all edges for iot so we got to

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,639
understand that

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
edge is a horizontal concept and jason

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,160
will come

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,440
right with me in a couple of minutes and

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,520
explain

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,880
the terminology and the definition and

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,960
all the work that the

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,240
community has done uh to to allow for

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,840
a crisper definition uh but in this

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,240
uh iot centric view you can see that

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
you know the the markets are fairly

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
similar

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,639
uh the three big changes are the three

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
red arrows

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,479
uh that actually are going down in terms

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,880
of the market trend

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,160
and primarily this is direct impact of

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,520
the pandemic right

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,560
smart cities buildings others etc

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,319
but everything else is kind of going up

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
and i think this is a fairly accurate

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,120
picture of uh

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,680
of of the killer apps right again

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,520
manufacturing industrial transportation

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,160
mobility energy retail

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,199
some of the top markets if you go to the

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,960
next one

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,840
uh there was another view that came um

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,280
from our friends at 451 research and i

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,560
showed this at the one yes keynote

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,520
this actually has has taken

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,120
all the use cases now in several of

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,479
these verticals

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,400
and established both a horizontal and a

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,280
vertical solution right so

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,520
solutions for the specific target market

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,960
as well as generic solutions

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,000
that can go across markets and they have

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
sorted this down

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,720
by kind of bandwidth and latency which

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,680
are two very important factors for

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,280
the edge market to proliferate and i'm

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,880
you know pleased to report that

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,360
we are very much in line with this view

00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,919
as a lot of the blueprints and a lot of

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,400
the

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,000
horizontal solutions with the focus on

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,639
uh vertical blueprints

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,120
are being addressed in one of one of the

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,800
top two projects uh called a crano and

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
i think i should mention that edgex

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,240
foundry is the other

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,960
uh stage three project that it includes

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
a lot of iot framework use cases as well

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,919
so

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,919
that's kind of a high high level view of

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,560
how the market's proliferating

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,160
and if you go to the next slide i think

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,000
we're now

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,759
getting to the defining of the edge and

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,880
i'm going to hand it over to jason

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,919
to sort of explain what we have

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:45,599
accomplished and

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:48,000
how we should be using this jason

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,120
jason are you there

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,520
[Music]

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,520
oh

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
jason i see you no audio

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,599
brad

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,840
yep i am uh i'm sending him a quick

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
message

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
that his audio appears to be out

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,639
well i thought zoom should have ironed

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,280
out all these things

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,280
sorry folks

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,760
yeah it looks like he's not muted so

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,800
there's got to be something else going

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,839
on

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,839
could be his headphones or laptop

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,240
can you guys hear me now we can't say

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,600
okay jason

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
yeah i don't know why it's why it's not

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
working yeah i've been unmuted but oh no

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,440
i wasn't working through my

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,680
earbuds so um yeah so thanks carpet so

00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
uh

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
okay yeah so earlier this this year we

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,040
as a community

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,720
got deep into taxonomy so one of the old

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
jokes in the standards world is you know

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,760
how do you solve the standards problem

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,760
you come up with a new standard

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,760
and um you know we we also saw a lot of

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,360
problems out there with edge definition

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,560
in terms of there just being so many

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,640
different taxonomies

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,640
and and you know what i would call

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,279
loaded terms in terms of

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,240
you know ambiguous uh near and far thin

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,640
and thick and

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,080
and um you know so a lot of confusion

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
across the board

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,320
so what what we did is we came up with a

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
new taxonomy as a community

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
and this builds off of the one that we

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,000
had had when we launched

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,120
lfedge a little over a year and a half

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,720
ago

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,560
and the idea here was to break down

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
the edge which is really a continuum and

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,519
that's one of the first key concepts is

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,560
there's not a single edge

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,920
it's a spectrum of different locations

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,760
for compute and they're based on a

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,600
variety of trade-offs

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,279
and so the taxonomy we recommend you go

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,720
check out the taxonomy white paper it's

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,600
available online there's a link down

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
below if you get these slides but

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,440
you really get into a lot more detail

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
but

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
looking at the edge as a continuum and

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
thinking about it in terms of hard

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,079
technical

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
trade-offs makes it a lot more clear

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,600
what we're talking about

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,279
in terms of of how various different

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,959
edge compute

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,240
tools apply to various different use

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,680
cases so of course we've got centralized

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,920
data centers in the cloud that's on the

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,680
far right and on the far left you've got

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,839
uh highly constrained devices out in the

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,839
physical world

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,680
and the closer you get to the physical

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,200
world the more you move to the left on

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,600
this chart the more

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,519
uh custom complex everything gets you've

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
got very custom form factors you have

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,440
i mean every device out in the world has

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,560
got a different form factor you know

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,320
cars a little bit different than a

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
toaster and a lamp

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
um on the right you know very very uh

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
standardized um

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,680
you know high high scalability you know

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,600
in the end there's there's tens of

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,600
public clouds in the world

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,880
that are going to really matter uh on

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
the left there eventually will be

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,680
trillions

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
of uh devices out there in the physical

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,480
world so

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,040
huge exponential growth as you go to the

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,800
left uh in a perfect world we would

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,120
centralize all services

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,560
um you know in the back end but of

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,399
course the whole point with edges for

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,600
reasons of latency and bandwidth and

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,399
security autonomy

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,360
privacy etc we're seeing this shift

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
where where

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,920
of course there's still going to be

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,040
compute in the cloud but we'll see more

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,920
and more compute you know

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,440
at these various different edges two big

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,839
buckets that we've defined

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
is service provider edge uh and user

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,240
edge

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,160
the difference between these buckets is

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
that they're separated by the last mile

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,560
network whether it's

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,519
cell or wire line or otherwise

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,720
you know wide area network access on the

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,519
to the right side to the service

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,000
provider edge

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,200
local network on the user edge and

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,279
that's a really

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,360
important delineator because as much as

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,720
we talk about latency

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,639
and latency is a big factor and of

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,519
course 5g is driving latency down even

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,560
further

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,240
um if you're latency critical in terms

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,839
of your application like bad things

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
happen if the message doesn't get there

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,360
at all times and

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,120
especially in a deterministic fashion

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,000
you will always do

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
uh that compute or the any kind of

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,200
control

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,880
locally you know on the on the user edge

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,279
if it's latency sensitive

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,800
where where maybe it's video streaming

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,800
augmented reality all kinds of new

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,880
services that we're going to see around

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,560
you know augmenting assisted driving

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,880
autonomous et cetera

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
that we tend to want to centralize you

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
know at the service provider edge

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
because

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,440
we can scale across many users uh

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,279
service provider edge tends to be shared

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,680
resources you know owned by

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,279
obviously service providers user edges

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,720
tend to be more

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,600
owned by them the the end user whether

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,959
it could be

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,480
an enterprise or or a consumer and

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,760
there's a there's not a hard line and

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,440
there's some divide and we get into a

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,880
lot more detail in the paper but

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,800
that's the main bucket the next big

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,399
trade-off that you see so the on-prem

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
data center edge that's all

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,519
uh that's on-prem traditional data

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,200
centers we have in buildings we you know

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,320
micro modular data centers next year

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
building

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,160
the key uh here is that from the on-prem

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,000
data center edge

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,440
all the way to the right that's

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
generally

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,440
pretty consistent data center class

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,519
infrastructure there's some unique needs

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,079
around regulatory informals and whatnot

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,680
if you've got

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,360
stuff distributed in different locations

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,440
but

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,519
generally fairly consistent server class

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,920
networking infrastructure

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,399
and we're seeing evolutions of tools

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,560
like kubernetes moving left and and

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,079
helping to under comprehend distributed

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,279
clusters and things like that but

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,920
but again generally the same tools when

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,600
you

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,440
get to the left of the on-prem data

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,959
center now you're in what we call the

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,160
smart device edge and the reason we

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,160
called that is you know

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,519
as operate said there's you know iot is

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
a workload

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,040
within the broader edge spectrum you

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,120
can't forget about all those mobile

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,000
devices out there client compute etc so

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,360
the smart device

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,160
edge as we defined it is any

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,680
any compute uh outside of a physically

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,920
secure data center

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,040
that's still capable of running apps so

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
that includes

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,079
you know all the client devices that

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,480
we've had for some time

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,160
those are solved problems in terms of

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
ios and android and

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
windows you know big ecosystems around

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,360
those those uh

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,959
foundations but in the iot sense it's

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,199
the wild west so we've got

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,639
so many so much fragmentation around you

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,920
know whether it's a gateway or a hub a

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,360
route or a server or anything kind of

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,720
distribute out in the field

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,399
and you'll see as we talk about the

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
projects there's a lot of lf edge

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,360
projects looking at how can we

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
a lot of efforts how can we make more

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,399
consistency

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
and interoperability at that component

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,360
of the uh

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,800
of the edge continuum and then you go

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,800
one more click to the left and now

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,360
you're in constraint devices it's it's

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,959
generally driven by memory at about 256

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,720
megs of memory and below

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,320
you're now constrained enough to where

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,800
everything has to be embedded you can no

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,480
longer

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,160
do the abstractions for running

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,800
containers or virtual machines

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,000
it's it's much more custom embedded

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,480
software development which

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,399
adds a new layer of complexity and we're

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,360
seeing evolutions of tools there and

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,079
and things will get easier over time but

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
uh

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,000
each each one of these buckets has a

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,040
inherent trade-off and so we've gotten a

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
lot of traction on

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,120
on this white paper a lot of interest

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,760
because it it just breaks it down into

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,320
those

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,199
technical trade-offs wide area network

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,199
local network

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,680
in a data center not in the data center

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,399
able to run apps not able to run apps

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,680
so again recommend checking it out and

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
next slide we'll kind of talk about how

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,079
the

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,079
the projects fit across the spectrum

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,759
so so this is that same taxonomy that uh

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,959
we just talked about and and the

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,959
projects that we have today within um

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,519
ellophage actually a secure device

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,160
onboarding is not on this slide but um

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,720
that's that's all about uh how do we

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,639
drive

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,120
uh zero touch provisioning across the

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,839
devices in a scalable fashion you know

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,000
in the channel um you know arpa

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,920
mentioned to crano and ajax foundry

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,519
so crano is is spain it's more at the

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,560
infrastructure layer and and

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,120
while crano started with the the more of

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,920
a focus on us the service provider edge

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
blueprints are being built you kind of

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,320
across the spectrum when we

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,160
uh expect there to be even more tying

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,519
things together as you get closer uh you

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,720
know to the user's side and

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,399
in the physical world and

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,079
edgex foundry is is focused on how do i

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,079
make sense of all of the different

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
protocols and fragmented hardware and

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,560
whatnot within

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,759
uh that iot component of the smart

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,839
device edge

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,880
uh edgex is built for maximum

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,240
flexibility

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,839
and and um being

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,519
being very very modular it's it's a

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
cloud native approach with micro

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,759
services and and

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,600
platform independent uh architecture

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,120
a project that you know on the surface

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,000
it looks like they're they're highly

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,600
overlapped in

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,079
purpose but actually fledge has made

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,959
some different choices in terms of

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,640
what types of uh devices they go after

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,600
what types of use cases

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,000
they're both data stacks for for for iot

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,240
uh

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,559
workloads um how do i normalize

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,120
protocols how do i run analytics on top

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,640
but they're slightly different um

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,480
approaches and and of course the whole

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,480
point with lf edge is how do we start to

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,240
drive more convergence in projects over

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,559
time more appropriate but also

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,960
recognize that this is a continuum and

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,520
you can't have a one-size-fits-all

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,160
uh you know across the board home edge

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
is is

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,600
is actually leveraging some of the

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,679
different projects like like like an

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,760
edgex that's focused on

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,720
um how do we build you know services

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
around the home

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,400
you know more and more homes are going

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,160
to have these these server-based uh

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,919
uh nodes within the home that drive

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,960
different things like video surveillance

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,080
and

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,880
general ai workloads um so there's

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,640
focus there betel is a project uh

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,720
started by baidu that's

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,320
looking at how can you develop uh

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
services that we are delivered from the

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,120
cloud

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,200
closer to the the user for ai and the

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,080
like

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,840
open horizon is a project that's new to

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,160
lfeds it's around how do i distribute

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,160
containers across the spectrum

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,640
and then eve is is a project that

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,200
is really about how do i abstract that

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,559
complexity for iot edge compute

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,520
from the hardware so think of eve uh you

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,760
know it's kind of a

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,400
looking to be universal os so that you

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,799
can deploy any workload on top of

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,679
edge hardware i think of eve is like

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,280
doing

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,799
at the smart device edge what android

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,799
did for mobile

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,320
so uh all of these projects there's a

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,360
lot more detail online we'll get into

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,640
all of it and you'll hear a little bit

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,200
about the projects throughout

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,080
the day but each one of these projects

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,080
are are

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,919
targeting a specific spot of the

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,679
continuum and the whole point as

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,440
as arpa will summarize is how do we

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
harmonize this more over time

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,640
but most importantly is how do we make

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,919
them work really well for end users

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,559
which is the whole point of launching

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
this

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
this aspect of the community so that we

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,200
can you know

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,760
make sure that the the investment that

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,960
we're making here maximizes use for

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,080
uh end users uh if you go to the next

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,559
slide

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
and so

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,640
so you know i recommend you check out

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,960
the akraino uh

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,559
uh blueprints so there's a there's a

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,039
variety of blueprints today

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,919
we're on the release three within the uh

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,640
community we'll

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,000
talk about a little this this uh today

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,200
as we go through

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,280
um but again the idea is to create uh

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,600
deployment ready tested blueprints that

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,360
that address various different um

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,039
elements across the spectrum you can see

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,480
that it was more focused on the service

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,440
provider up front but we're starting to

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
see

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,120
additional extensions to that user edge

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
next slide

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,520
yeah the the point here so lf edge is

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,720
not about reinventing

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,640
things we're we're actually trying to be

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,159
as agnostic as possible around various

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,400
different technology choices there's a

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,480
lot of great technologies out there

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,159
what what we need as a community you

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
know for for edge for iot

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,520
for for really a lot of different trends

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,520
5g etc is

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,760
to package up these technologies you

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,039
know collaborate across the board both

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,919
upstream and downstream

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,039
and create more um consistent you know

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,000
interoperable

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,320
foundations that people can leverage and

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,320
then go focus on value um

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,600
you know the a big point of of open

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,120
source is to

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,480
um you know that shared technology

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,480
investment is to minimize

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,360
undifferentiated heavy lifting that so

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,960
many people

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,200
uh have done in the past and we're still

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,880
seeing it you know today is how do we

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,480
work together to create a more common

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
foundation and

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,240
and the whole point here with with with

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,159
getting feedback from end users is so

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,840
that we can maximize that horizontal

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
applicability while also recognizing

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
there's inherent trade-offs

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,799
uh we're also collaborating with some of

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,320
the various different consortiums out

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,799
there and

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,000
it really is about working together

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,640
across the board to

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
to make it easier to scale solutions for

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
customers

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
next slide

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,400
[Music]

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,320
um so so you'll see uh

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,840
if you go through the lfe site get

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,640
involved in any of the projects

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,000
you know a number of the the use cases

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,080
that we're already addressing

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,720
um you know are available in various

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,880
different demos online so each project

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,559
has got sort of some initial focus areas

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,480
we're looking at expanding that out as

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,080
we go

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,679
and you'll start to see more and more

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,880
bleed between the projects i mean

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,720
we're not trying to build vertical

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
vertically focused projects across the

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,919
board we want to build horizontal

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,280
technologies that are highly

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,120
applicable to a number of different

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,960
verticals and so

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,159
while we've started in certain areas

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
with these projects though

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,280
again the whole point here is to get

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,120
that feedback so we can make them

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,720
as flexible as possible across the board

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,559
and then start to see more harmonization

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,000
over time

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,799
next time i think with that

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
i'm going to hand it off back to arpet

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,520
to talk a little bit about the the

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
growth in lfe over the

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,600
course of the since we've launched it oh

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,080
thank you thank you jason so

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,039
you know we're really excited about how

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,280
lf edge

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,200
not only collaborates between the

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,720
projects but also

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,760
uh across uh the

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,559
networking community and the uh

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,120
cloud community and various consortiums

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,640
whether whether it's iic acc

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,520
uh et cetera okay so with that said uh

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,159
we actually announced a results of a

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,280
survey

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,400
that uh the members uh had this

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,520
this uh all the lfh members

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,559
uh you developers and many more and

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,720
we have really

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,240
been very pleased with the results

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,120
specifically because

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,080
the fundamental question that inherently

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,080
bothers

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,960
pretty much the business decision makers

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,000
is why should i do open source

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,640
and the first answer five years ago was

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,679
always

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,679
oh it's free and it's cheap and that's

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,480
no longer the case that's on the extreme

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,159
right yes

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,159
it does drive costs down but that cost

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,200
is really an operational cost as jason

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,320
said right

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,720
uh it's really that that

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,799
undifferentiated

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,480
software right and the interoperability

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,960
that we are accelerating in the open

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
source

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,720
but the three big things that have come

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,039
out from the survey is

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,280
you know people want to you know really

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,039
focus on market creation adoption and

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,679
acceleration and collaboration those are

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,960
the top three that's what

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:50,159
community driven collaboration through

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,559
foundations like lfh give you and that's

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,000
why

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,000
you know we are here to serve you right

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,120
so that's kind of the high level uh view

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,679
of this

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:02,720
community if you go to the next slide um

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,320
here's a snapshot of where where where

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,960
we have come in the last couple of years

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,360
this was launched in 18

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,080
definitely a very steady member growth

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,919
uh in terms of year over year

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,559
projects have definitely been on the

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,240
on the waiting list to get onto lfh as

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,520
they realize that this is where the

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,320
community is

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,120
um starting with state of the edge that

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,919
came in

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,080
as as kind of the as a as a project that

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,159
is again non-code but really

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,520
brings you the glossary brings you the

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,480
definition brings you

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,840
you know uh thought leadership etc uh

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,240
open horizon

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,880
uh sdo came in as jason pointed out

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,000
right so

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,039
good steady project pipeline um

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,200
deployments and downloads have

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
which are kind of the true measure of

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,760
adaptability

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,960
or adoption is really uh growing

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,440
significantly

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
and then i think what we need to look at

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,320
is

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,200
if you look at the two metrics that we

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,240
uh

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,360
we value one is the developer growth

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,840
and commits right so are there

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,400
people around the globe helping build a

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,360
community and are they contributing

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,080
and where where are they contributing so

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,279
really

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,559
all going up to the right

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,320
as we would like it um and thank you all

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,000
for doing it some of you are on the call

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,400
some of you have actually

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
presented done demos etc so that's kind

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,159
of the high level view of the community

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,720
very ex exciting for those of you on the

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,919
call who have not joined lf edge as a

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,159
as a company please do so contact us

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,000
it's very easy and it's a very vibrant

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,880
community so with that said

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,520
i think if you go to the community

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,600
landscape

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,440
page you if your company is not

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,400
represented here it's very easy this is

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,320
landscape.lfh.org

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,320
you can put it in it's it's a very

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,320
standard way of showing uh

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,760
progress and where you fit into the

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,799
overall landscape

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,279
uh if you go to the next one uh

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,520
that would basically summarize the

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,200
premium members and the projects i think

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,760
uh we talked about the

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
the nine projects here as as you you can

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,840
see there are

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
various stages of uh of growth uh and

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
maturity

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,840
in terms of the timeline and

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,880
deliverables and things like that

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,200
a wide cross-section of premium members

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,880
again we uh if you go to the next slide

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
i think it will summarize the premium

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
members quite well

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,440
this is the general members and the

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,679
liaison one but

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,039
the reason this is going yeah this is

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,320
fine go to the next one

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,520
um the reason we are getting so much

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,159
traction is

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,919
our goal at lf edge is to you know

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,400
harmonize and unify

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,559
edge in a horizontal manner and that's

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,000
across various markets iot enterprise

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,960
cloud and telecom

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,679
among others but more importantly we are

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,679
keeping it

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
open and interoperable right as a

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,640
community

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,159
we need to be hardware independent so

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,960
you can see the likes of

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,840
the arm intel qualcomm etc all part of

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,720
this commun

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,000
premium membership uh silicon right uh

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,760
independent uh of

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,600
all that independent of the cloud you

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,240
can see you know tencent and baidu

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,520
and and and a lot of the other players

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,159
joining here

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,559
independent of the os right there is no

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,640
one

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:25,760
os it could be very strong rtos

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,399
uh all the way to a lightweight linux

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,360
to any os that can fit in the

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,840
application

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,440
and clearly keeping the protocol

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,120
independence right there is

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,000
you know there's 150 messaging protocols

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,919
we are not

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,120
that interested in picking the winner

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,880
right uh

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,880
but the abstraction the life cycle

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,559
management that's what the team and

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,080
community is focused on

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,320
um and of course we're going to take

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,279
advantage of what's happening around

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,520
us right in terms of telecom cloud and

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,279
enterprise site for example 5g

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,559
which gives you that latency and

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,840
mobility uh

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,200
to your edge application absolutely

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,880
critical and then as jason said

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,720
right it's in collaboration with the

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,039
consortiums and

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,080
it's similar to other communities like

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,039
networking or

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,360
or cncf so uh that's kind of a quick

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,840
summary of lfh for those of you who have

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,840
not

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,360
really participated we're hoping

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,240
to have you on board and have as many of

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,799
your

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,679
players as well all right so with that

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,080
said

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,480
i think we can probably wrap here before

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,919
we start i think there are a few

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,039
a few questions let me see if

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,720
i can go back to the questions

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,640
could you share the presentations yes

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,000
this session is being recorded and it

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,440
will be posted i think that was

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,480
already answered um

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,159
how the next question was uh how about

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,640
etsy mech reference architecture

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,159
alignment in collaboration with etsy

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,200
uh so if you look at a crano and several

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,240
of the mac

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,480
blueprints are there already right which

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,200
is

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,399
very good news uh if you take a higher

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,039
level up you should

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,200
know that linux foundation at the linux

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,679
foundation level not at lfh but

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,520
at the linux foundation level has

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,039
publicly collaborated and

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:22,640
signed under press release last year uh

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,000
and and that's uh that's given us the

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,159
green light to

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,799
collaborate with these organizations

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,480
specifically at cnc mac

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,120
um all right i think that's it right did

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,919
i miss any

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,919
questions jill

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,520
no i think that's it

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,880
all right i think that's it jason do you

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,279
want to talk about the

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,039
yeah the vertical solutions group now

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,080
yeah i'll talk about um this real quick

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,399
and then we'll hand it off we'll start

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,120
with automotive but um

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,320
yeah definitely you know it's it first

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,559
and foremost we we just

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,640
encourage people to get involved um you

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,520
know anywhere within lf edge that makes

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,360
sense

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,880
um the the the idea with these

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,720
end user groups that we're launching

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,520
we've got this vertical um solution

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,600
focus group

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,640
um that we're bootstrapping it's a very

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,960
similar precedent

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,720
uh to what is running today in cloud

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,080
native compute foundation also lf

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,360
networking

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,760
this is about getting more uh feedback

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,399
from

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,159
end users that are consuming the code uh

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,320
from these projects

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,919
and and the goals as i kind of touched

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,159
on before is is

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,480
how do we make sure that these projects

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,120
as they they continue to evolve

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,960
provide maximum value for people

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,799
developing solutions regardless of

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,840
market whether it's

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,600
industrial enterprise or consumer

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,360
recognize that there's inherent

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,559
technical trade-offs

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,120
you know it is a continuum um but but

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,200
also

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,279
try to have as much commonality as

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,080
possible across the board

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,880
and so the these vertical uh solutions

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,919
groups

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,240
um will output requirements back into

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,880
the

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,559
the projects uh we'll create demos that

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,000
are specific to use cases and you and

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,399
you'll see some of that um

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,120
discussion happening today uh white

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,640
papers and

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,720
other collateral we'll build on the the

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,399
existing taxonomy white paper as we go

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,679
and get even deeper into various

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,840
different use cases but

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,799
the important point on the the first

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,120
round was

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,039
let's establish a common language in

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,360
terms of a taxonomy to make it

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,440
uh easier to have those discussions

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,440
around very focused

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,399
solutions on top uh next slide

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,799
so we've been bootstrapping this this

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,480
effort for for vertical solutions groups

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,480
we've got three that are that are in

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,679
flight today you know focused on

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,000
manufacturing

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,360
retail and and kind of telco cloud

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,880
various different services for very

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,200
specific use cases

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,480
uh delivered up by telcos uh that kind

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,279
of brings up a point you know

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,799
an end user can you know takes various

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,799
forms of course there's end users that

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,760
are companies delivering services to

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,200
to so they're their customers um it

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,320
could be any number of different uh

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,760
private companies

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,679
and then you've got service providers

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,480
that are basically consuming code and

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,799
delivering those

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,399
services uh to to end users since you've

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,440
got various different stacks

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,799
in the in the in the spectrum and you

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,799
know all is fair game

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,480
it's it's really looking at it as

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,200
consumers of open source

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,000
uh code to be able to go develop new

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,960
solutions

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,080
for for for a customer base or for for

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,039
end users

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,320
um you know very key point too is that

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,240
across the board

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,840
lfedge is is an open community

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,159
everything is done transparently

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,200
meetings are open uh recording shared

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,399
minutes

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,480
we welcome people to to contribute

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,840
uh join not only these end users groups

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,240
but also

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,760
various different elements of projects

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,080
as well

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,360
there are benefits to being a member in

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,000
addition you don't have to be a member

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,720
to contribute

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
to to lfedge um but there's benefits in

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,559
terms of i mean you saw

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,440
in the the survey results for marpit in

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,120
terms of

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,880
um you know breaking through and

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,640
developing new markets it's almost like

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,159
a vendor-neutral partner program

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,760
in terms of working with other uh

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,519
industry leaders and and

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,880
building even business relationships on

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,279
top of the work that we're doing in the

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,679
open

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,039
sense so um recommend you know the

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,080
consideration for membership but of

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,320
course you know

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,360
it's a technical meritocracy in in terms

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,679
of the uh

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,679
the code side of things next slide

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,640
uh so other ways to get involved so

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,600
brett mentioned that on on the 20th

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,320
we're doing a a second event like this

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,399
this one's

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,320
a little bit more centered around crano

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,360
given the tie to a lot of the networking

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,799
elements and and

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,240
the one es focus uh the next one will be

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,000
more holistic across the various

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,200
different projects uh there's some

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,320
reserve

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,880
registration information will be

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,440
available soon if you would like to lead

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,279
a new

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,640
uh group if if there's a another

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,679
vertical there's just you know many

00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,760
different spaces

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,720
um if you're an end user in any number

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,559
of verticals

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,240
where you see value in providing that

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,600
guidance to the project uh

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,839
email info at lf edge org um

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,119
and and all it you know takes in

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,040
addition to be willing to leave the

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,800
project is include one of the lfh

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,399
projects as a seed we always prefer to

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,679
have multiple projects because we're

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,679
trying to harmonize

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,359
uh across them but you know we do want

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,919
to have it relevant to at least one of

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,480
the

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,159
the core projects within the umbrella

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,359
and the other way to do it is just join

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,240
that the the attack

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,879
uh as mentioned all meetings are open um

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,720
and as

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,320
as progress updates around this this

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,960
thread that you'll you'll

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,839
just continue to keep informed uh last

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,159
slide

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,240
as i mentioned you know regardless of of

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,560
where your interests lie it's it's very

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,000
easy to get involved in lfedge

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:53,040
um there's a couple details here you can

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,960
just go to lfedge.org and just dig in uh

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,960
dive into any one of the projects

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
the tac does provide more of that kind

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,680
of comprehensive view across

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,280
um across the spectrum uh attend

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,160
meetings the best way to vote in open

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,320
sources with your

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,119
your keyboard of course in writing code

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,119
um so just feel free to dive in anywhere

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,040
but we would definitely welcome any

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,440
feedback from end users on how we can

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,240
maximize the potential for this to for

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
all of us to just

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,400
be able to focus on value creation

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,480
throughout the the the

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,839
spectrum so with that i think we're

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,960
going to get kicked off with

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,040
automotive as sort of the first uh

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,200
focus area you know both vertical and

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,920
some of the use cases within it so i'll

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,320
hand it off there

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,000
thank you jason thank you arpet and

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,079
thanks for uh folks

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,599
who have put questions into the q a

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,720
window for those that did

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,800
recently join we're leveraging the q a

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,960
functionality so as you have questions

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,720
that do come up feel free to ask and our

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,280
panelists will be happy to answer

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,079
now up next we have jumming zhang from

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,000
jinghang

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,520
with a automotive use case out of the

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,680
acreno project

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,720
i think it is a national holiday

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,320
actually in

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,720
china today so um but jimmy was gracious

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,240
enough

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,800
to prepare a a small presentation for us

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,680
aaron if you can go ahead dear members

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,000
i'm john tumi from singh home technology

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,000
i'm honored to have this opportunity to

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,280
introduce some technologies and

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,560
scenarios about autonomous journey

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,160
uh surprising the presentation so

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,839
it's the trend key technologies and

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,560
the application scenarios of ivy ics

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,359
um now i will introduce the first part

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,680
the first part

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,640
is the current overview of connected

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,599
across

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,119
once the automotive industry is deeply

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,599
integrated with the

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,320
internet of things communications and

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,359
other

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,440
fields people will realize the real-time

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,960
interaction between smart cards and

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,520
smart loads

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,320
and the developer active vehicle control

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,520
and rules

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,720
based on the collection and integration

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,200
integration of

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,320
dynamic traffic information in all time

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,240
and space

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,680
collaborative management to fully

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,640
realize

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,440
the effective coordination of people

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,160
vehicles and

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,839
roads and finally achieves the goal of

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,960
improving traffic

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,760
efficiency and ensuring traffic safety

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,359
this is the huge value handling hidden

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,800
behind the vehicle road

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:32,000
coordination now

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,079
let's say uh let's introduce the

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,280
trend of software different different

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,440
cars

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,839
automotive automobile intelligence

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,320
requires real-time processing of large

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,079
amount

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:51,839
of data from a computer vision

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:51,839
based on mountain seizure input

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,000
input high performance computing firstly

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,480
needs the

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,359
support of a new hardware at

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,160
architecture

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,280
and secondly it also needs to rely on a

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,480
new software

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,119
architecture to support cross-platform

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,320
computing and processing capabilities

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,119
high performance

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,000
miracle controller computing distributed

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,119
computing and

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,079
remote diagnose in the past term

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,720
the automotive ea has always followed

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,200
the one function one box distributed

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,280
architecture model in this form of

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,079
automotive electrical and

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,800
electron electrical cut articulator

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,680
every time

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,359
a function is added corresponding

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,960
controllers and the communication

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,480
signals need to be

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,560
added to further increase the system

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,400
the following two factors will reshape

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,680
the future eea

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,079
then look at the new generation of ea

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,640
the first is to support the system

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,920
integration of software

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,320
platforms also today's automotive ea can

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,200
be

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,560
classified into different domain domains

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,079
such as

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,440
information classics classes cheeses

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,880
and power chain the infotainment system

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,920
usually use linux

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,240
or commercial general

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
commercial general purpose operating

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,680
system

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,800
auto share classic platform is a

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,040
abandoned

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,320
ecu standard with strong real-time

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,440
performance

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,000
with the increasing demand for

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,280
computing power of new technologies and

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,960
the deep imbibing

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:45,119
system in the future the third

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:48,160
uh the server control controller is

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,079
and uh is urgently indeed the device

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,320
domain controller is used to

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,920
integrate the function known to form a

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,119
domain centralized

00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,720
all cross domain centralize the ea

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:04,160
the second is the transition

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,880
from signal based to service ocean the

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,880
communication traditional communication

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,240
is still signal based

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,920
that is the sender doesn't know doesn't

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,319
care who received data

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,280
but only sent to the signal and the

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,560
receiver

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,119
doesn't care who it is

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,319
it is only responsible for receiving

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,480
what you want

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,800
this method is very suitable for

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,280
application scenarios with limited

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,720
size control data after advanced

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,760
application

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,960
scenarios such as autonomous driving

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,119
are added the dynamical

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,280
interaction of large amounts of data

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,920
must adopt a service

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,640
a service oriented communication method

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,800
to improve

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,720
communication eventually and the reduced

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,839
load in this method

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,040
the receiver the receiver as a client

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,280
not not need to find and subscribe to

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,400
service and the width for it to be

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,880
received

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,359
information is enough and the sender as

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,839
a service provider only needs to

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,200
provide services and information to

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,680
subscribers

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,400
in the future with the substantial

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,880
growth of

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,680
automotive electronic and software

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,400
functions

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,319
it meant eventually developed a

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,160
development developed to

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,599
centralize the ea for vehicles based on

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,160
a central computer

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:33,599
or even vehicle road client computing

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,599
collaborative control

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,200
now under such a trend a new software

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,560
architecture platform

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,880
that is highly flexible high performance

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,000
and

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,200
sports high performance computing class

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
clusters dynamic uh dynamic com

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,960
communications and other features is

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,079
required

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,800
that is adaptive of auto shot

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,119
compared with the classic auto sham also

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,079
real-time requestments are reduced

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,319
but on this on the basic of ensuring a

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,319
certain functional safety level

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,079
the supporter for high performance

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,880
processing capability

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,839
is greatly improved to support the

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,319
development

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,359
of intelligence into connected

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,040
application

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:24,000
functions the image the

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,040
emergency of a adaptive autoshot is not

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,680
to replace

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,480
the classic autoshot platform but to

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,520
achieve

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,560
code in and the collaboration between

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,520
the two

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,359
four different application scenarios the

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,720
classical autoshop platform

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,599
supports high security and high relative

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,720
application scenarios therefore deep

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,440
imbalance software functions need to be

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,400
deployed and run in classic on the

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,880
platform

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,680
in short adaptive autoshiny area

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,280
realized

00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,000
the decoupling of software software and

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,560
hardware of the car and will eventually

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,880
promote

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,880
the realization of software descent car

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,760
um analysis of allocation

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,119
software software level the key

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,160
technologies of

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:21,839
autonomous driving can be divided into

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,920
three parts environment perception

00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,800
behavior decision making

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,599
path planning and motion control this

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,800
picture is

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:34,079
an example of an open autonomous driving

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,800
framework from left to right the first

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,440
step is collection collection and the

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,880
processing

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,920
of environmental information and

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,280
in vehicle information which is a basic

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,400
and pre-request uh

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,200
requested for autonomous driving our

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,319
inlet

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,599
intelligence vehicles in the middle of a

00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:00,560
prediction and the decision after opting

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,599
obtain in the surrounding environment

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,480
through sensor

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,920
recognition we must make full use of

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,680
this information to

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:12,880
understand and analysis

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,359
and decided how to take the next step

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,560
to accomplish this task is the most

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,880
powerful brain

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,319
in the past period of time where the

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,880
traditional oems

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,319
autonomous driving startups or

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,240
technology gains

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:31,920
they are basically based on intelligence

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,720
that is all sensors are computing

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,520
computing power units are mounted on

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,720
vehicles

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:42,720
due to the problem encountered by

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:45,119
intelligent vehicle in hyde

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,520
countries autonomous driving technology

00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,200
routes had begun to

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:55,599
tell in the direction of vehicle road

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,599
coordination in the past two years

00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,920
now let's talk about the vehicle to load

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,680
the collaboration

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,400
v2x metrox includes car to car

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,880
car to infrastructure car to internet

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,440
and car to pre

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,960
produce pedestrian through the vehicle

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,319
road collaboration

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,119
smart car opens up the external brand

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,560
provided rich timely and effective

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,839
information input

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,680
reduces the complexity of design making

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,960
gives the vehicle a good view and

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,079
reduces

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:35,839
the uncertainty of design-making

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,839
based on the request window to discuss

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,680
the

00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:42,720
s-o-t-i-f uh certif

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:46,200
at present the oem

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,880
and still are still in the earlier

00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,599
pre-research and the technical research

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,839
reserve

00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,880
stage for the road to vehicle

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,880
collaborative

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,240
automotive automatic driving

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,880
technologies

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,079
when working with software we found that

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,280
not all security

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,400
problems come from system

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,200
errors and failures in many cases

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,160
system security problems come from

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,240
environmental

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:17,359
impact and unexpected security problem

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,040
for the autonomous driving system the

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,280
system takes over

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,560
the control of the vehicle even if the

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,520
system doesn't

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,960
manufacture so the uncertainty of the

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,880
black box

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:33,839
output and may cause the function to

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,800
prevent and cause traffic injuries the

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,359
safety risk

00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,359
caused by the system function not meet

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,400
expectations in such

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,880
memphis conditions is the problem to be

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,319
solved

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,359
by the as expected expected from

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:53,359
functional safety sortif simply

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:56,480
put certificate focuses on avoiding

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,880
unreasonable risks due to

00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,400
expected functional performance

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,599
elimination

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,960
because saltifier was born in the

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,359
context

00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,240
of the development of intelligent

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,720
driving

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,160
if it is classified according to the

00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,599
foundational

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,800
change of intelligent driving

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,760
perception decision acquisition

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,040
functional performance limitations are

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,960
reflected

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,599
in the three in these three aspects

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,040
since unlimited only choosing recognized

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,559
arrows

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:38,880
including missed recognition of driving

00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:41,920
miss operation and the second is in

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,880
in for uh insuffic insufficient depot

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,559
lending caused the decision to charge

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,119
the sin

00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:54,319
incorrectly and the third is

00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,319
dimension from the ideal target

00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,599
and from another dimension functional

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:03,040
performance can be summarized

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:06,079
into four categories

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,040
the first is intervene in dangerous

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,520
situations

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,599
normal work and the second is intervene

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,000
in a nun

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,640
hazardous sin first trigger and the

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,119
third is

00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,000
do not intervene in dangerous sense

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,359
mistrigger and

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,359
the last is normal shutdown now we can

00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,680
see it can be seen

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,800
that there is no risk in the first and

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,520
the first cases and

00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,240
the second and the third cases are risky

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,839
therefore

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,839
this force trigger and miss the trigger

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:38,480
are the categories that sort of

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,400
need to be considered to effectively

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,200
avoid the first triggers and the missed

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,160
triggers the first step is to identify

00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,200
unclassified

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,400
things and determine which things will

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,520
trigger safety and

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,359
which sin will not trigger safety insult

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:58,319
insultive uh method methodology

00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,440
all scenarios are divided into following

00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,720
the following

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:06,000
four parts and the goal of

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,119
certified is to reduce air area to

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,839
know and safety and safe scenarios and

00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:16,160
areas through unknown unsafe scenarios

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:19,520
as much as possible

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,200
uh for area 2 no unsafe scenarios the

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,079
basic idea of

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,119
celtic is to identify risk scenarios

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,480
through safety

00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:31,599
and analysis developer can

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,040
control mirrors to risk scenarios build

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,200
a real-time simulation

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:40,400
environment for no scenarios or design

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:44,000
real vehicle tests and optimize

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:47,599
them based on experimental result

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,720
design for area 3 it is relatively

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,040
tricky to deal with for example this is

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,680
like

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,680
when we are developing a car that will

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,400
be put on the market in the future

00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,720
we need to identify in advance in

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,200
various scenarios that are common

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,000
encounter under all the underrated

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,119
controller

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,680
conditions in the early stage of the

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,720
development i think even if the world's

00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,640
top security

00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,480
experts sit down and associate the

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,359
answer the output

00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,200
will be difficult to safety to set it

00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:22,079
aside to satisfy

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,359
in order to let everyone feel know how

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,440
difficult

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,760
this problem is please see the following

00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,880
example tesla smart

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,480
driving function mistakenly identified

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,760
as a lockheed white circle

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,960
as a rodent block how it's how

00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,000
is sort of applied in the in the

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,440
development

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,359
of foley autonomous driving for the

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,839
assisted driving function the driver is

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,040
in the loop and the automatic driving

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:54,559
system provides

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,440
reasonable assistance to the short sale

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:59,359
system

00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:02,880
and the unsure sin is handed over

00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:06,400
to the provider reasonable

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,760
to the driver to take over so in

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,640
syria as long as we have enough tests

00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,200
data and the mixtures uh make sure that

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,800
the scene

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,480
is charged accurately covered with the

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,040
drivers feedback to

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,400
grasp the design direction we can

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,160
finally define

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:29,760
uh balance a balanced line clearly

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,240
so that the function knows design can be

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,280
not triggered and triggered to find the

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,400
balance point

00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,000
but if it is amended the driver is not

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,640
in the loop and the system

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,680
needs to be make adjustments in all

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,160
scenarios

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,040
which requires very high system

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,079
requirements

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,520
it is for example that with the help of

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:53,440
ivsis

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:56,480
the clan basically complex complexity

00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,680
of the automatic driving system can be

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,040
greatly reduced in fact in the country

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,720
autonomous driving

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,520
application cases in basic scenarios

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,880
the information from the field side

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,839
sensors can be

00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,280
can indeed effectively reduce the

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,559
complexity of the

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:22,000
automatic driving system

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,240
next up please let me introduce the

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,319
uh demonstration of location and

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,559
industry development management

00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,800
whether it is autonomous driving all

00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,440
intelligent network vehicles it should

00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,319
be said

00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,960
that there is still a long way to go in

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,559
the

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:42,559
choosing our autonomous driving

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:45,599
under various working conditions and

00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,720
various conditions for highly automated

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,319
driving it can be

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:53,280
used in specific scenarios such as

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,400
violent parking ports factory parts and

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,520
other specific

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,720
area and specific scenarios it is still

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,000
a

00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,960
completed a competitive point for mass

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,240
production production of autonomous

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,400
automobile

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,040
from the current development chains

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,520
there are two trends in the future

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,079
of autonomous driving the first is the

00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,880
addition

00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,000
of connected to autonomous driving first

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,440
it must

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,680
adapt to country's infrastructure

00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,559
including countries roads if

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,720
infrastructure

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,079
information is infrastructure and

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,680
countries my

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:35,280
my positioning and communications

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:38,800
they are completely local the second

00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,000
is that if the future automated driving

00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,800
is to be networked there will be a

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,680
networked operation platform and there

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,960
will be

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:52,319
a country standard for network operation

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,359
future automotive products and the pro

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:58,400
tech architecture will change at least

00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:02,559
the current ea will change

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:06,960
the ea over automobile has changed

00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,960
of course it is a new standard vehicle

00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,280
to truly promote autonomous driving in

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,480
the future

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,960
product forms will change there are five

00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,400
basic

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,920
platforms in the product form including

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:25,359
cloud control basic platform high

00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,240
precision dynamic markup based basic

00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,400
platform

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,119
vehicle terminal basic platform

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,760
computing basic platform and

00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,160
information security basic platform

00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,280
these

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,319
five platforms are new parts and new key

00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,920
information

00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:45,599
are new new important components for the

00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,960
new generation of automotive automotive

00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,079
products

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:54,000
the keyboard components of traditional

00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:56,000
automobiles are the engine power system

00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,839
drive system control system braking

00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,559
system and the german system

00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:02,160
in the future there are five major

00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:07,119
technology platforms

00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:10,319
on the system

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,520
now this is the end of my report if you

00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,000
have any req

00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,559
any questions or interest please contact

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,480
me at

00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:22,960
email uh see you idea australia

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,960
at alien.com thank you for listening

00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:32,720
[Music]

00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:36,160
uh brett i want to add one thing

00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:39,440
zooming thank you thank you for uh

00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,119
for the very good insight um i also want

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,160
to link this back to

00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,680
uh the work that's going on in a crano

00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,319
from a blueprint perspective

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,559
so there's a connected vehicle blueprint

00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:52,160
that has been released in release 2 and

00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,559
has been updated in release 3.

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,200
again it's a it's kind of an open source

00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,799
edge with

00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,040
mech with a v2x application

00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,400
that's run i think it's been tested on

00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,520
bare metal

00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,440
containers and vms and

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,079
from from a network side of things or

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,480
from a connected vehicle side of things

00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,680
uh the value that that blueprint

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,680
provides is obviously

00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,520
you know more accurate location i think

00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,599
it's 10x more accurate

00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,680
really smarter navigation you know

00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,960
safety improvements right so

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,559
uh risk mitigation etc and traffic

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,520
violations right so

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,400
as you can see uh from these vertical

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,240
groups

00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,480
uh not only do the vertical industries

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,520
in this case automotive that they're

00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,000
coming

00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,640
towards the network and towards open

00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,680
source

00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,440
but the open source industries like lfh

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,000
and foundations and projects

00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,640
they're moving closer to the vertical

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,319
and

00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,559
uh you know let's be honest you know a

00:56:51,319 --> 00:56:56,480
microservices

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,359
app developer java person who has coded

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,559
on

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:02,480
on on a normal i t system has no clue

00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,880
what this presentation was about

00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,079
and vice versa right so this is where

00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,960
this vertical solution

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,400
group is really really emphasizing to

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,240
bridge that gap so

00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,000
i just wanted to add that to sort of

00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,559
connect it back to lf edge and

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,640
how things are are working here so over

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,599
to you brett

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,720
perfect uh thank you again zhu ming and

00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,280
our pet

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,000
up next we have sriram with arna

00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,559
networks

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,240
presenting a use case on manufacturing

00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,880
and industrial

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,880
sriram

00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,200
hi everyone is my audio ok

00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,680
yes we can hear you all right great

00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,640
hi everyone morning good afternoon good

00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,760
evening

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,040
i'm sriram from anu networks uh so in

00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,839
this presentation i'm going to talk

00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,319
about

00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:54,319
uh the use case of manufacturing

00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:57,680
industrial in particular

00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,960
and how 5g edge and some of the nf

00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,799
projects

00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:06,640
facilitate that right so the first

00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:10,319
part of the presentation is about how 5g

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:13,520
enables the industry 4.0 so

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,640
so as you all know the 5g technologies

00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,839
there are three

00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:21,280
sort of major components right so the

00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:24,319
ultra reliable low latency communication

00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,079
the massive uh machine type uh

00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:28,880
communication and the network slicing

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:31,920
right so all three of them we believe

00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,559
are are very relevant for the industry

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,760
for our

00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,200
applications right so uh you know

00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,640
because some of them are pretty obvious

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,799
you know you need a very

00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,000
uh low latency communication for some of

00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:44,160
the uh

00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,160
industrial applications uh like

00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,559
manufacturing and so on

00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,079
um and similarly the massive mission

00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,760
type communications but there are going

00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,480
to be a lot of these devices

00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,760
that need to communicate so it makes a

00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,040
lot of sense to have

00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,680
a technology that supports that

00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,880
and the third one is a network slicing

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,040
which is a very

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,799
important feature in 5g which is

00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,240
very useful in the industrial

00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,160
applications

00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,440
where you may have different types of

00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,280
applications

00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,640
with the different characteristics or

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,359
different requirements

00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,160
so and that's exactly what the network

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,880
slicing will

00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,559
enable you to do you can create multiple

00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,720
slices one slice with uh

00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,160
you know low latency the other with the

00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,280
high bandwidth

00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:34,640
and and then they can all be supported

00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,440
on this on the same shop floor

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,760
seamlessly with 5g technology so these

00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,960
are

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:45,040
these are the technologies that enable

00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,839
industry 4.0 yeah you can go to the next

00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,839
slide

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,799
all right so now what are the uh what

00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,359
are the requirements

00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:57,599
for the industry forward zero right in

00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:00,720
terms of the 5g edge capabilities

00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,240
and why some of them cannot be done with

01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,559
some of the existing technologies

01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,319
right obviously people have been doing

01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,240
them right so why can't they be done

01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:10,319
with existing technologies right

01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,599
so these are the four categories that we

01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,799
believe uh our

01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:17,359
four requirements uh which which are

01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:20,480
required for the industry for auto

01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:22,079
and we'll also talk about why um they

01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,520
cannot be done with some of the existing

01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,720
technologies

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,359
so the first thing is reliable

01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,720
connectivity which is obviously a a

01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,839
requirement in the industrial

01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:33,280
environment

01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:36,720
um so ethernet can be done used

01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,559
but it's expensive and being wired it's

01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,960
hard to maintain

01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,559
and the wi-fi is the other option which

01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,119
can be used

01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,000
but again it doesn't provide the kind of

01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,880
reliability

01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,640
the low latency and the support for the

01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,280
different types of edge applications

01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,880
required and lastly the important thing

01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,240
the device management

01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,240
right so for this reason we believe

01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,640
um you know the you know these

01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,160
technologies may not be suitable for

01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,839
this next generation of these industrial

01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,440
applications

01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:10,079
and of course they can be used it's not

01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,520
that they will nobody will use them it's

01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,960
just that 5g makes it a lot

01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:18,160
easier for your capabilities

01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,880
the second category is the is edge iot

01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,720
frameworks

01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,079
right so there are some existing

01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,599
frameworks

01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:29,200
for example the aws has a green grass

01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:32,799
uh amazon has azure iot edge

01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:34,400
injects foundry um so

01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,280
they need to communicate and manage

01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,640
these devices so that will require some

01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:44,079
uh you know these technologies to

01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:46,480
be supported on these frameworks

01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,599
so so that will um that's that's another

01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,680
reason

01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:54,480
why the 5gh makes make sense in this

01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,880
in this domain the third is obviously

01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,319
the

01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:01,359
edge um the ai and ml

01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:03,119
so which is again another major driver

01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:05,200
right so a lot of the applications can

01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,400
be thought about in the industrial

01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:11,839
domain where the aiml

01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:14,400
can can provide inputs

01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:16,000
for the quality assurance machine

01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,200
analytics

01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,160
surveillance and many more right so

01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:24,640
this is not an extensive list um so

01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:27,520
these algorithms may be very dynamic

01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,319
um so you know it makes sense to have a

01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,359
framework

01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:34,240
or a technology that supports um you

01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:35,680
know these technologies ah aml are very

01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,119
seamless

01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,200
so that's the third uh requirement

01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,400
and the fourth one is the applications

01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,960
right so

01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,839
the edge can provide um lots of

01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,079
arbitrary applications which are cloud

01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:50,160
native right

01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,760
so tablet obviously applications are

01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,680
there um you know the existing

01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,440
applications are there

01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,599
but these cloud native applications

01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:01,119
which are built ground up

01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:04,480
uh as cloud native um you know such as

01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:07,039
augmented reality proactive maintenance

01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,520
drone control um the vehicle control

01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,799
that

01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,359
you know the previous presentation

01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,000
talked about for autonomous vehicles

01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,440
so all of these applications um again

01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,880
you know will require

01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,039
cloud native nature and

01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,960
so these are the capabilities that 5g

01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,400
and edge can provide

01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,880
which are required for these industrial

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,119
4.0 applications so essentially what

01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,680
this tries to convey is that

01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,480
you know 5g is a is the most suitable

01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,920
technology

01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,920
for for this domain but this use case

01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,839
you can go to the next slide

01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,480
all right so in this particular

01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,440
presentation um i'm going to focus on

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,760
the

01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,079
application management problem right so

01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,160
obviously the industry 4.0 has

01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,760
you know many many problems and there

01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,799
are many solutions

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,920
some of them could be using the other

01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,559
lf uh projects but what i'm going to

01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,079
focus

01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,000
on in this presentation is the

01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,480
application management problem

01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,680
right now what are the requirements for

01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,440
the application management

01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:20,400
in the industry right and why

01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,280
uh you know how they can be uh satisfied

01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,640
with some of the

01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,559
uh um existing projects

01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,760
so that's that's how the uh that's how

01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,000
i'm going to present this

01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,799
right so the first requirement is a

01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,440
reliable

01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:34,720
5g management in all my factories right

01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,920
so that's that's kind of a basic

01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,920
requirement

01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,960
um so there should be a zero touch

01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,760
provisioning

01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,359
right so a lot of factories you know may

01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,520
not even have the accessibility for

01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:47,920
people to go and provision things

01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,839
so pretty much zero touch provisioning

01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,920
is is a requirement

01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,880
uh network slicing that i talked about

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,559
in the earlier

01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,640
um slides right so there are

01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,400
there's a requirement to have you know

01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,920
different types of applications having

01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,480
different characteristics

01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,079
which exactly is what the slicing will

01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,000
sound

01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,920
and the ongoing optimizations you know

01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,079
you may want to keep optimizing things

01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,280
for for better efficiencies in the

01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,760
factories

01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,039
uh and the last thing uh last kind of

01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,760
sub item in this is the

01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,400
automatic uh corrective action right the

01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,960
self service assurance for example

01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,400
based on certain inputs you may want to

01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,039
take some corrective actions

01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,160
in an automatic way without any manual

01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,000
intervention

01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,280
right so these are pretty much the

01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,680
requirements

01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,480
for for any industrial applications to

01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,880
solve

01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,760
in terms of the application management

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,359
so that's the first

01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:46,240
category the second category is uh

01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:47,599
uh you know how do i manage my

01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,039
applications right

01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,200
so let's say i've deployed my

01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,440
applications now that's not enough

01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,039
right so once i do the initial

01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,960
orchestration i have to keep

01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,160
configuring them i have to keep managing

01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,280
them i have to do the lifecycle

01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,640
management

01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,480
and i have to upgrade some other

01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,440
software um

01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,920
so all of these life cycle management

01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,920
items

01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,280
you know scale up scale out all of that

01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,200
right and selfies

01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,880
in the service assurance and the

01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,240
termination of one completion

01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,039
so these are the things that are

01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,680
required um to manage my applications on

01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:23,280
an ongoing basis

01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:26,160
the third one is uh you know the

01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,520
the need to be you know fully automated

01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,440
uh with one click

01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:34,559
right now you know this can be done

01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,799
um with you know the existing ad hoc

01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,640
scripts homegrown applications

01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:40,400
so these are all problems that are

01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,280
solved already right

01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,400
but the point here is that uh when you

01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,640
go to

01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,400
uh you know you know you're okay with

01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,160
tens of such applications right when you

01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,559
go to hundreds of thousands of these

01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,240
multiple factories right with the

01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,079
different types of applications each of

01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,799
them having their own way of managing

01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,559
things

01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:00,319
you know their own way of you know

01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:03,039
vendor tools

01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:03,359
um so you can imagine the kind of you

01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,160
know

01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:08,000
complexity that gets involved in this so

01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:11,039
you need a fully automated way

01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,640
with one click you can configure a whole

01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,240
bunch of these devices

01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,599
with certain set of parameters and uh

01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,760
and being able to scale you know when

01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,400
you go to when you start

01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,760
these new applications or expand to your

01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,079
factories

01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,280
um you know you want to be able to scale

01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,520
it

01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,559
so these are the application management

01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,799
problems

01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,000
um you know obviously these are these

01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,240
are the problems in any

01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,839
you know in most of the domains but in

01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,760
industrial domain these are

01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:41,200
clearly some things that that need to be

01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,240
solved by the

01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,920
by the operations manager in the factory

01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,960
so this is all sort of building a case

01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:51,440
for how 5g edge can be

01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,680
is a is an ideal solution for this

01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,680
problem

01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,160
and go to the next slide

01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,720
all right so this is one of the

01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,760
solutions you know obviously it's not

01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,280
the only solution

01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,280
um so i'm i'm going to talk about uh

01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,359
some of the technologies that we

01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,559
leverage for for this uh

01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:14,640
especially in the context of the

01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:17,600
elephant edge

01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,719
projects the requirements is that it has

01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,480
to be

01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:23,920
lightweight uh cloud native uh the cacd

01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,120
release process is pretty much a

01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,239
requirement

01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,000
in this domain they have to be vendor

01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:32,319
agnostic

01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,880
that's the reason why people choose open

01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:38,239
source technologies

01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:41,440
where the cnfs and then the kubernetes

01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:43,600
providers can be vendor agnostic the

01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,799
access technology uh again you know in

01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,719
this presentation we're going to talk

01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:49,520
about mostly about 5g but

01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,080
it can also be used for lte wi-fi uh

01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,759
maybe

01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,199
there need be support for the kubernetes

01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,759
nfva clouds

01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:58,719
um and then the the projects that are

01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,719
used

01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,640
for the uh the open source projects that

01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,120
are used uh from lfn

01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,719
um mostly for the one app project and

01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:10,000
that's what i'm going to focus on this

01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,120
presentation which are applicable for

01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,080
this uh

01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,080
you know for this solution

01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,040
if you can go to the next slide yeah so

01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,960
these are some of the details

01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,080
and again this is uh this is more

01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,400
generic it's not

01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,759
specific to the industrial applications

01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,159
but again all these

01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:29,279
uh requirements are pretty much needed

01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:31,920
for uh

01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,799
you know for for this domain where you

01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,640
need to have the

01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,400
cluster registration because you need to

01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,640
have there may be need for multiple

01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,560
clusters that need to register

01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,319
distributed application scheduler

01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,080
because you know your applications may

01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,480
be scheduled on multiple

01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,239
clusters in the factories you need to be

01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,960
able to schedule them uh

01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:52,000
you know based on the intents you know

01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,359
you may say that

01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,120
certain applications have certain

01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,719
requirements and they need to be placed

01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:59,199
in certain types of

01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,800
um you know these these clusters so

01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,480
these are these are the requirements

01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,239
that are um

01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,080
that are clearly there for for the

01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,400
industrial applications

01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,000
and in the third thing is the the

01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,080
platform awareness

01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,800
so certain clusters may support certain

01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,600
hardware features and that's that's

01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,760
clearly

01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,760
something that may that may be prevalent

01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,760
in the industrial applications

01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,679
where there are certain specialized

01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,080
clusters

01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,080
with certain capabilities where certain

01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,600
applications can run

01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,760
and obviously nobody's going to decide

01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,120
that manually where this would run

01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,679
right so all of this should be built

01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,920
into the into the software

01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,600
uh distributed cloud manager which you

01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,000
know

01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,239
can can present a single view for

01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,040
example you have multiple factories

01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:51,360
and the clouds that are distributed uh

01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:55,600
and the ability to manage them as

01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:58,640
a as a single logical cloud across them

01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,560
the mesh controllers secure van

01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,800
controllers and monitoring

01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,520
so again these are all the features um

01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:09,360
that are that are required for these 5gh

01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:11,840
solutions um which which are

01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,520
clearly a requirement for the industrial

01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,520
applications

01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,960
even though they are more generic and

01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,640
may be applicable for the other

01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,640
other verticals as well

01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,840
yeah you can go to the next slide

01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,120
all right so now i'm going to talk about

01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,440
a couple of

01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,120
um you know proof of concept projects

01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,840
that are that are going on in the

01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,960
uh in the community um so these are all

01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,159
uh

01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,600
in the sort of using the open source

01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:46,480
initiatives uh from the

01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,840
from the elephant projects um in the

01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,040
next few slides i talk

01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,800
and talk about the specific projects

01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,400
that are that are used and the companies

01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,480
that are involved in this

01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,760
so the first poc is a private private

01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:01,280
lte 5g

01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:03,920
uh with the mech um so this is uh

01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,600
uh this is under the rhino uh blueprint

01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,480
or one of the external blueprints

01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,280
uh that's uh that's in in progress right

01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,760
now it's not

01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,280
uh it's not complete yet um so

01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,040
essentially what we're trying to do here

01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:18,480
is to build an end-to-end

01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,400
uh solution with 5g um it can also be

01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,199
with private lte but

01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,760
and then move to 5g um so where we are

01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:27,600
taking

01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:30,560
you know creating two or more edges

01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,840
in a core um with all of them running

01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,440
kubernetes

01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,440
and running different um 5g applications

01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:39,199
so some of them are cnf some of them are

01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,199
cnas

01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,719
but they're all cloud native

01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:45,199
applications

01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:47,040
uh which are orchestrated using uh open

01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:49,199
applicatis

01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,480
which is a orchestrator that's part of

01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:53,280
the

01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,239
opponent project or in the multi-cloud

01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,520
project

01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:58,239
um so that's the one that we are

01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:02,080
leveraging to to orchestrate

01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:04,159
these these container functions and

01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,920
the goal of the poc is to show an

01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:08,480
end-to-end communication

01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,880
uh and and you know accessing the data

01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:13,360
networks using these end devices

01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,400
uh and again like i said it's not this

01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,520
is not complete yet

01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,320
um it's still in progress um so we have

01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,239
a bunch of

01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,679
companies that are uh that are part of

01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:23,440
this uh blueprint

01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,199
that are working on it and you can see

01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:29,520
the names here um

01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:31,360
and there's a techno page that has a lot

01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,280
more details on

01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,120
the current state of empires where what

01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,040
we are using and what technologies have

01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:40,159
been used and so on

01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,760
um and uh and then you know

01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:43,199
those interested uh you know obviously

01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,400
can can

01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:48,239
be part of this um

01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,400
so now i will talk about the the the

01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:52,800
other poc if you can go to the next

01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,800
slide

01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,239
all right so this is the second uh poc

01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:04,560
which is uh which is actually

01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:05,440
um um uh in a much more advanced stage

01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,480
in terms of the

01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:11,600
um the

01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:15,840
capabilities this was a part of this was

01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,840
actually shown in the

01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:20,880
this is being demonstrated um so

01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,440
essentially what we are doing here is

01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,800
that

01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:28,000
um so we have two locations

01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:31,520
uh the one is the unh lab where we have

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,960
the nfi hardware which is the hp

01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:37,040
servers and we have open source

01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,600
kubernetes that's running on that

01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,400
and that's the cloud that's used for it

01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,760
and

01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,520
the own app for kds uh is is run on that

01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,640
and that's the one that's orchestrating

01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,400
all these uh

01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:53,679
uh cnns and uh this sd-wan

01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:56,320
um is uh from from tonium is connecting

01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,760
that with uh with another cloud which is

01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,960
running in a montreal

01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:04,159
lab and and

01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,400
there um also it's nfa hardware has a

01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:09,040
bunch of servers and switches

01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,000
and uh so they're instead of running the

01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,920
open source kubernetes

01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,480
we're running the red hats openshift

01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,400
version of the kubernetes and that's

01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:21,520
where we have instantiated

01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,159
a bunch of these network functions from

01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,280
a10

01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:28,000
from ultron and

01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,199
so essentially using um the one effort

01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,960
here it is

01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:34,719
so we orchestrate these services

01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,920
um and again those interested you know

01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:38,400
the demo recording is available they can

01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,520
they can

01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,640
take a look at it um so this uses

01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:47,440
ultron's 5g core and

01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,400
the gnb emulator from ultron and also

01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,320
another

01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:54,719
company called rebaka

01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,400
so these are the ones that we have uh

01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,400
demonstrated the interoperability of

01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:01,440
this

01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:04,400
and uh and again the the the

01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,440
open source uh management that's used

01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,360
for this

01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,360
is the own app for kds which is part of

01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:13,440
the

01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:17,040
umbrella so this is the second

01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:18,880
poc that's um that's that's

01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,480
so we still want to keep adding more

01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,480
capabilities to this

01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,640
uh so this is still a work in progress

01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:27,120
even though we made a lot of progress

01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,360
um so we want to show the end to end

01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,920
with uh with a

01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,560
real radio and so on um so that's in

01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,760
progress

01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,320
so right now we're showing it with

01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,600
emulators but eventually we want to show

01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,960
it with the real

01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,199
hardware and with network slicing

01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,800
so that's that's the uh that's the end

01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:47,520
goal of

01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,360
this which is which is in progress and

01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,520
again a lot of companies are involved in

01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,520
this

01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,640
red hat open shift uh 18

01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,640
ultron

01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:06,960
we are involved as owner um

01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:07,920
so so these are the uh these are the

01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,960
companies that are

01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,960
that are part of this issue

01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,840
you can go to the next slide please

01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,520
all right so i think these are the

01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,840
technology partners in this poc

01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,280
um you know i mentioned some of them

01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,679
already

01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,480
so some of them are already part of the

01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:32,159
the poc

01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:34,560
the others are in various stages

01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:35,520
of you know bringing their their

01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:40,320
software

01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:40,320
to this um you know obviously the

01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,480
cloud platform is the kubernetes um open

01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:50,080
source communities are

01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:51,440
red hat open shift and uh uh the one app

01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:54,320
for k it is

01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:56,080
uh is the other other component the

01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,199
other

01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,719
configuration piece that we're going to

01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:04,159
use for

01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:05,040
life cycle management is a is a project

01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:08,080
called cds

01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,800
in in again you know that's another open

01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,320
source uh

01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,560
project which is uh which facilitates

01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,840
the life cycle management of the cnns or

01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,320
cmas

01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,520
um so that's the one that's still in

01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,960
working progress

01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,440
so we haven't started the configuration

01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,840
part yet so what we have demonstrated so

01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,920
far

01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,600
is the is the orchestration where you

01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,880
can bring up all these cnfs on these

01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,360
clouds

01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,760
um but the actual configuration and the

01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:36,960
service assurance

01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:39,840
using using closed loops and using the

01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:42,000
network slicing is something that that

01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,000
we are working towards

01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,600
so that's uh that's where things are

01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,159
with uh with this project

01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,159
at the moment

01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,199
all right i think uh that's probably the

01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,080
last

01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:56,080
slide i think

01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,880
ah perfect so folks if you have

01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,719
questions for sriram

01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,320
um i do see contact information on this

01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:06,960
slide but while we

01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,960
have them here um please leverage the q

01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,640
a window

01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,239
i think it's either your lower toolbar

01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,239
or for some browsers might be upper

01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,440
and if you're unable to find the q a box

01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,480
if you can find the chat box we'll take

01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,480
questions that way as well

01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,400
all right not seeing anything come

01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,920
across but we do have the contact

01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,199
information here

01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,440
um should there be any questions that

01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:46,719
come up later

01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:51,120
and uh i think uh with that

01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:54,719
uh thank you again sriram um up next

01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,760
uh we have a yun jun chen from china

01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,840
mobile

01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:03,440
with a telco use case

01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:07,280
erin if you can click ahead

01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:11,360
hello everyone my name is ian jin chun

01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:13,920
i'm from china mobile research institute

01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,280
thanks for attending this session and

01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,600
today

01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,320
i will give some sharings on the

01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,560
progress

01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:25,600
made by china mobile on edge computing

01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,040
including edge computing strategy the

01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,679
technical focus

01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:32,320
as well as a vertical solution

01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:35,040
development roadmap ok

01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,040
let's start

01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:46,159
as one of the telcos who has launched

01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:49,920
commercial 5g network

01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:54,719
services china mobile has announced

01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:57,840
5g plus aicde development strategy

01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,880
which aicde means artificial

01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,480
intelligence

01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:06,719
iot cloud computing big data

01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:11,199
edge computing and while

01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:14,159
the e represents the edge computing

01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,280
it's one of the key capabilities of 5g

01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:19,520
network

01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:22,719
and thanks to 5g core network design

01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:24,159
on flexible placement of the user plan

01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:27,760
functions

01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:30,960
upf so with the user plan

01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,920
closer to end users it misses

01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,520
requirements

01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:39,679
on load latency high bandwidth

01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:42,880
data security and high quality

01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:46,400
of service network for both to be and

01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:48,960
to see service customers

01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,000
in addition not only their network

01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,719
services

01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,639
channel mobile also provides the cloud

01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,840
services to both individual

01:21:54,639 --> 01:22:00,960
and enterprises customers and we will

01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:04,080
offer these cloud services at edge site

01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:07,040
but more adapted to the edge side

01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,239
so the strategy is to provide the

01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,360
network

01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:14,560
edge and cloud one stop solutions

01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,560
to our customers

01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:21,520
um to go to a little bit more details

01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:24,080
for 5g network services channel mobile

01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:27,520
have the following technical focus

01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:28,960
to provide the high quality of network

01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,320
services to enable

01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:33,120
edge computing so first is the edge

01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:37,199
traffic

01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:41,520
offload service which will be enabled by

01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:45,760
techniques like network slicing

01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:49,199
dn configuration or uplink classifier

01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,760
in routine policy another technical

01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:53,280
focus

01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:56,719
is to provide the network features

01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,960
by open apis network capabilities such

01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,280
as the access control

01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:05,280
the bandwidth controller and radio

01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:08,480
network information services etc

01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:11,520
in addition 5gsa standalone

01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:15,520
private networking solution is offered

01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:18,719
to enterprise customers for high quality

01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,719
network requirements

01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:25,120
uh at the end on the other hand

01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:26,239
regarding their edge computing cloud

01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:29,760
services

01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:33,120
channel mobile has provided a full stack

01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:35,760
cloud services for customers for

01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,520
the edge infrastructure it will be

01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,639
benefit from

01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:44,480
the idc resources owned by

01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:45,280
telcos like us while in those idc data

01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,560
center

01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:51,840
both virtualized infrastructure such

01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,679
as the virtual machine or docker

01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,400
container resources

01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:58,880
or bare metal infrastructure could be

01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:01,440
offered to our customer

01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,120
in addition the hardware capabilities

01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:06,480
should be customizable

01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:10,000
according to different solution needs

01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:12,800
and if we go to the upper layer

01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,440
in path layer and channel mobile has

01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,880
announced

01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:21,440
the new edge computing

01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:24,080
path platform named sigma um

01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,719
for sigma platform it will offer groups

01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:28,480
of

01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:31,199
capabilities to end users including

01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,280
like network capabilities such as

01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:36,639
location services

01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:39,679
bandwidth management service and

01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:42,960
ue access control service

01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:44,800
those are core features enabled by telco

01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,159
service players

01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:51,440
from telco network's capabilities

01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:54,400
and also in this past platform

01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,920
general functions such as database dns

01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:59,679
configuration or

01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:03,120
message brokers are common features for

01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:06,960
majority of applications

01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,960
and for vertical capabilities

01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,800
channel mobile now is actively working

01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:13,040
with

01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,560
vertical solution partners

01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:17,920
[Music]

01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:19,120
vertical capabilities such as video

01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,000
analytics

01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:23,679
and artificial intelligence capabilities

01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,560
like nlp

01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,520
so all those capabilities will be

01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,920
exposed

01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:35,920
by api gateway and also this api gateway

01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:38,840
will will be responsible for

01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,159
the capabilities registration

01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,760
deregistration

01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:47,520
handle the load balance use

01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,520
user authentication etc

01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:53,760
um in the set layer

01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,199
it includes variety of edge computing

01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:59,199
service applications

01:25:55,199 --> 01:26:02,159
such as internet of vehicle arvr

01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:02,800
cloud gaming etc and channel mobile is

01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:06,080
mainly

01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:09,840
working with partners together to offer

01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,840
end-to-end solutions

01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:17,360
um if we see the whole framework

01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,639
we can see the edge computing is a full

01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:22,239
stack

01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:26,000
technical framework from network

01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:29,560
deployment to platform setup

01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,280
to service enablement service

01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:34,840
development

01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:37,760
it's a very complex and long-term

01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,800
process so regarding the key process

01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,000
made by

01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,560
channel mobile on edge computing

01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,920
commercialization

01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:50,320
there are four summarizes in both

01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:54,000
network site and platform service site

01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:57,280
first things upf user

01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,639
plane function traffic offloading is

01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,360
the very important first hub for edge

01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,560
computing

01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:08,239
in 5g network so china mobile has

01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:11,360
announced the open upf white paper

01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:14,800
and proposed to open info inter

01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,159
interface to decapoid from 5g core

01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,800
network

01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:21,440
so this proposal will allow telco

01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:24,880
players to have more flexibility

01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:27,840
on upf solution as well as the upf

01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,840
integrating with platform solutions to

01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,719
avoid the vendor lock

01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,760
so this is the first progress made by

01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:37,280
channel mobile

01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:40,960
and second um we're working with

01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:44,719
hardware companies to customize

01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:47,920
on gener generic server general servers

01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:49,199
for adapting different age data center

01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,639
environment

01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:56,000
so those redesigned edge hardwares

01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:59,360
are commercialized and we have purchased

01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,679
some of them third

01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:04,320
channel mobile has announced the edge

01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:07,120
computing path platform sigma

01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:08,480
as i mentioned in the last slide while

01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,199
in this platform

01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,760
telco featured capabilities are exposed

01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:15,760
by

01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:19,440
api gateway and service trials

01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:20,320
have been made to test and verify this

01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,520
platform

01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:26,880
with real use cases such as

01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:29,920
we have used a sigma platform to

01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,880
control auto guide vehicles in a smart

01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,920
factory

01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:37,199
to improve the traditional solutions

01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,560
and um sigma platform is also verified

01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,960
in the case of

01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,679
processing on edge side video camera

01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,800
streaming

01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:48,080
for product quality auto

01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:51,199
inspection in smart factory

01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:53,679
in addition china mobile is also active

01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:54,480
in many open source communities to

01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:57,760
embrace

01:28:54,480 --> 01:29:01,280
the open source ecosystem and share

01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,920
visions with industries and we propose

01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,719
to

01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,679
work together with ecosystem partner

01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:09,120
partners

01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:10,000
on solving some key and common technical

01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,719
issues

01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,400
on edge computing finding potential edge

01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:18,080
computing use cases

01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:20,800
etc so those are the four

01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:22,400
key technological progress made by

01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:26,239
channel mobile

01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:27,760
edge computing topic regarding the last

01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:29,360
point open source community

01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,719
participation

01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:35,760
um the participation in linux foundation

01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:38,400
edge project equinox is one of the

01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,840
key activities in open source community

01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:43,679
related with

01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:47,199
ed computing currently

01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:50,719
acronym has released the r3 version

01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:53,360
and in a stage of planning r4 release

01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,719
and china mobile are leading two

01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,639
blueprints

01:29:54,719 --> 01:30:02,719
in r3 version in the blueprint of

01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:06,480
cloud gaming and arm-based

01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:08,480
solutions are investigated to

01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:11,120
provide the android application

01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:14,960
solutions at edge site

01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:17,679
and another one is

01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,360
smart nic blueprint it's demonstrated

01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:23,920
the 5g upf can

01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:23,920
use this smart technique to ex

01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:30,480
accelerate the performance

01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:32,239
just recently we have joined the

01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:35,760
technical steering committee

01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:39,360
of acronym 2020 to 2021

01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:42,480
and china mobile will continue actively

01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:45,040
participate and contribute to this

01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:47,520
open source project to this open source

01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:51,040
community

01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:54,800
um in addition to

01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:58,159
promote the industry development

01:30:54,800 --> 01:31:01,120
and to accelerate the maturity of

01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:03,440
ash computing ecosystem channel mobile

01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:07,440
have launched has launched

01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:11,280
over 100 service trials in over 12

01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:14,320
provinces in china those service trials

01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:17,679
cover the main application categories

01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:20,880
including smart energy health care

01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:24,159
education government smart traffic

01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:25,199
smart manufacturers etc and those

01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:28,400
service trials

01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:30,560
are the real use cases from

01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,239
our customers in different vertical

01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,480
areas

01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:36,800
through these service trials china

01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:39,920
mobile has got the best practice

01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:42,480
on network deployment and

01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,760
deeper understanding on customers

01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:46,800
requirements

01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:50,080
in different vertical areas

01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:53,600
and we get to know the end-to-end

01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:56,159
performance and if there are some open

01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:58,000
issues etc

01:31:56,159 --> 01:32:00,639
so those service trials are still

01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,199
ongoing and will continue

01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:05,920
extending to more use cases in more

01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:10,080
locations

01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:13,520
um so this page it shows

01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:16,960
a service trial example we did together

01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:20,719
with another game solution partner in

01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:24,000
sutran province in china in this

01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:27,040
service trial delay tolerance

01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,560
is very sensitive especially

01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:33,280
for the case when there is a game event

01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:35,120
while at that time many users will

01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:38,480
connect to the server together

01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:42,639
for real-time competing

01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:45,760
and for big game invent normally hosted

01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:50,239
in like in the university the delay

01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:53,360
tolerance is around 25 milliseconds

01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:56,960
so in this use case we have

01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:59,040
deployed 5g standalone core network

01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,280
to guarantee the normal game user

01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:03,679
experience

01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,639
in addition to guarantee the user

01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:08,000
experience of

01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:11,280
get invent users on the upf

01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,760
has been deployed in chengdu city

01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:14,960
which is in the capital of citron

01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,080
province

01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:22,159
so that again event users can

01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:25,280
directly send requests and get response

01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:28,320
from the game servers deployed together

01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:31,679
with this upf located

01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:34,719
in situa located in chengdu so it is

01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:37,920
more closer to user side

01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:41,440
so the delay is very small

01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:44,719
so this is uh one of the typical

01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:46,400
use cases we have trials on edge

01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,120
computing

01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,639
in addition china mobile also made the

01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:54,239
new practice on

01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,960
computing business incubation partners

01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:58,800
can make

01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:00,719
full use of channel mobile's 5g network

01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,840
as well as the cloud services to

01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,840
implement

01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:09,840
the service applications and verify

01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:13,760
the end-to-end solutions and evaluate

01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:17,120
the performance etc

01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:20,480
so we will continuously welcome

01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:23,840
new partners join this incubation plan

01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:26,960
plan and let's make effort together to

01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,159
accelerate the industrial development on

01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,600
edge computing

01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:34,719
and promote the ecosystem maturity in

01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,920
in variable ways okay that's all that i

01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,320
prepared today

01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,320
thank you

01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:49,840
yeah hi this is tina tina joe

01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:53,360
the aquino tse chair so uh

01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:56,560
brad asked me to say something about

01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:59,600
the channel mobile deployment has been

01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:03,280
already developed in equino

01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:05,920
so yeah for the previous slide

01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:08,560
yanjing has already shown they have

01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,840
already been leading the iec type three

01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:13,360
and five

01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:15,920
the uh android cloud gaming

01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:19,119
and also this monique blueprint they

01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:22,400
have been participating in the 5g mac

01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:26,000
and public cloud edge and also

01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:29,600
out edge and also the

01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,520
the edit blueprint so uh thank you for

01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,920
channel mobile's contribution this is

01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,679
really useful and leading the industry

01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:39,360
especially the token

01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:41,520
areas to move to the deployment and also

01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:43,520
uh they are now proposing a new

01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,520
blueprint or blueprint family

01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:50,239
which is called uh something like uh

01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,600
blockchain based uh edge computing

01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:54,080
because they already have

01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,440
some uh proof of concept already

01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:59,280
building so i see

01:35:55,440 --> 01:36:02,239
china mobile sets up a very good example

01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,880
how to have the closed loop between

01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:07,360
project

01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:10,480
production and profit as of edge

01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,880
advocates all right uh i will stop at

01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,920
that

01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:16,719
um thank you for your attention

01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,520
and participants any questions uh i'm

01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:21,280
here to

01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:24,960
answer live or type the answers

01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:26,639
hey tina um and yan jun

01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,880
we actually have a couple of questions

01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:30,239
so why don't we address those before we

01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:33,280
move on

01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:35,199
sure um so the first one is could you

01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,360
explain a little bit more about the

01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:40,080
answer of the first question please this

01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:43,520
was from crystal ball

01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:47,119
for the satellite yes exactly about

01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:52,000
satellites and contributing to 5g

01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:54,800
yeah he's uh um it's not

01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,600
well there's no directly satellite uh

01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,199
discussion

01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:02,080
in ukraine however i wish this satellite

01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:03,280
uh representative from study group 11

01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,400
itot

01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:09,840
it's always like supplemented to the

01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:12,159
uh to the 5g 4g 3g at that time

01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,600
the cellular networks cellular

01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:16,960
technologies

01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,000
so they don't usually they don't like it

01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:21,199
co exist

01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,400
at the same time however for some

01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:27,520
rural area you probably heard

01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:30,639
facebook's leading activity

01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:34,600
initiative called magma it takes

01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:38,159
care of this other uh

01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:40,080
non-cellular uh connectivities

01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:41,360
which could be supplemented when there

01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,560
is no uh

01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:48,080
normal 5g4 glte signals

01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:51,760
in some rural areas and countries

01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,760
and regions

01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,119
great thank you we do have one other

01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,840
question how is

01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:00,639
5g multi-homing being interpreted in the

01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,560
cloud

01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,159
when multiple physical paths will have

01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,800
different latencies before being

01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:07,280
combined

01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:09,440
back into a single data flow is there a

01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,960
cross layering technique between the mac

01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:14,400
phy and the upper

01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:16,480
network layers yeah so the 5g

01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:19,600
multi-homing is always

01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:22,960
a very interesting topic

01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:26,000
we've already seen uh we

01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:27,440
like in the public cloud edge interface

01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,159
brooklyn family

01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:35,440
we get the microsoft

01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:37,760
equinix att channel mobile china unicom

01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,719
uh they were there uh discussing the

01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:43,199
multi-cloud

01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:46,320
and also the multi-tenancy

01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:48,239
and multi-homing uh issues questions

01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:51,920
there you're welcome to join

01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:54,960
um the when the multiple physical paths

01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:58,320
there um yes there may be uh

01:38:54,960 --> 01:39:01,119
having the different latencies and

01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,960
before it's combined back into a single

01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:06,800
data flow i think

01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:09,920
it takes the um i would say in the mass

01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:13,040
is the the combined set the longest

01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:16,800
longest latency place there

01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:18,000
this is the current the status quad of

01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,360
the industry

01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,280
however we see the uh

01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,400
the telcos and the vendors they're

01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,679
trying to fix

01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:31,040
this issue to see whether the latency

01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:33,840
could be in the medium value

01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:34,880
of the different latencies you also ask

01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,520
whether there's a cross

01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,480
layering techniques yes we do see the

01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,600
microfiber

01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:44,800
and optical cross layer

01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,760
synergy the technology developed in both

01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,119
itf

01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:53,760
and itu study group 15.

01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:56,880
and once this technology all build up

01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,560
equino is happy to integrate them into

01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:02,159
the 5g mac

01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:05,119
and the icn

01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:05,119
and the iec

01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,639
and the pc public cloud edge interface

01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:11,840
brooklyn families

01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:14,560
i hope it answers some of your questions

01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,560
great thank you

01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:21,280
all right well thank you again to yanjun

01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,960
and tina

01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:24,719
and as well as the questions over the

01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:28,320
window

01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:31,679
up next eric if or aaron i'm sorry if

01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,679
you don't mind advancing

01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,239
there we go we have a use case on

01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:38,560
transportation and logistics

01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:39,520
we have eric and name joining us from

01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,719
ibm

01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:43,280
and before they move into their

01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:46,239
presentation we actually have a

01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:48,560
a short youtube video to play for the

01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:51,840
audience so

01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:53,920
we'll see how well the the internet

01:40:51,840 --> 01:41:04,080
treats the video play and aaron i just

01:40:53,920 --> 01:41:06,400
dropped it over the chat

01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,400
sorry

01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:19,840
i think

01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,199
an error uh aaron i think you need to

01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:33,840
share the video screen that there we go

01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:33,840
we had the presentation

01:41:52,820 --> 01:43:12,620
[Music]

01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,719
all right thanks aaron uh we are going

01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,679
to stop sharing your video

01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:24,719
so that uh eric i believe you should be

01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:28,320
able to take over

01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:30,800
yeah can you hear me okay yes yes

01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:32,239
okay i'm trying to share my screen

01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:35,040
perfect

01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:36,880
are you seeing something we are we are

01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:39,600
at your title slide

01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,639
okay great so uh you've just seen a

01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,880
little video

01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:45,119
and we're gonna go into the inside of

01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:47,760
that very interesting edge

01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:48,159
and i um i'd like to start by saying

01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:51,920
that

01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:54,400
so i work in ibm and i have with me

01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,840
a very smart guy called name name what

01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:58,719
on you

01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,719
yes hello everyone

01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:05,040
okay so uh how much time do i do we have

01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,639
15 minutes

01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,080
uh we're actually ahead of schedule so

01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:11,760
you can go a little bit over if you need

01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:14,800
okay so we're gonna go short but we have

01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:18,159
a lot to share if you're ready for it

01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,800
so and i will start so hopefully the

01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:22,320
chart will

01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:25,280
move when i click yes so uh this is the

01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:28,239
ship we're talking about so it's a

01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:30,639
it's a ship that's going to commemorate

01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:32,719
the the mayflower crossing

01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:34,159
the anniversary was 16 of september and

01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,440
you know it got delayed because of the

01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:38,800
covet but it will

01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:40,560
cross in in springtime uh

01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:42,560
the first mission is then to cross the

01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,760
atlantic and also to carry science

01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,239
experiment

01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,280
you can see on the drawing on the bottom

01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:52,080
right

01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:54,400
it's a very slim low on water

01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:56,560
powered by solar batteries there is

01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:59,440
obviously a backup generator or ship so

01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,880
it has no sales okay it's propelled by a

01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:03,760
propeller

01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:06,880
and it has absolutely no place for human

01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:10,719
beings on board so no cabin no

01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:13,440
deck and it's also a technology proof

01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,639
for a totally autonomous no man on the

01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:18,000
loop so this is not

01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:22,239
a rov type vehicle

01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:25,199
and so this is a very interesting

01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:26,719
edge it's a very complex edge and you'll

01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:30,239
see it's also

01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:33,199
hybrid in terms of cloud configuration

01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:34,800
and so i guess you should be interested

01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:38,320
you'll find a lot of video about

01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:40,159
it if you search it's made by a company

01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:43,119
in the uk and in the us called

01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:46,080
submergence in the u.s i'm sub in the uk

01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:47,760
those guys have been doing submarines

01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:50,320
for 20 years

01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:52,000
they know all the technology they know

01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,320
all the robotics

01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,080
and the problem was to remove the man

01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:58,800
from the loop

01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:59,199
and bring the intelligence so it's it

01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,639
was

01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:04,320
even for them quite a change on the fact

01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:05,920
that they were also going to go on the

01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:09,520
surface instead of staying

01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:12,639
on their surface so

01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:16,239
it is not a really easy task to

01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,719
do this because the marine environment

01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:19,119
is

01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:21,280
very highly regulated so some of you may

01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:24,000
be seamen but you know

01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:25,760
imo is the acronym for international

01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,600
maritime organization and the issue

01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,719
correct solas

01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:33,280
to say how you should navigate so

01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:34,159
keep in mind that we have ships on the

01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:37,520
planet since

01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:38,000
uh a lot of years and we're talking you

01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,679
know

01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,119
tens of thousands of years people being

01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:44,320
on some kind of boats

01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:46,480
so a lot of regulations were created

01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:47,840
among among the centuries to define how

01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,440
you navigate

01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,920
and uh you have to make sure that you

01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:53,679
follow those rules it doesn't mean that

01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:55,360
you know everybody follows the rules

01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,400
because the ultimate rule is always you

01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:59,040
know don't

01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:00,320
don't eat anything so we're not talking

01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,560
about a car

01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,840
there's no street but we're talking

01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,719
about a place where

01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:07,199
people may do strength things people may

01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,520
not

01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,320
signal where they are so it's uh it's at

01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:13,360
the same time

01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:17,119
regulated and an interesting uh

01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:20,320
space uh then uh if you have anything

01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:22,719
and you are a no man on loop uh anymore

01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:23,440
a boat in that case you have to be able

01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:25,600
to explain

01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:26,480
totally your decisions so this is

01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,520
actually

01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:31,679
something that is part of the

01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,520
the basic requirement any anything that

01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:36,400
ship does has to be explainable

01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:38,239
from a to z in case the legal authority

01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:41,360
is required

01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:42,960
then it has to be highly secure we're

01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:45,280
talking about one ship

01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,719
but this is a kind of a new kind of ship

01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,920
and there will be many so you don't want

01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:51,119
anybody to hack

01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,840
into the ship take uh you know ownership

01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,840
of it so

01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:56,320
for the mayflower knowing that that ship

01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,280
is going to navigate about at 10 knots

01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:01,119
you know there is highly a big risk if

01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:03,840
somebody uh

01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:04,560
tries to to take it because it's not a

01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,119
dangerous

01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,000
movement but uh if you think into a

01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:10,080
larger ship

01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,520
then you can have a very interesting

01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,840
security issues and they wanted to

01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:16,080
address them from the beginning

01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:17,840
and then you know there was a lot of

01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,239
discussion in the previous presentation

01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:22,080
about

01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:24,000
bandwidth latency etc so

01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,679
it's a challenge to manage and to send

01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,480
mission order to a ship like this it's

01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:29,440
at sea

01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:31,520
it is not always connected it cannot be

01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,360
always connected

01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:35,840
if there is connectivity the bandwidth

01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:39,440
is absolutely miserable

01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:41,600
uh nevertheless the latency

01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:43,600
is okay i mean we're talking about

01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,719
satellite transmission latency most of

01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,800
the time so

01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:48,880
the there is an interesting management

01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,239
issue on such a ship

01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,400
so this is just to give you like you

01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:55,760
know what are the challenges that

01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:57,679
uh were to be addressed on that ship

01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,520
and i think i'm going very really really

01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:02,159
very fast so my

01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,040
let's explain the edge that's your turn

01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:05,760
thank you

01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:08,480
thanks eric hi everyone thank you i went

01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,480
way too fast

01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,159
so like eric was uh explaining you know

01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:13,760
and that's what you know

01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:15,520
etch computing is about right the other

01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:18,480
challenges we have with the

01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:19,199
network latency and the the connections

01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:21,119
right

01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:23,679
dropping in between and between far

01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:26,560
remote locations low bandwidth

01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:26,960
so in this use case where our edge is

01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:28,719
the

01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,719
this autonomous port the main flower

01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:32,880
ship right that's our edge

01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:34,639
and uh and then you can see this is a

01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:36,239
logical diagram and then we'll go into

01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,599
more into the technical depths of how

01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:39,280
this is all working

01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:41,119
but if you look on the left side right

01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:43,440
that's the that's the board

01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:44,320
the mayflower and it has the navigation

01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,920
system

01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,679
many different scientific you know

01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,760
instruments on top of it

01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:51,679
then it has the telecommunication gear

01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,840
so you can talk through the you know

01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:55,520
from the wi-fi when it's close to the

01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,480
port or you can go through the satellite

01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:59,119
network

01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:00,239
or through the mobile you know modem so

01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:01,599
all these different options are

01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:03,599
available

01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:05,199
and you can see the connections going

01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:06,400
back they're sort of the solution we

01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:08,480
said the ibm the

01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:10,000
hybrid cloud option right so in the

01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:13,360
cloud we have the

01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,800
uh solution basically the back ends

01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,840
components running and of course the

01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,000
front end as well

01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:19,199
so the data which is coming over from

01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,639
the board into the

01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:22,320
into the cloud and then we have

01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:23,280
different kinds of micro services

01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:26,400
running on the

01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:27,360
openshift platform to you know normalize

01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:29,119
that data

01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:31,920
do different kinds of analysis on that

01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:34,800
data we have different kinds of feeds

01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:35,520
which can go to you know portal or this

01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,760
uh

01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:39,760
3d visualizations or we have the chat

01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:42,080
board or different scientific teams

01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:44,080
stem purposes school because uh one of

01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:45,599
the purpose of this uh

01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,199
of this mission was to make data

01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:49,199
available uh freely for

01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:51,040
everyone right especially for the stem

01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:54,480
purposes researchers

01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:56,000
uh academia and all that then we have

01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:58,000
further integrations we have

01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,760
integrations with the ais system

01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,840
so we see where the port is we have

01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:04,480
integrations with the with the weather

01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:06,800
api so you know and this all of these

01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:08,800
different informations coming into

01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,920
you know some of being evaluated at the

01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,840
edge and some of

01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:14,320
being evaluated in the the central

01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:16,000
location for further analysis

01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:17,440
then they have this control center as

01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,199
well as shown in the

01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:21,360
in the middle of the picture where all

01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:22,239
the mission management vessel monitoring

01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,480
is happening

01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:25,679
they have a safety care kill switch i

01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:28,320
think that's required

01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,599
by the this is required by the laws and

01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:31,360
then you know different kinds of

01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:34,000
optimizations happening

01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,719
so in a in a nutshell this is like the

01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,159
high level

01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:39,360
uh logical overview and all right let's

01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:42,080
go to the next slide and let's

01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,599
drill into it just just one comment uh i

01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:47,360
forgot to tell you

01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:50,239
earlier but this ship is actually uh

01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:50,800
um had his own homologation so it's a

01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:52,960
real

01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,920
ship not an experimental one it's

01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:57,119
insured

01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,520
by a regular ship insurance so this is

01:51:57,119 --> 01:52:01,040
not

01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:05,040
a a toy okay

01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:05,040
our test it's going to sail for 10 years

01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:09,360
and i think you saw the the video and

01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,880
the pictures in the beginning right so

01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,960
yes and there's plenty of material

01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,840
available on the web on youtube about

01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,599
this

01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,520
okay so let's look at the the solution

01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:20,800
architecture details by the way this

01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:21,119
this uh this framework uh we are going

01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,800
to

01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:25,040
like actually call this like an

01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:27,679
autonomous vessel framework

01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:29,679
so if edge computing framework for the

01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:31,679
autonomous vessels of the future so we

01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:33,840
we are working on that already but let's

01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:36,639
look at look deep into this so

01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:38,000
on the left side is our mayflower ship

01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:41,360
that's the edge

01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,840
and it has a bunch of uh

01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,880
systems running on top of it as some the

01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:48,480
nvidia

01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:50,239
the microprocessors over there and uh

01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:52,080
and it has the kafka that's the

01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:52,800
messaging bus which is used to interact

01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,800
with different

01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,080
uh sensors information coming from

01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,040
different components

01:52:56,080 --> 01:53:01,119
telemetry data and now from there there

01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,080
are multiple paths to forward that

01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,599
information

01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,719
so this is just about the telemetry data

01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:05,679
we're talking about here and then i'll

01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:08,480
go into the edge

01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:10,880
agent as well so you we have uh like

01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:12,719
adding cross benching we have the

01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:15,360
connections through the uh over the

01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:17,199
internet right whenever it's possible

01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:19,119
we have the another pipe through the

01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:20,159
satellite for the ais data for the

01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:21,520
positioning in

01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:23,199
it it also provides the various

01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:25,760
different kinds of metrics

01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:26,560
like the speed and dots and the wind

01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,960
speed and different

01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:30,960
conditions around it and then we have

01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:34,000
another you know weather api

01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:35,760
so we we know based on the uh position

01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,520
which we get from ais what are the

01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:39,840
conditions are forecast

01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:41,599
for the for the journey of the sport so

01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:44,159
all of that information

01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:45,920
comes into the uh ibm cloud which runs

01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:46,960
on openshift platform at the bottom you

01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,360
can see that we have

01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,199
these are all cloud native modern cloud

01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:52,800
native architecture based solution

01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:54,239
so we have a bunch of different micro

01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,960
services which are handling different

01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:56,800
tasks

01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:58,320
so we get all this information whether

01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,840
it's coming through kafka

01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:01,679
messaging into our system into our

01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,400
platform through ais through weather

01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:04,560
channel

01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,760
where all of this information is stored

01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,440
in a mongodb

01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:10,320
another cloud native service in our

01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:12,719
cloud and then we use a serverless mode

01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:14,080
functions to route this data and do

01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:16,880
different things with the data

01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:18,719
so the first thing is we you know as the

01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,960
data will be continuously coming

01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:22,800
we take a dump into the object storage

01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,760
that's for the historical and archive

01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,360
purposes

01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:28,000
and where this is where you know all the

01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:29,119
uh stem universities academia whoever

01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,719
wants to download

01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:32,159
they will be getting information through

01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,560
the object storage

01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:36,000
then we have uh apis available raster

01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,360
apis and as you can see through

01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,679
functions in the middle

01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:41,199
you can have the you can have you can

01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:42,080
you know call our api and get

01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:45,199
information

01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:46,880
in real time or on the historical stuff

01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:49,440
then uh the another interesting thing if

01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,400
you go on our website the mass400.com

01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,679
you will see this

01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:54,800
rt7 leg octopus that's basically the

01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:57,679
digital assistant

01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,280
based on the watson assistant we also

01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:02,239
call it the

01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:03,920
ai captain so you can interact basically

01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,880
in simple word it's a chat board but

01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,400
it's it has

01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,400
a lot of interesting things built in

01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:11,199
into that uh into this

01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:12,960
board so that's another uh venue for the

01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:15,440
users to interact

01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,199
then comes the edge point uh the sorry

01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:20,400
the edge application manager

01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:23,199
that's ibm's and edge endpoint solution

01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:24,719
so basically you know the models like we

01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:26,719
talked about you know there's a lot of

01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:27,760
ai stuff running on the edge which is

01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:29,679
the shift layer

01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:31,360
so if you want to you know update pull

01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,239
the models and if there is any updated

01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:34,239
model built

01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:35,840
in the central location and the board

01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:37,840
needs to pull any update

01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:39,920
that's where the edge agent can pull

01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,960
from the edge application manager

01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,960
whenever there is a

01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:44,480
connectivity available so that's the

01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:47,199
function of the edge manager

01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:47,760
it's watching the board it's sending the

01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:49,840
code

01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:51,599
basically it's a pull from the board to

01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,440
the central location

01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:55,199
then this is running in like typical

01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:56,159
cloud infrastructure where you have the

01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:58,400
uh you know

01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:59,360
firewalls ddos prevention all those

01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:02,400
things

01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:05,280
and last but not least uh we have the

01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:07,440
portal available mass400.com so if you

01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:08,960
go in the portal you will see

01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:10,639
majority of the stuff the data is just

01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,480
flowing through here there's a link

01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:15,199
there cs dashboard and maybe

01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:16,639
eric can show us later so you can click

01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:18,480
on that link and it will have all the

01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:21,119
telemetry all the information there

01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,599
and this is all work in progress as the

01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:24,400
launch

01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:26,080
is in the spring next year so we will be

01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,880
keep on enhancing and adding more

01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,480
context

01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:31,440
into the portal and the type of data we

01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:33,440
are collecting and different kinds of

01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:36,719
collaboration we are doing in terms of

01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:36,719
different scientific projects

01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:45,920
okay next slide right

01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:46,719
all right so decision so of course i

01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,880
mean autonomous

01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:49,760
has to make lots of decisions a lot of

01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,679
you know uh

01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:54,400
visual training has been done under the

01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:56,400
models to detect the objects right

01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:58,320
so the easy ones are you can you can see

01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:00,320
you know you know try to determine

01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:01,440
is this image an ice work or a fishing

01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:03,599
ship different kinds of

01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:05,360
categories of vessels because i believe

01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:06,880
they have different kinds of protocols

01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:08,800
depending upon what kind of marine

01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:11,520
traffic they engage with

01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:12,400
uh then it's always checking you know

01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,719
the direction

01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:16,159
where it's supposed to be and also also

01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:18,000
optimizing the routes

01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:19,840
and the technologies behind you know

01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,320
different kind of like i log cplex which

01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:22,800
is the

01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:24,480
decision optimization frameworks for use

01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:27,040
building models

01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:28,719
uh then we're also optimizing in terms

01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,719
of the resources on the board

01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:32,639
right so you know the batteries the

01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:34,719
solar power so making sure

01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:36,159
that everything is in check and then

01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:38,960
looking based on the

01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:40,639
weather plays a huge role over here so

01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,520
based on the weather we are you know

01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:44,480
constantly optimizing the route so these

01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:46,320
are some of the

01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:47,599
they're of course much more than that

01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,480
but these are just some of the very high

01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:49,920
level

01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:53,840
you know examples of decision making

01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,840
happening at the bot level

01:57:54,239 --> 01:58:00,320
all right so because you know

01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:02,639
there's always a lot of discussion about

01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:04,239
you know okay what's in the edge so

01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:06,960
we thought about showing you what's

01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:10,000
actually inside the edge for doing the

01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:13,040
navigation decision

01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:16,400
so i'm sorry for a bit busy chart but

01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:18,800
it's it's actually highly simplified

01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:19,520
so i will just explain you how this

01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,960
works

01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:25,040
from left to right so

01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,239
essentially you have all the sensors on

01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:27,599
the ship and

01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:29,280
i'm not showing everything i just took

01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:33,360
the big ones the vision

01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:35,119
the radar the local weather and the ais

01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:36,560
there are a bit more sensors on the chip

01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:39,119
like a sonar and

01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:41,360
lidar and infrared but you know they're

01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:44,320
not useful in the explanation so

01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:44,880
essentially you have a block of software

01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:47,599
which is

01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:49,840
uh in charge of making sure all the

01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:52,960
structural data becomes structural so

01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:54,880
the best example is the vision and to

01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:58,320
give you an idea what it means

01:58:54,880 --> 01:59:01,360
they've been collecting c uh

01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:04,239
images from real you know c points

01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:05,520
on boats uh for four years to be able to

01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:07,679
have uh

01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:10,560
the right models those are not the

01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:13,599
models that you will see in a in a car

01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:14,480
the boat is apparently moving animal the

01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:18,000
waves are

01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:20,480
can be very high so you can imagine that

01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,239
there is a bunch of things that are

01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,960
quite special into making sure you can

01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:25,199
recognize

01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:27,119
any kind of floating object so that's

01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:30,400
the first piece

01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:32,480
then once you've done all that you

01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:34,960
you enter something that wasn't on one

01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:36,080
of the charts shown by a friend from

01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,800
china telecom about

01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:40,400
the data fusion but essentially at that

01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:44,159
point you're going to run

01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:47,360
a set of engine rules rules and genes

01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:50,159
to check what you should do based on

01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:52,400
the regulations so what are the rules at

01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:55,760
c allowing to do and you're going to

01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:58,000
have to assess your position you

01:59:55,760 --> 02:00:00,000
versus any object around you so it's a

01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,679
one-to-one set of assessments

02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,599
that are going to give you what are the

02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:05,199
possible choices

02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:06,960
and at that point you have to take into

02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:08,639
account the maps because some of the

02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,679
things you will want to assess are going

02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:11,520
to be

02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:13,920
the position of the cost because you may

02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:15,280
want to avoid eating the coast

02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,040
and once you've done that and you have

02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,920
your set of possibilities actually

02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,360
that's uh

02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,400
that's getting into some interesting

02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:24,960
math because you will have to run

02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:27,280
in the ship so this is again happening

02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:29,360
at the edge

02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:32,239
linear programming programs to actually

02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:35,119
find the optimal route

02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:35,520
based on the weather data and also based

02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:37,760
on

02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:39,360
you versus all the other objects around

02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:42,480
you so

02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:45,840
you probably understand that one

02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:47,599
boat solution is very easy a one two

02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,679
mini solution is an exponentially

02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:51,920
complex problem so you have um

02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:52,880
quite a bit of linear programming

02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:56,480
utilized

02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:58,639
in the in the ship they actually use a

02:00:56,480 --> 02:01:00,080
banking software for doing this and it's

02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:02,560
very efficient

02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:04,080
and once you've done that you can you

02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,639
reach the the right most

02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:07,520
box where you you can compare to your

02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:09,280
mission you know this

02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:11,760
align with your mission and possibly

02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:15,360
with uh you know something new coming in

02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:17,599
that could be like um an sos or a

02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:18,880
request and then you're gonna act and

02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:20,960
you can go on

02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:23,360
you know act on the rudder and act on

02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:25,599
the on the proper speed

02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:27,599
and so that's that's kind of all the

02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:28,560
stack you have in there so again this is

02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:31,199
uh

02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:31,760
this was on the previous uh chart this

02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:35,599
is all

02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:37,599
linux docker containers

02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:39,360
and and when there is a connection you

02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:41,440
may receive a

02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:43,520
new mission information or you may want

02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:46,960
to send

02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:50,000
all your decision taken to the ground

02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:53,119
through the intermittent connection

02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,119
that's typically satellite at sea and uh

02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:56,960
and on the right side which is the you

02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:58,239
know the on-site at the plant

02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,320
this is where all the development is

02:01:58,239 --> 02:02:02,639
made and this is where they can trigger

02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:04,320
updates and based on the data they

02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:04,960
receive from the ship so that gives you

02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:07,119
like

02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:08,080
a very simplified idea on the way the

02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:10,960
system

02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:12,080
works and i'm sure you understand that

02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:14,480
this is not a

02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:16,400
tiny edge it's a pretty complex edge

02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:19,440
even if it's low power because it's a

02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:20,960
solar power chip

02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:23,599
so if you have questions i think you

02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:26,480
know you should post them

02:02:23,599 --> 02:02:27,520
and the thing i wanted to show you after

02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,040
is

02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,880
as you understand it's a it's an

02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:33,360
interesting challenge to test

02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:34,080
a complex solution like this and

02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:37,679
actually

02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:40,320
they have created a game to test it so

02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:41,760
i just took a screenshot of their game

02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:45,280
so this is the boat here

02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:47,280
that you have here this is a

02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:49,040
your problem so that's one eco and you

02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:51,520
have characteristics

02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:52,560
and when you run the the system it's

02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,760
gonna

02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,040
show up in clear language this is what

02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:59,760
the ship should do

02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:00,639
so what you're seeing is actually what

02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:02,719
is required

02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:05,440
to go to the captain log that the ship

02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:08,080
is actually creating as it navigates

02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,599
to explain how the decision is taking so

02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:12,400
it's going to be able to

02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:13,840
to actually you know it is not going to

02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:17,199
be well it is able

02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:19,440
actually today to do this so

02:03:17,199 --> 02:03:20,480
every time he assesses all the

02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:23,520
situations

02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:25,840
based on the inputs and then it will log

02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,599
just like in a captain logbook what it's

02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:28,719
going to do based on the situation so

02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:32,080
you have a

02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:34,480
captain that's very efficient and never

02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,480
sleeps

02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:40,880
so i think we're done for this name tell

02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:43,360
us about what's coming

02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:44,000
yes so uh like i said right i mean this

02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:45,920
is a

02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,760
work in progress and the target is

02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:50,480
spring 2021 for

02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:51,360
the the voice to start so there is lots

02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:54,480
of uh

02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:54,880
testing uh will be happening uh where

02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,280
it's

02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:58,800
located right now in the show over there

02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,679
there's a lot of system integration like

02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,920
you mentioned the

02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:03,360
integration with different uh third

02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,719
parties like you know

02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:06,880
third party what i mean is the other

02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:07,760
outside applications like weather api

02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:10,159
with the ais

02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:11,920
data and connecting different kinds of

02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:13,119
the modem connectivities and the

02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:15,199
cellular networks

02:04:13,119 --> 02:04:16,880
so all of the testing is going to happen

02:04:15,199 --> 02:04:18,960
then also the testing

02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:20,000
between the some of the systems on the

02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,840
board itself

02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,760
so there is you know work in progress

02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:26,400
and then we have

02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,760
we have so many requests for uh science

02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:30,159
experiments that uh

02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:32,159
it's very overwhelming for the team and

02:04:30,159 --> 02:04:35,040
so this so there's uh you know

02:04:32,159 --> 02:04:36,880
because these science projects and the

02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,679
teams they want live information so it's

02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:39,920
not like

02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:41,599
you load up some scientific instrument

02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:42,560
and when it gets to two three weeks

02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:44,639
later from

02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,320
the uk to boston then you get

02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:49,119
information they are saying we want

02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:50,639
the data if possible as much as possible

02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:53,920
live as the boat is

02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:56,880
sailing through the ocean so integration

02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:57,599
of all those experiment systems like one

02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,239
one of the

02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:00,800
experiments is that it's a four node rs

02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:03,360
by

02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:04,239
raspberry pi cluster which wants to do

02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:06,480
something in

02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:07,520
looking at the ocean and they want to

02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:09,440
integrate with the

02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,280
main channels in the system so we can

02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:13,199
get all the information so

02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:15,760
there are a variety of requests coming

02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:19,360
through for these science experiments

02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:20,320
and like um you know eric mentioned this

02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:22,719
is like a

02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:24,480
10-year around the planet doing science

02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:25,920
so there's lots and lots of plans right

02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:29,599
now there's a lot of interest

02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:32,840
from the industry and uh we'll see

02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:34,639
i mean there's a lot of work needs to be

02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:38,719
done

02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:38,719
okay so any questions

02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:43,040
so there was questions i i was looking

02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,800
through the chat so one question was

02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,159
about the data so yes the data will be

02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:47,760
available openly

02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:49,440
there might be few things which are

02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:51,440
sensitive but

02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:54,079
majority of the data will be available

02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:56,320
for for consumption

02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:57,119
the other question was about security so

02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:59,199
security

02:05:57,119 --> 02:06:00,239
like for example the secure connection

02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:02,719
between the

02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:04,400
edge and the edge manager which runs on

02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:06,480
the openshift platform

02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,840
that's done through sign and encrypted

02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:09,360
messages in between and then the

02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:10,000
containers which are going back and

02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:12,239
forth

02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,599
the uh cloud native containers white

02:06:12,239 --> 02:06:15,840
code that is all

02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:17,360
checked by the scanners on the cloud

02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:19,679
before they are pulled

02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:21,599
on the on the side so yeah so it's uh

02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:25,199
using the enterprise level security

02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:25,199
which we use on the ground as well

02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:34,480
brett yeah

02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:35,520
we have another 50 pages to explain you

02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:39,119
the details

02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:39,840
we didn't bring them up it's not very

02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:41,920
nice to be

02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:44,239
so not so interactive but you know

02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:45,920
typically we go to sail by 5 000

02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:46,480
questions when we present the ship so i

02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:48,719
guess

02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:50,159
everybody's shy on the 44 participants

02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:53,280
so

02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:55,679
you know you can get to us later but

02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:57,520
i think it is at the same time a superb

02:06:55,679 --> 02:07:00,320
edge

02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:01,679
very typical or complex hybrid cloud

02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:03,920
implementation

02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:06,159
and it has all the characteristics of

02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:10,079
what's happening now in the industry

02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:12,480
and finally it works so this is

02:07:10,079 --> 02:07:13,920
this is sukdev kapoor i pasted a

02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:16,960
question in the chat

02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:18,560
perhaps got missed so so what happened

02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:20,880
let's say if you're in the middle of the

02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:23,199
ocean somewhere and and there is some

02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:26,000
kind of a failure on the ship

02:07:23,199 --> 02:07:26,400
and and you need to service it uh how do

02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,520
you

02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:33,440
how do you address that uh so we have

02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:36,560
planned to actually train an octopus

02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:40,079
now it's a joke no that that's a good

02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:42,480
plan i'm all

02:07:40,079 --> 02:07:43,520
so there is nobody to service the ship

02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:46,159
like you know

02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:48,000
a human being on the on the ship so

02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:52,079
technically speaking everything is

02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:55,360
uh duplicated three times in that ship

02:07:52,079 --> 02:07:56,960
okay at least two times and most

02:07:55,360 --> 02:08:00,239
everything is three times

02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:03,599
uh and if if something bad would happen

02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:06,159
the ship base system would actually

02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:06,880
try to maintain it in uh in a position

02:08:06,159 --> 02:08:09,440
not to be

02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:11,599
i would say destroyed by the weather and

02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:14,560
then the ship would send

02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:14,880
an emergency message so and it would

02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,079
take

02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:19,440
two weeks to get to the ship minimum

02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:22,480
if it's somewhere in the ocean that's

02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:26,239
kind of the average

02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:29,520
so it is designed to be quite resilient

02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:29,840
by default luckily the guys doing this

02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:32,639
do

02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:34,480
military submarines so they know to make

02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:37,360
stuff that's very solid but

02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:37,840
you know the ocean is very strong so

02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:41,840
there is

02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:44,239
there is a plan for everything is broken

02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:46,079
and it's called for help and uh and

02:08:44,239 --> 02:08:46,560
there is even a plan in case the boat

02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:50,079
gets

02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:51,760
you know upside down there is a system

02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:53,199
to avoid the boats to be destroyed and

02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:55,119
to still call for help

02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:57,360
if the big wave does something bad to

02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:59,040
the boat

02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:00,800
yes so uh the questions i'm looking at

02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:03,599
some two more questions one is around

02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:06,719
the kafka streaming yes so the kafka

02:09:03,599 --> 02:09:07,760
is uh used as a messaging bus on the

02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:09,679
board itself for

02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:11,360
communications between different uh

02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:14,000
components over there

02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:14,960
and uh so we will get all the different

02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,280
kinds of

02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:18,800
let's say operational data on the board

02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:21,280
and we just plug into that

02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:22,320
kafka stream through the through the

02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:24,000
agent container

02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:25,920
and then we pull it back into the cloud

02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:28,159
where we have another listener

02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:30,159
like uh like kafka from there as you

02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:31,920
know in the in the messaging we can

02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:33,440
wipe this out to any streaming masters

02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:35,760
right mqtt

02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:37,599
nats whatever you like we can push it

02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:39,360
there but then we also have the apis

02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:41,280
available

02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:43,360
next question is are there any plans to

02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:46,159
replicate the patterns and learnings on

02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:49,280
other vessels such as cargo ships

02:09:46,159 --> 02:09:53,360
eric uh yeah

02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:56,960
so there are already companies

02:09:53,360 --> 02:10:00,000
that are working with the ship maker to

02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:02,000
get pieces of the

02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,239
intelligent solution on their own

02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,960
equipment

02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:07,920
for sure this is uh not finished and

02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:10,719
they need to

02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:11,599
test it but there is a very strong

02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:14,190
interest

02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:15,360
from many parties so

02:10:14,190 --> 02:10:17,920
[Music]

02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:19,360
yeah the plan is yes there is a plan and

02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:22,560
actually

02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:23,199
i am very sure there will be a set of

02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:25,760
products

02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:27,520
out of the ai captain solution that is

02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:30,560
in the mayflower

02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:32,800
very surely available like starting next

02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:34,719
year

02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:36,400
they're very mature in what they've done

02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:39,599
so yes

02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:40,320
it will go to we are we are talking to

02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:44,480
big big

02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:46,000
ship bankers and to add to that like you

02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:48,239
mentioned about the patterns

02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,520
like i mentioned in the beginning we do

02:10:48,239 --> 02:10:52,560
plan to uh you know

02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:54,800
we're working on this uh sort of like a

02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:56,800
we can call a standard autonomous vessel

02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:57,040
framework which we will publish the you

02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,880
know

02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:00,800
the white paper everything in detail how

02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:02,159
the solution works so we do want to

02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:05,360
create a framework

02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:05,679
for this kind of uh you know autonomous

02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:09,119
uh

02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:11,440
vessels so yeah and i would like to add

02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:12,239
a comment about replication on other

02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:15,100
vessels

02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:16,400
larger ships cargo ships or whatever

02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:17,760
[Music]

02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:19,520
there will be a little bit of applied

02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:22,239
science because

02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:23,119
as you can quickly understand if you

02:11:22,239 --> 02:11:26,560
think about

02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:27,840
just the vision models the location of

02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:30,000
the camera

02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:31,760
is important the type of camera is

02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,199
important

02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:34,880
when you go to a different type of

02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:35,760
vessel you have a different type of

02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:39,360
drift and

02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:41,840
behavior at sea so they will be

02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:42,719
the solution is reusable but there will

02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:45,440
be different

02:11:42,719 --> 02:11:47,119
rule sets and models in the solution

02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:50,320
they will be customized to

02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:52,560
the size of vessels for sure

02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,639
and they're already working on it so for

02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:56,320
example going at sea

02:11:54,639 --> 02:11:58,400
and going in the river it's going to be

02:11:56,320 --> 02:12:06,800
a different piece of cake because

02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:08,960
there is no bridge at sea

02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,840
so there is a question from tony yeah

02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:12,639
this this

02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,239
can be applied to current ships not for

02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:18,719
the autonomy

02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:22,079
i think but for um having a system that

02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:25,280
never sleeps always watch and is able to

02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:26,800
you know permanently survey uh

02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:29,679
what's happening around the ship and

02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:32,000
recommend the best routes

02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:34,079
so i guess this is this is what's going

02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:37,440
to happen to the existing fleet

02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:38,960
and the the the autonomous ships will be

02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:40,000
designed differently from the ships we

02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,679
have today you

02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,760
you have to understand that if you take

02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:45,280
a regular ship there is a lot of space

02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:47,440
taken by the human beings

02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,880
just for the you know being able to stay

02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:50,159
there you need toilets you need rooms

02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:53,679
you need kitchen

02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:55,040
so the the future autonomous ships

02:12:53,679 --> 02:12:57,040
are being designed right now and they

02:12:55,040 --> 02:13:03,840
are going to be radically different

02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:03,840
from what you see on the oceans

02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:10,079
a name you take the question on the open

02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:10,079
source

02:13:10,639 --> 02:13:14,320
what open source software is used in the

02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:17,840
solution so

02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:17,840
let's see

02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:22,480
well the thing is the ibm's uh ibm's

02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:24,800
platform like uh

02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:26,480
open shift and these are already not

02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:27,840
necessarily like open source but very

02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:30,719
open platforms

02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:32,480
and technologies you can see using kafka

02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:34,560
i mean these are all open source

02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,840
solutions available as well so wherever

02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:38,159
it was possible

02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:40,639
we tried to use it but then there is

02:13:38,159 --> 02:13:42,239
also like for example when you are

02:13:40,639 --> 02:13:43,840
when you are integrating with the

02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:46,639
telemetry systems

02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:48,400
that is not very you know they are sort

02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:50,000
of proprietary systems right

02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:52,159
so the most thing is as long as there

02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,119
are you know apis available which we can

02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:55,119
integrate with

02:13:53,119 --> 02:13:57,119
and that also goes for this the question

02:13:55,119 --> 02:14:00,239
which was asked what about the

02:13:57,119 --> 02:14:02,880
older vessels as long as we have the

02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:04,480
api or some sort of you know way to get

02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:07,199
information from their

02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:08,480
from their systems right it should be

02:14:07,199 --> 02:14:10,400
able to do so

02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:12,079
not everything is open source in the

02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:13,440
solution but wherever it was possible we

02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:16,480
applied it here

02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:17,360
and then the the opens to the edge to

02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:20,480
edge piece

02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:23,360
the edge management piece is uh what

02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:24,320
is is similar to the one called the open

02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:25,679
horizon

02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:28,480
so i saw it in the charts in the

02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:30,800
beginning so the edge management

02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:33,520
that we have into the ship as part of

02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:37,040
the openshift cloud packs

02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:41,840
is is made on top of the open horizon

02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:41,840
code base

02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:49,920
i think i see the questions a new

02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:52,800
question in

02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:56,719
the q a window did you apply any ai

02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:56,719
algorithms to implement your project

02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:02,800
well there is a lot i mean i don't know

02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,400
which like uh

02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:06,079
in particular i don't know the details

02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:07,599
of like if there's any particular

02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:10,960
algorithm but there's a lot of ai

02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:10,960
involved as you can imagine

02:15:11,119 --> 02:15:15,520
i don't know often what kind of i can't

02:15:13,119 --> 02:15:17,440
see the q a so i'd like to see it and

02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:20,159
i'm going to stop sharing so maybe i can

02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:20,159
see the q a

02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:24,079
okay i can see it now

02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:36,320
so i'm not sure i'm not sure about the

02:15:34,079 --> 02:15:38,400
question did you apply any ai algorithm

02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:40,320
so this yeah like naim said this is full

02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:43,040
of ai from

02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:44,159
deep learning to machine learning to

02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:47,679
optimization

02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:50,719
systems so the answer is yes

02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:52,480
many at least uh you know i

02:15:50,719 --> 02:16:05,199
i can't give you the number but this is

02:15:52,480 --> 02:16:07,040
a two digit numbers

02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:08,560
all right can you speak about the opener

02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:11,199
sure

02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:13,119
so yeah open her horizon this uh ibm's

02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:13,440
edge application manager this is based

02:16:13,119 --> 02:16:15,679
on

02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:16,480
open horizon basically this was the work

02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:19,280
done i think

02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:20,239
three four years ago in one of our teams

02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:21,760
and this whole

02:16:20,239 --> 02:16:23,760
we just have taken that code still

02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:24,400
available the open horizon is and

02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:27,040
basically

02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:27,760
it's the model of where we have the edge

02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:30,079
application

02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:32,960
manager sitting in the central location

02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:36,080
and we have all these edges

02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:38,960
nodes and the way it works is uh

02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:40,559
it's always doing a pull from the

02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:41,760
central location so for example if

02:16:40,559 --> 02:16:43,280
you're a developer

02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:45,359
you go and build your application

02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:47,519
containerized application and you

02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:48,639
you register those uh applications with

02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:50,160
a central location

02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:52,000
and then the edges are connecting

02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:54,399
there's a policy which you

02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,760
push to these all these edges and in the

02:16:54,399 --> 02:16:57,760
policy you define

02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:59,439
what to pull how when to pull and what

02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:00,960
are the different criterias right

02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:03,760
so whenever your developer goes and

02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:06,000
let's say for example in inferencing

02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,519
so your developer is building uh you

02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:09,599
just update the model

02:17:07,519 --> 02:17:10,559
for better you know for improving the

02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:12,559
accuracy

02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:13,599
the model will get updated the container

02:17:12,559 --> 02:17:16,160
will get updated

02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:17,519
and the agents sitting wherever it is

02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:18,160
sitting it will know that there is an

02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:20,319
update

02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:22,000
to pull from the central location and it

02:17:20,319 --> 02:17:24,000
will pull down that container and start

02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,840
running on the on the system

02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,439
so that's how you know that's how the

02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:28,479
open horizon was work and now we have

02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:30,399
just you know

02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:32,960
added like a front end and it's a little

02:17:30,399 --> 02:17:34,479
bit more things to make it uh compatible

02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:37,519
you know running on these uh

02:17:34,479 --> 02:17:39,040
openshift platforms so it's totally

02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:41,760
fully based on open source code

02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:42,240
open horizon okay there is a question on

02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:45,280
the

02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:48,800
on the on the latency so uh

02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:49,359
the the ship use a satellite link when

02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:52,160
it gets

02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:53,920
it can be connected it's not always okay

02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:57,519
uh the technology they use

02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:59,040
is um iridium so it's a 300 kilobit per

02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:02,080
second

02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:05,120
up and down link now um the

02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:05,120
the latency

02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:09,359
is not really a problem because i'm not

02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:12,479
sure i was clear enough but

02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:15,760
all the ai is running inside the ship

02:18:12,479 --> 02:18:17,439
so there is no like you call the cloud

02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:19,760
and something happens in the cloud

02:18:17,439 --> 02:18:21,439
the inference the rule systems the

02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:23,679
optimization system this is all running

02:18:21,439 --> 02:18:25,439
in the ship

02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:26,719
so it's on prem inside the ship

02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:30,319
navigating

02:18:26,719 --> 02:18:33,599
and the link is just used to provide

02:18:30,319 --> 02:18:37,519
you know some information about the

02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:40,639
ship situation and get mission updates

02:18:37,519 --> 02:18:41,679
and when you get close to c like close

02:18:40,639 --> 02:18:44,160
to the coast

02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:45,840
and you can get a 4g or maybe one day a

02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:49,120
5g or wi-fi

02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:50,639
then you have a much larger bandwidth

02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:52,479
and at that point actually the bandwidth

02:18:50,639 --> 02:18:55,120
will be dedicated on transferring the

02:18:52,479 --> 02:18:55,760
scientific data because they will want

02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:58,319
to upload

02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:59,250
you know like sounds they have been

02:18:58,319 --> 02:19:00,719
recording and

02:18:59,250 --> 02:19:03,599
[Music]

02:19:00,719 --> 02:19:05,359
on they are going to record sounds and

02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:08,479
try to identify whales

02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:11,840
by the sounds so during the ship

02:19:08,479 --> 02:19:14,240
i'm sorry for this during the ship

02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,040
navigation there is there will be

02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:17,820
inference

02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:19,280
done on the sounds so that the

02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:22,160
[Music]

02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:23,840
the ship will only send pictures and

02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:25,599
information about what kind of where so

02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:27,200
many wealth and where

02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:28,960
and but they will keep recording

02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,880
everything and then they will

02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:32,399
when they are getting too close to coast

02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:35,120
they will just download

02:19:32,399 --> 02:19:36,960
all the data and they will use this for

02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:40,639
the scientist to improve the models

02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:40,639
for detection of the works for example

02:19:42,559 --> 02:19:46,000
and you know i think it's a we could

02:19:44,639 --> 02:19:48,319
spend an hour on

02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,080
just the current 12 experiments on board

02:19:48,319 --> 02:19:53,200
to explain them to you but

02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:55,280
they are also using ai

02:19:53,200 --> 02:20:02,720
and they are also like a big edge for

02:19:55,280 --> 02:20:06,479
the signs in the ship

02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:09,600
uh so this is a very good question

02:20:06,479 --> 02:20:16,000
about computing power

02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:18,640
we do not reveal those information

02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:20,640
but it works very well that's that's my

02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:25,439
assessment i was inside the ship

02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:31,840
a few days ago it's kind of

02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:31,840
pretty nice stuff

02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:37,120
brett i don't know if we have passed the

02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:40,160
time you know sorry yeah

02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:42,800
we can speak for five hours

02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:45,040
no great job and great questions i

02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:48,080
definitely appreciate both eric and name

02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:49,000
so yeah oh you can i recommend you go to

02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:51,920
the

02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:54,160
mis400.com website

02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,120
uh it's it's going to be you know when

02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:57,200
the ship is going to do

02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:58,880
the first c test it's going to be live

02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:00,479
also because all the edge system will be

02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:02,080
activated

02:21:00,479 --> 02:21:04,479
and it's going to be fun to watch what's

02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:06,560
happening uh when the ship will be

02:21:04,479 --> 02:21:08,000
coastal zones they're going to stream

02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:10,720
pictures and video and

02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:13,840
i guess so expect some improvements on

02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:16,160
the website with more data

02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:18,560
and you can come see it in plymouth in

02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:21,600
the uk

02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:23,600
it's it's at the turn chapel

02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:27,840
location if you want to look up on the

02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:27,840
google google map

02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:36,960
okay okay perfect thank you

02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:38,880
for all the time thank you very much for

02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:41,600
the company yes yep

02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:45,600
thanks all and aaron if you don't mind

02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:45,600
uh re-sharing the master presentation

02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:57,280
i think we're on the uh the mayflower

02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:59,840
ship video so we can move back over to

02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:59,840
powerpoint

02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:12,319
perfect and up next advance

02:22:10,319 --> 02:22:14,479
we have a panel meeting at the edge

02:22:12,319 --> 02:22:17,120
cross community collaboration

02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:18,720
to define telecom edge reference

02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:22,080
architectures

02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:24,960
featuring ahmad from saudi telecom

02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:25,840
beth from verizon and cirque de with

02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:29,280
juniper

02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:30,640
i think we have a if we can move one

02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:34,000
slide we got a

02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:36,800
presentation so welcome everybody

02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:39,280
to the meeting at the edge panel which

02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:43,280
is a discussion about cross community

02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:46,479
collaboration across the telecom edge

02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:48,399
so lf edge is is

02:22:46,479 --> 02:22:50,319
obviously has a larger charter than the

02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:52,560
telecom but the

02:22:50,319 --> 02:22:53,520
three of us on this panel are involved

02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:56,000
all in

02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:56,880
telecom type activities and how they

02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:00,160
affect

02:22:56,880 --> 02:23:04,399
uh how they are affecting the edge so

02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:07,200
i introduce myself first beth cohen and

02:23:04,399 --> 02:23:08,240
i work with verizon and was one of the

02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,680
uh we came out

02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:12,240
three and a half years ago with one of

02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:14,319
the first edge

02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:16,000
products virtual network services of

02:23:14,319 --> 02:23:16,960
course we didn't call it edge at the

02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:20,000
time because

02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:21,920
we didn't know that that's uh

02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,840
that wasn't the name for anything at the

02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:27,760
time um

02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:28,720
so uh we're but i've been involved in

02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:31,760
this uh

02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:35,760
cntt which stands for cloud

02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:37,120
infrastructure telecom task force

02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:39,600
or i think that's what it stands for

02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:41,920
today and with that i'd like to

02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:43,439
introduce ahmed and if you could talk a

02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:46,640
little bit more about you know

02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:48,479
what's going on with cntt and you know

02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:50,720
how you're involved and and how it's

02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:52,960
involved with edge

02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:54,800
great thanks beth for your introduction

02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:57,680
i'm ahmed salwaf i'm

02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:58,880
working for scc a cloud under center

02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:02,720
senior advisor

02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:06,240
in terms of age i'm ctt work stream

02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:07,120
edge lead and for telco edgy cloud under

02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:09,840
jsme i'm

02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:10,640
a co-chair in terms of entity as you

02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:12,560
mentioned beth

02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:14,240
it stands for cloud infrastructure

02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:17,040
telecom task force uh

02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:19,280
insanity we tried to to achieve a common

02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:22,240
infrastructure from from its name

02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:23,840
and this common common infrastructure

02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:26,800
should be exposed

02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:27,840
by any workload and can be consumed from

02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:30,399
this work

02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:31,520
from this workload towards the

02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:34,720
infrastructure

02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:35,920
especially in the age we are we are

02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:39,200
trying to achieve

02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:41,280
uh well i will try to put it in this way

02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:43,760
why we have cnt edge

02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:45,280
initially we think about that there is

02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:47,600
no

02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:49,200
common infrastructure at the age that

02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:52,479
can fulfill

02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:56,080
age requirements in terms of

02:24:52,479 --> 02:24:56,640
for example accelerations or cdn use

02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:58,800
cases

02:24:56,640 --> 02:25:00,240
so that's why we bring off bringing

02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:02,160
these ideas that we need to have the

02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:04,720
common infrastructure as the age

02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:06,560
to start to fulfill 80 requirements as

02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:10,160
you know that age become

02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:14,640
mandated to have 5g

02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:17,680
in place just in nutshell and

02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:18,640
you can have a section as well and sit

02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,880
down i

02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:23,120
i think you have a different perspective

02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:26,319
as a coming from a vendor

02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:28,319
like to hear your opinion yeah so uh uh

02:25:26,319 --> 02:25:29,760
first of all my introduction i'm saddev

02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:31,680
kapoor i work for

02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:34,080
juniper networks i'm a distinguished

02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:36,000
engineer i am

02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:38,319
on the technical studying committee for

02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:41,520
ocarina of edge stack

02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:43,439
i was on the technical advisory council

02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:47,359
of lf edge as well

02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:50,880
and and i've been very active

02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:53,680
participant in cntt more specifically

02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:54,720
in in their reference model reference

02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:58,160
architecture

02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:58,880
as well as in the edge work group along

02:25:58,160 --> 02:26:03,040
with beth

02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:05,280
and ahmad in terms of cntt

02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:06,319
one thing which i see is this this this

02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:09,040
one body

02:26:06,319 --> 02:26:10,000
is very telco driven it's a it's a it's

02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:12,479
being driven by

02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,720
telcos with uh with the telco

02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:17,280
requirements and the one thing

02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:18,080
uh where i see is all telcos actually

02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:21,200
green

02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:22,160
to something common to build a common

02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:25,760
platform

02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:29,920
and and and build a conformance program

02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:33,280
uh which they would expect all vendors

02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:37,040
for both nfv as well as a vnfi

02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:39,439
to to to conform to

02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:40,640
which they hopefully are they're

02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:43,680
planning on

02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:46,960
making it as mandatory as as a

02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:50,399
as an rfps and rfis so

02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:52,800
so having said that uh with this uh

02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:55,120
with this reference model and reference

02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:58,720
architecture which is laid out by

02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:59,359
by cntt it actually helps the vendor

02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:02,880
community

02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:05,040
as well in addition to telcos of course

02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:07,200
for the telcos it makes the onboarding

02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:10,319
of their virtual network functions

02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:13,280
a lot easier and simpler uh

02:27:10,319 --> 02:27:15,040
but at the same time for the vendors to

02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:16,479
when when the vendor multiple vendors

02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:19,280
are working

02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:19,600
against the same reference architecture

02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:23,280
and

02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:26,160
working is the same conformance program

02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:26,960
it becomes a lot easier it becomes a lot

02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:30,160
more

02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:32,880
multi-vendor compatibility solutions so

02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:34,160
so i think it's a both win for both

02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:36,640
telcos as well as

02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:37,840
for the vendors that's the way i see it

02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:40,240
yeah i know i agree

02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:41,439
yeah i mean because uh i know you know

02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:43,280
vendors always want to

02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:44,640
do something proprietary you know secret

02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:46,399
sauce and all that but

02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:48,880
you know you have to if you have to

02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:51,359
build something for every single telecom

02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:52,399
um you know that just ramps up your

02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:55,439
costs incredibly

02:27:52,399 --> 02:27:56,560
so i can see the real value for not only

02:27:55,439 --> 02:27:58,479
the vendors but

02:27:56,560 --> 02:28:01,359
you know uh yeah the real value

02:27:58,479 --> 02:28:03,359
obviously is obvious to the telecoms but

02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:04,399
correct there's there's good value with

02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:07,920
the vendor and

02:28:04,399 --> 02:28:11,120
if i may add in terms of the overall uh

02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:12,399
uh the structure of the cnpt body it's

02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:15,600
divided into four

02:28:12,399 --> 02:28:16,080
different logical components uh there is

02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:18,960
a

02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:20,720
reference model which defines at an

02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:23,760
abstract level

02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:27,120
the the reference model for for the

02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:30,240
infrastructure and

02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:30,720
and then from that abstraction model we

02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:32,160
drive

02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:34,160
towards the actual reference

02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:37,760
architecture which is an ra

02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:38,240
and there are two ras ra1 and ra2 r1

02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:41,840
being

02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:44,880
the openstack based and ra2

02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:47,280
is a cloud native and then for

02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:48,080
containerized let's not get into that

02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:51,359
container

02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:53,840
sorry containerized and then then

02:28:51,359 --> 02:28:55,040
those map into reference implementations

02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:58,240
ris

02:28:55,040 --> 02:29:00,960
ri1 and ri2 and then those map

02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:02,319
into reference conformance or compliance

02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:06,240
whatever you know it

02:29:02,319 --> 02:29:08,560
just keeps changing so uh rc1 and rc2

02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:10,319
so that's how it is uh organized and

02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:13,359
then like what ahmad mentioned

02:29:10,319 --> 02:29:14,000
uh earlier that we recognized very

02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:17,359
quickly

02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,560
that does this architecture meet all the

02:29:17,359 --> 02:29:20,960
edge use cases

02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:21,840
and requirement and that's where ahmad

02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:24,479
started

02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:26,240
spearheading uh this new work group

02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:29,359
which is a

02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:31,200
cnpd edge work group and so let's

02:29:29,359 --> 02:29:32,720
let's hear from ahmed to talk a little

02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:33,120
bit more about the edge working group

02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:36,000
since

02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:39,280
i i know i'm co-chair with it but yes

02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,280
you're doing the heavy lifting

02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:45,680
thanks again uh cnt edu work stream we

02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:48,560
initiated from

02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:50,479
six months back i think so as the target

02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:53,680
as i mentioned of cnth

02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:55,120
to start to bring and to avoid the

02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:57,760
fragmentation across

02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:58,399
all communities uh that were working in

02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:01,520
age

02:29:58,399 --> 02:30:04,800
like openstack aids like lfh

02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:05,520
which which has six or seven uh project

02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:07,439
right now

02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:09,120
so the target as i mentioned to bring

02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:10,720
all this project in one place

02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:12,479
and they try to fulfill desire

02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:15,200
requirements from

02:30:12,479 --> 02:30:16,000
from telco perspective we are focused on

02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:19,280
telco

02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:22,399
use cases which is as again which is

02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:24,640
uh required for 5g like ultima

02:30:22,399 --> 02:30:25,600
latency like enhancement mobile

02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:29,040
broadband

02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:31,520
and the massive iot massive

02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:32,319
communication so the target itself to

02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:35,520
fulfill

02:30:32,319 --> 02:30:39,200
the telco use cases and

02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:42,319
to have a cloud infrastructure

02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:47,120
at the age which is more agnostic

02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:50,880
to onboard any cnf or vnf

02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:54,160
above this cloud infrastructure

02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:56,399
that's great uh and i'll i'll add that

02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:57,920
you know my perspective from verizon

02:30:56,399 --> 02:31:00,000
which is that you know the edge is

02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:03,600
extremely important to us for

02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:05,280
for 5g and mac and and

02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:06,640
a whole bunch of other other

02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:09,840
applications that are

02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:11,280
that are out there so we see that as is

02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:14,479
really the future

02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:17,760
um so getting back to soup dev

02:31:14,479 --> 02:31:20,080
um so you're on the akraino team the

02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:21,600
technical committee and also quite

02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:23,760
involved with lfedge

02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:25,439
you know so how does that this tie in to

02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:29,439
the cmtt

02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:30,319
um and i should add uh opnfv and cntt

02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:33,120
meld

02:31:30,319 --> 02:31:33,520
uh the the new future organization uh

02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:37,359
how

02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:37,840
how does that align so uh so akraino is

02:31:37,359 --> 02:31:41,280
very

02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:43,920
uh blueprint driven blueprint

02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:45,120
think of it as a as recipes or or

02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:48,240
vertical

02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:50,800
stacks taking a given use case

02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:51,840
and and building a completely deployable

02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:55,280
tested

02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:59,120
uh sort of a stack

02:31:55,280 --> 02:32:01,520
or a solution right and and there are

02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:02,399
many many uh blueprints which are

02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:06,000
available

02:32:02,399 --> 02:32:06,399
uh some of them uh map into the telco

02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,240
world

02:32:06,399 --> 02:32:10,880
some of them are into the enterprise

02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:13,840
world so essentially a wide

02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:14,240
variety of blueprints and and there are

02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:17,359
some

02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:20,560
blueprints which are very relevant to

02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:22,640
what we are doing in cntp edge or or or

02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:24,000
even in a cnb data reference

02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:26,399
architecture so they

02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,359
they really really are addressing so

02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:31,200
there are two

02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:34,240
the way i see the akraino and cnpt

02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:37,920
uh sort of bridge or or or

02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:39,600
interaction is that we take a look at

02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:40,800
the blueprints which are in the cranial

02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:44,160
community

02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:47,200
and and see uh how they're architected

02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:48,560
and and then then look back to cnp

02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:51,760
architecture and see

02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:54,720
whether they map right so that way

02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:55,120
we are taking essentially a feedback

02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:58,319
from

02:32:55,120 --> 02:33:00,160
one working uh blueprint

02:32:58,319 --> 02:33:02,240
into a reference architecture which is

02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:05,359
being developed so that's one way

02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:08,479
the other way is that since

02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:11,120
telcos are going to essentially

02:33:08,479 --> 02:33:11,600
enforce this reference architecture or

02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:14,080
see

02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:14,800
what is defined by cntt so we want to

02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:16,479
make sure

02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:18,800
that these blueprints which are coming

02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:19,680
in a crano they are conforming to that

02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:21,920
architecture

02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:23,200
you know and therefore it works both

02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:26,800
ways so

02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:29,439
so so this is how i see uh

02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:30,479
both communities the akraina community

02:33:29,439 --> 02:33:34,240
as well as

02:33:30,479 --> 02:33:36,800
the cnpt edu group working together

02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:37,439
to build the bridge to to identify the

02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:39,920
gaps

02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:41,200
and address them so that's what i think

02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:43,120
that's excellent

02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:44,640
and i should add also there's other

02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:45,920
communities that we're working with

02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:49,120
including um

02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:50,080
math and and openstack foundation as

02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:52,960
well so

02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:55,520
these are all important uh inputs into

02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:58,479
the edge

02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:59,040
architectures and the edge standards

02:33:58,479 --> 02:34:01,280
because as

02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:02,720
i have discovered you know working at

02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:06,240
the edge for the last

02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:09,040
four years is the edge is a superset of

02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:10,720
the cloud in that it's more difficult

02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:14,000
because there's

02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:15,600
more of them and and the tools

02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,920
and they're not necessarily all in a

02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:20,240
data center you know nice and neat

02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:22,720
uh so there's a whole lot of work needed

02:34:20,240 --> 02:34:26,080
around orchestration automation

02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:28,160
um and managing um you know

02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:29,520
thousands you know potentially thousands

02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:32,560
of locations

02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:35,439
um with both network

02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:35,920
and resource constraints so that just

02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:39,280
adds

02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:40,000
complexity to to the problem so i'd like

02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:43,200
to

02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:44,319
finish up with the last question so what

02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:46,960
do you see as the

02:34:44,319 --> 02:34:48,720
the biggest technical challenges um to

02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:51,840
defining the edge for

02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:53,280
telco workloads and and i'll ask you

02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:55,439
first took deb and then

02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:57,520
now ahmed i'll talk a little ask you a

02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:58,080
little bit more about the 5g workloads

02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:00,720
and

02:34:58,080 --> 02:35:02,160
and some of the other specific to telco

02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:07,359
type workloads

02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:07,359
yeah so i see i see much more talented

02:35:08,319 --> 02:35:12,640
of course with the disaggregation of

02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:16,080
hardware and software

02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:19,200
uh within within 5g world right

02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:20,000
the edges are becoming lot and a lot

02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:24,720
more

02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:26,800
predominant and and and more and more

02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:28,240
compute resources and more and more

02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:31,439
intelligence is moving

02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:33,120
towards the edge in order to meet the

02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:35,280
latency requirements

02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:36,560
and high bandwidth requirements and so

02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:39,920
forth right

02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:40,800
so so that presents a lot of challenges

02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:45,120
in terms of

02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:48,720
the the telco specific edge use cases

02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:52,240
right and now

02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:54,560
with this this disaggregation effort

02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:55,520
like all these different functions for

02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:58,720
example uh

02:35:55,520 --> 02:36:01,280
5g core upf function amf smf

02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:02,960
they could be living at different places

02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:04,720
not so it's kind of

02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:06,319
even though there are edges but the

02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:07,280
distinction is getting kind of little

02:36:06,319 --> 02:36:09,040
bit fuzzy

02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:11,359
some of these functions could be in the

02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:13,600
core data centers some of them could be

02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:15,040
on the far edge some some could be in

02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:17,439
the uh

02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:18,399
in the pops in the original centers and

02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:22,160
whatnot

02:36:18,399 --> 02:36:24,720
right so so so that presents challenge

02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:25,600
and and in terms of how do you carve out

02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:28,160
end-to-end

02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:29,200
network slicing so like if you take if

02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:32,399
you want to take

02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:35,120
a telco cloud for instance right

02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:36,160
and you have a multiple tenants multiple

02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:39,439
mnos

02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:42,319
uh you're you're catering to and and

02:36:39,439 --> 02:36:43,680
in order to carve out end-to-end all the

02:36:42,319 --> 02:36:46,880
way from the radio

02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:48,319
to on the back end or the internet or to

02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:50,800
the core data center

02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:52,240
you know how do you carve out the slices

02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:54,640
how do you carve out

02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:55,680
that so that you can ensure uh quality

02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:58,720
of service or

02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:00,800
or or your slas and so forth

02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:01,760
well those standards haven't even been

02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:04,479
set yet though

02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:05,600
correct so so those are those are i mean

02:37:04,479 --> 02:37:08,160
these are the challenges

02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:09,040
you know which i'm uh i'm i'm sort of

02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:11,120
seeing

02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:12,160
that we have to we as a body have to

02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:14,720
solve it

02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:15,600
and and and we have to understand them

02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:17,520
and and

02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:19,200
and the whole end to end orchestration

02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:22,240
and so forth so those are

02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:23,280
to me uh going to be the real serious

02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:25,680
challenges

02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:27,600
and and managing the edges and and

02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:29,120
securing them that's a that's another

02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:32,240
big challenge i see

02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:35,439
right so with these thousands of

02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:37,920
edges which which you're deploying

02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:39,840
you you you can't afford to be sending

02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:43,200
drivers in a pickup truck

02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:46,560
and going and serving or or or rebooting

02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:47,280
the compute machines on these far remote

02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:50,560
sites

02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:53,680
so you automation so so yeah and

02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:56,080
securing you know so so ahmed if

02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:58,479
you know as again from the perspective

02:37:56,080 --> 02:38:03,040
of the actual telco operator

02:37:58,479 --> 02:38:06,080
has to deal with these in real life yeah

02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:06,479
yeah i put it in in two way it weighs

02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:10,240
our

02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:14,399
point here first of all the the most of

02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:18,160
age challenges the missing of use cases

02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:21,359
a lot of telecast right now avoid

02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:23,520
to make investment to have distributed

02:38:21,359 --> 02:38:26,800
agent center across their

02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:29,840
nation or their country without valid

02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:33,040
use cases and business cases that can

02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:35,600
have solid roi um to achieve

02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:36,240
to achieve this investment in terms of

02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:38,880
technical

02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:40,399
challenge from my point of view the life

02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:43,600
cycle management of

02:38:40,399 --> 02:38:47,040
of of the age is one the one of the most

02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:47,520
uh technical chances that that operator

02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:50,000
can

02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:51,439
can have it right now and that's why in

02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:54,840
scientific we try

02:38:51,439 --> 02:38:57,200
to to have some reference

02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:58,160
architecture uh and options that can

02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:00,880
facilitate

02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:01,600
the from from operator side to pick and

02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:04,319
choose

02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:05,600
one of this architecture like if we're

02:39:04,319 --> 02:39:08,319
looking for openstack

02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:09,280
we can have distributed compute node or

02:39:08,319 --> 02:39:11,600
controllers

02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:13,120
or centralized controllers all in one

02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:14,720
and we have a lot of options that we

02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:16,479
discuss in tth

02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:18,880
as well as if we're looking for a

02:39:16,479 --> 02:39:21,680
container infrastructure or cooperatives

02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:23,840
we can have the same uh same

02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:25,200
architecture distributed or centralized

02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:27,760
or all-in-one

02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:29,760
uh to make sure that we we hide the

02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:33,359
complexity of infrastructure

02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:36,560
with uh to 5g workloads and make it just

02:39:33,359 --> 02:39:39,920
simple as as much as we can to make

02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:42,560
to make it simple to the to the world

02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:43,840
to be onboarded seamlessly on the cloud

02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:47,040
infrastructure

02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:49,280
yeah thank you so with that um i believe

02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:49,680
our time is up thank you everybody for

02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,520
this

02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:53,760
uh enlightening panel and i know there

02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:55,600
will be an opportunity to

02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:56,800
for the community to get involved i

02:39:55,600 --> 02:40:00,160
encourage everybody

02:39:56,800 --> 02:40:03,680
to do that um and with that um

02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:08,240
our recording is over thank you

02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:08,240
thank i think you're you recording

02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:18,319
all right perfect and

02:40:16,880 --> 02:40:20,960
let's see aaron if you don't mind

02:40:18,319 --> 02:40:24,560
flipping down so we have our

02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:24,560
speaker names up and live

02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:28,640
and we do have uh all three speakers on

02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:31,120
the line now

02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:34,800
so folks please do continue to add your

02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:37,439
questions to the q a window

02:40:34,800 --> 02:40:39,680
yeah yeah we've um can i comment on one

02:40:37,439 --> 02:40:44,000
of the questions that jonathan

02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:45,680
uh goal gave um i'm i would like to

02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,840
have a better understanding of what the

02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:50,800
question was it's it's not 100

02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:51,760
connected to to the edge so i'm trying

02:40:50,800 --> 02:40:55,120
to understand

02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:58,720
uh where where it's coming from um

02:40:55,120 --> 02:41:01,920
you know obviously uh a network

02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:03,840
uh you know the network is kind of the

02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:07,040
ultimate or the original edge

02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:08,240
right because you're always right from

02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:11,359
the beginning you have

02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:13,120
edge and um but but

02:41:11,359 --> 02:41:15,359
you know as the ip networks were

02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:17,120
originally thought of they were really

02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:18,880
not thought of as

02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:21,040
hub and spoke they were really thought

02:41:18,880 --> 02:41:24,240
more of along the line of

02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:26,479
a mesh uh so um

02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:27,920
you know as as applications move into

02:41:26,479 --> 02:41:31,120
the cloud i think the

02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:34,080
networks um have become more

02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:36,240
hub and spoke in terms of how the

02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:39,600
network traffic moves through them

02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:41,520
uh although um and and even actually now

02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:44,720
that everybody's working from home

02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:46,240
uh that's actually become even more so

02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:48,880
that it's hub and spoke because

02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:51,359
everybody's working from the house

02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:53,359
and then they're accessing the the data

02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:56,640
centers or the cloud or whatever

02:41:53,359 --> 02:41:59,920
to to pull down their applications to to

02:41:56,640 --> 02:42:02,800
uh to work so um i don't know

02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:04,319
if uh sick dev and um would have any

02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:07,120
other thoughts about that

02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:08,000
no i think i think you got it right uh

02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:11,359
you know

02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:13,600
that does make sense

02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:16,479
but i i didn't understand what is the dq

02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:19,279
switching uh what kanathan posted

02:42:16,479 --> 02:42:20,640
we offer dq switching as a standard to

02:42:19,279 --> 02:42:24,160
solve the topic of this i

02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:24,160
i don't understand what is dq

02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:30,640
so yeah jonathan says you

02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:32,880
that's why i want to wake up all the

02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:35,040
copper to the home

02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:37,359
so it's kind of like a universal mac

02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:37,359
okay

02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:42,319
well i don't know we're getting rid of

02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:42,640
the copper i don't know about i don't

02:42:42,319 --> 02:42:44,479
know

02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:48,000
about everybody else but we're pulling

02:42:44,479 --> 02:42:48,000
copper out as fast as we can

02:42:48,319 --> 02:42:52,560
so it's moving more toward fire fiber

02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:56,240
and wireless

02:42:52,560 --> 02:42:58,000
so um you know what

02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:59,520
a lot of people haven't been talking

02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,359
about but it's kind of been happening

02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:04,240
under the under the radar

02:43:01,359 --> 02:43:04,640
of course is another application for 5g

02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:08,240
is

02:43:04,640 --> 02:43:08,640
is fixed 5g which kind of solves the

02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:11,920
last

02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:14,560
mile problem uh because the the

02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:16,560
infrastructure to support 5g out to or

02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:17,279
the infrastructure to support that last

02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:19,680
mile

02:43:17,279 --> 02:43:21,120
is a lot cheaper with 5g than it is when

02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:23,359
you have to run

02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:26,720
copper or fiber or whatever out out to

02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:26,720
each individual location

02:43:30,479 --> 02:43:35,760
correct and i think even from the radio

02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:39,279
to the

02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:43,600
to the du is also being replaced

02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:46,240
uh replaced uh uh not with

02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:46,800
i mean being taken away from copper it's

02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:50,080
all fat

02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:54,160
fiber yeah it is all fiber now one g

02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:57,520
yeah yeah yeah one g

02:43:54,160 --> 02:44:01,279
is that's pretty typical correct

02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:02,840
yeah yeah

02:44:01,279 --> 02:44:07,040
um that and that's one of the other

02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:09,760
comments uh that's that the at home

02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:11,279
and we're getting customers asking for

02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:14,560
um

02:44:11,279 --> 02:44:16,399
uh to their campuses you know higher

02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:19,840
than 1g we're we're seeing

02:44:16,399 --> 02:44:19,840
requests for 10g

02:44:22,399 --> 02:44:28,319
but 1g is pretty typical for home

02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:29,840
although the us is kind of behind

02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:32,960
everything everybody else

02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:35,040
in that regard yeah that one g is only

02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:37,600
between the radio and the du

02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:38,160
after that it's all high bandwidth right

02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:40,160
that's right

02:44:38,160 --> 02:44:42,240
it's all fiber too yeah that's that's

02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:45,200
where it is getting aggregated so once

02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:50,160
it hits the du after that it is like

02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:50,160
g and and higher you know right

02:44:52,880 --> 02:45:00,800
another question oh i see

02:44:56,800 --> 02:45:03,120
for i oh this is for iot

02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:04,560
yeah actually if we can read it let's

02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:05,920
we'll read it out loud just because

02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:08,240
i think it just went to the panelists

02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:11,359
but for those on the line the question

02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:14,080
was for the iot a dq uh

02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:14,800
replaces aloha collision detection

02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:18,640
improving

02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:18,640
packet efficiency to near perfect

02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:24,080
let's say i think there's another

02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:27,040
comment

02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:27,760
it does the same at the lower mac on

02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:29,600
synchronous

02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:31,040
networks 2 originally invested for cable

02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:34,080
tv

02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:38,080
ah so it's kind of like a an

02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:38,080
older style network slicing

02:45:39,520 --> 02:45:45,760
yeah i don't know much about it so

02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:46,479
uh i don't know sick damn or aromath do

02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:49,200
you have

02:45:46,479 --> 02:45:50,080
any knowledge of that no no that's not

02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:52,319
my cup of tea

02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:52,319
sorry

02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:59,520
uh let me read the next question are the

02:45:57,520 --> 02:46:00,479
telcos trying to recover some workloads

02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:03,520
from the cloud

02:46:00,479 --> 02:46:07,439
providers in that movement

02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:07,760
um yeah i i'm definitely seeing some of

02:46:07,439 --> 02:46:11,840
that

02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:14,319
going on too

02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:15,439
moving moving out of the cloud providers

02:46:14,319 --> 02:46:17,200
i mean remember that

02:46:15,439 --> 02:46:18,479
the telcos have significant

02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:22,720
infrastructure

02:46:18,479 --> 02:46:26,160
um invested in

02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:29,279
in various cloud things so so

02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:34,000
you know one of the purposes of cntt

02:46:29,279 --> 02:46:37,359
is um is we identified a gap

02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:39,680
in the open source work around

02:46:37,359 --> 02:46:41,359
virtualized workloads right so everybody

02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:45,200
wants virtualized workloads

02:46:41,359 --> 02:46:47,279
and and you know we we've made well

02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:48,560
for the most part we've made the jump to

02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:51,680
vms

02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:52,640
um but the next the next step of course

02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:54,319
is to

02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:56,560
for the virtual the containerized

02:46:54,319 --> 02:46:57,279
workloads and as we talked about in the

02:46:56,560 --> 02:47:01,200
panel

02:46:57,279 --> 02:47:04,399
the containerized workloads um

02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:07,920
uh there's still gaps in the in this

02:47:04,399 --> 02:47:08,720
in the uh tools and the ability to do

02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:12,479
that and

02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:15,200
and a whole lot of the um the workloads

02:47:12,479 --> 02:47:17,359
just haven't been containerized yet um

02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:21,200
and there and there's some

02:47:17,359 --> 02:47:22,240
uh challenges to to containerizing some

02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:24,319
of them

02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:25,439
uh there's some security challenges

02:47:24,319 --> 02:47:28,720
there's um

02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:31,760
you know just the basics on the

02:47:28,720 --> 02:47:34,399
capability of the containerized tools uh

02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:35,040
to support network workloads that you

02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:38,560
know

02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:39,840
it'll get solved over time but it's

02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:41,680
you know right now we're in the

02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:43,840
beginnings so

02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:45,279
yeah we're anxiously looking to

02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:49,279
containerize and

02:47:45,279 --> 02:47:52,160
and move the our network workloads uh

02:47:49,279 --> 02:47:55,040
for a lot of reasons but it's just not

02:47:52,160 --> 02:47:56,800
happening as fast as we'd like

02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:58,080
for the for the containerized workloads

02:47:56,800 --> 02:48:00,160
the basic under

02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:02,720
underneath infrastructure is all

02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:04,880
kubernetes based and

02:48:02,720 --> 02:48:06,319
and there are some challenges and issues

02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:08,319
in terms of security

02:48:06,319 --> 02:48:10,560
as well as multi-tenancy because

02:48:08,319 --> 02:48:15,200
multi-tenancy is near and dear

02:48:10,560 --> 02:48:19,120
in the telco networks and

02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:21,760
because the nature of uh the name space

02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:23,040
isolation which is offered in the

02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:26,000
kubernetes

02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:26,319
that presents uh quite a few challenges

02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,880
uh

02:48:26,319 --> 02:48:30,960
in terms especially for the vendors who

02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:34,240
are building this equipment

02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:36,479
uh it does uh create some challenges so

02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:37,359
we're looking at we're addressing them

02:48:36,479 --> 02:48:40,960
as part of

02:48:37,359 --> 02:48:42,880
sdn solutions and so forth uh

02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:44,080
and adding new functionality into the

02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:47,680
cni and so

02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:52,640
forth so but they're being sorted out

02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:52,640
as we as we go along yeah

02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:59,120
yeah we got another question about the

02:48:58,319 --> 02:49:01,279
copper

02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:02,640
so let me let me uh let me add some

02:49:01,279 --> 02:49:04,640
color about that

02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:07,600
copper is really expensive to maintain

02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:11,279
and a lot of it's really old

02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:15,279
so you know fiber is a whole lot easier

02:49:11,279 --> 02:49:17,680
to maintain once you put it in so

02:49:15,279 --> 02:49:19,920
the the telcoms are motivated to remove

02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:24,720
the copper

02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:24,720
how we can sell the copper make money at

02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:27,840
it

02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:34,399
all right any final questions for our

02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:41,840
panelists

02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:47,600
so we are ahead of schedule we are a

02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:51,120
little ahead of schedule but uh

02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:55,120
thank you again as ahmad beth and

02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:57,200
sukdev uh for joining us today

02:49:55,120 --> 02:49:59,840
and uh as a reminder for folks on the

02:49:57,200 --> 02:50:01,840
line the slides and presentations

02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:03,359
and that you did see today will be

02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:06,880
posted to the lf edge

02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:07,279
uh wiki shortly um i think aaron if we

02:50:06,880 --> 02:50:09,920
can

02:50:07,279 --> 02:50:12,960
advance to the next slide we're about

02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:12,960
ready to wrap it

02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:23,840
and i'll hand it over to i think jason

02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:24,240
is back on the line jason do you hear us

02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:26,399
yep

02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:28,000
i hear you guys hey so thanks to
