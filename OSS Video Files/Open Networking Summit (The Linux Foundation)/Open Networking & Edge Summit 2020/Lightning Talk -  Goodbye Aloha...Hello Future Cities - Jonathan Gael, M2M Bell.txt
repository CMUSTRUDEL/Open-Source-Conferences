hi i'm jonathan gale and my group has an

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,440
idea called

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,440
m2m bell a next-gen public utility for

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,200
the internet of things

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,719
it can only happen however if you'll

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,320
agree with this small group of

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,199
prestigious engineers

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,720
that it's time to say goodbye aloha

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
around 2000

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
the first wireless simulations for our

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,840
cable tv protocol were led by dr alonso

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
who then won awards from alcatel and

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,560
vodafone after being inspired by the

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,119
inventor

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,800
and my previous co-founder dr graham

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,640
campbell

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,719
dr campbell unfortunately passed away

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,719
last year before his vision

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
for a better way to send data packets

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,840
could be fully realized

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,840
and for that to happen

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,039
two decades of fundamental and applied

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,760
research needed to be

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,760
boiled down into the first fully drawn

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,520
protocol specification for which we won

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
a google research award about two years

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,120
ago with usc

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
this was pretty great at the time

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,000
because the award came with hardware

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,159
and engineering graduate students

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,880
but then the award got held up in china

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,880
citing fcc rules about not shipping any

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,040
unlocked wi-fi chips into the united

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,560
states

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,320
two years later our first corporate

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
collaboration is underway

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,000
but this time we're targeting a zigbee

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,640
mesh network

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,799
for employee safety systems but it is

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
still our goal to get back to the

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
wi-fi demo for voice and video

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,360
applications

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,720
to understand the potential impact of

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,640
the problem we've solved

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,479
one only needs to look at society's

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,119
historic internet problems

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,159
which carried into the world of wireless

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,360
mean that we're still

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,280
forcing wireless devices to think as if

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,399
they're wired which means automatically

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,119
eliminating

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,200
any possibility of taking advantage of

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,079
broadcasting despite its well-known

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,479
advantages

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,920
that gave ride rise to the world of tv

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,479
and radio

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
uh here's vince cerf godfather of the

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,040
net

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,680
to explain it we don't use broadcast

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
very well

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,879
we take a broadcast radio channel like

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,239
the 80211 wi-fi and we turn it into a

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,400
point-to-point link

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,319
we don't actually recognize in the

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
protocol sense that when you radiate

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,480
over the radio multiple sites may

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
actually hear the same data or if you're

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
radiating from the satellite

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
if you have the right protocols you

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
could take advantage of the fact that

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
hundreds of thousands or millions of

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,040
receivers get the same information

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
we just don't have protocols to do that

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,879
even though the underlying

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,280
communication system is capable of

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,160
delivering that service

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
well we do have protocols that do that

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,360
but again

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,360
first we need to say goodbye aloha

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,760
the main bottleneck in data networks

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,599
today stems from aloha which is still in

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,400
broad use in shared networks where

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,840
devices often compete to talk

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
which means they wake up at the same

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,440
time they try to grab the channel at the

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
same time but then they collide and they

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,800
try to resend over and over until the

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
packet goes through

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
so what's the problem well the problem

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,239
is on its best day

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
when all things are perfect which is

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,720
never the case in the real world

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
the efficiency tops out at about 50

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
percent

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,120
so if we continue to use a complex

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,440
solution instead of an

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,040
elegant solution then we can only expect

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,040
more of the same for the internet of

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,840
things

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,760
and this includes a very real social

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
dilemma regarding subscriber-based

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,599
networks backed by shareholders

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,000
versus a public utility with

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,959
telecommunications privacy laws

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,799
i mean treating customer data in ways

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,159
that might favor one customer over

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
another customer

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,400
based upon usage history is just

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,879
outright illegal

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,640
in a telecom framework but when it comes

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,040
to a data framework

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,560
this cornerstone of our democracy which

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,519
is privacy law

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,200
has taken the proverbial 180. then

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
consider the fact that the internet of

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,120
things hasn't even blossomed yet

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,360
and it's easy to come to the conclusion

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
that the social dilemma will only get

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,560
more invasive and more invisible

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,680
as the iot grows so how can we run

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
internet protocol

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,239
on trusted networks like we have with

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,680
the phone company

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,359
the answer is a technology called

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
distributed queuing

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,359
the first network to use our cable tv

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,960
broadcasting protocol

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:28,160
was iot world vq and my favorite part of

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,479
the cttc research page is the subtitle

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,320
distributed queuing is a revolutionary

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,840
technology that will change the way that

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,560
wireless networks operate

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,440
in the future they unfortunately just

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,600
didn't say when in the future

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,880
but if it's true then it's just a

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
firmware upgrade

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,919
and we can ultimately tilt the digital

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,360
landscape to the benefit of citizens and

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,520
privacy law

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
not marketing behemoths with thousands

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,280
of servers

00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:00,240
running ai intelligence

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,080
this key features list is kind of iot

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
mind-blowing i mean you don't have to be

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,240
an engineer to get some of these like

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,039
maximum stable performance or

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,680
performance independent of traffic load

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,120
so why isn't it available yet well the

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,720
short answer is that there's no

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,280
developer kit yet

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,960
um but the longer answer is that there

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,880
just seems to be more money and

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,639
incremental improvement

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
than there would be with a leap in

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
performance i mean just

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,639
ask yourself how many wi-fi routers did

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,240
you really want to buy over the last 20

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,520
years

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,639
regardless every single one of these key

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
features

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
is a result of that packet success rate

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,520
that you see in the table on

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,919
the right we have bucknell to thank for

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,000
going to work on the laura demo

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,680
they spent about 85 dollars building a

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,680
base station that covered most of

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
downtown philly

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,120
the main result was a capacity result

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,800
where they increased the number of

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,639
competing devices from

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,639
1700 to 5700

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,000
and i also have to draw attention to the

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,160
thesis title

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,800
which is of course a platform for

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
large-scale regional iot networks

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,960
because the secondary conclusion was

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,720
that if you put one of these inexpensive

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,000
base stations in every city in the state

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,479
of pennsylvania

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,240
you would have a mesh iot network that

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,280
covered 99

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,080
of the state's population so

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,400
unlike over-the-top iot hubs that don't

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,759
really do anything unless the homeowner

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,639
gives them a connection to their

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,840
internet service provider

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,240
a dq hub would simply join a regional

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,600
mesh network with other iot hubs

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
as needed using any unlicensed airwaves

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,080
that the fcc

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
has intended for free public use since

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,800
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,440
and regardless of all the reasons that

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,120
the iot has stalled since then

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,560
end to end bell's first operating

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
principle is

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
if we can get data from the first party

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
to the second party

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,560
without the third party well then why

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
wouldn't we

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,880
and why wouldn't we enforce the telecom

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
active 96

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,160
so that usage data is owned by the end

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,160
user by law

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,919
in terms of the economics imagine buying

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
an iot device with a lifetime of

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,440
connectivity included

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,000
after all if i can buy a home theater

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,120
system with a lifetime of dolby sound

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,720
processing

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,960
then it's not really very different

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,759
except that we're sending data packets

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,440
to an antenna as opposed to a speaker

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,680
and we don't mean to topple a bunch of

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,840
companies that are spending 2.7 trillion

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
to cover the globe with 5g

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,080
but come on guys it's been like 19 years

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,160
since 9 11

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,879
and they're first starting to see ads

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,039
for firstnet i mean obviously

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,599
it shouldn't take this long and it

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,599
shouldn't cost 2.7 trillion to build a

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,720
global radio infrastructure

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,879
nor should it cost 2.7 billion

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
in fact when it comes down to it all we

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,479
really need is commercial

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,560
off-the-shelf hardware a dedicated

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,960
hardware developer community

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,680
and device oems who want higher market

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,840
share for their solutions

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,199
i don't really expect to slow down the

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,199
5g train

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,960
but maybe we can still help it get where

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,560
it's going

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,560
here's a completely different group of

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
engineers from the far east

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,919
they've been twice published in the

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
vehicle technology section

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,160
in fact when you review their abstract

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,800
from their 2018 work

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
they actually renounced the aloha based

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,279
framework

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,599
they really used the word renounce going

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,000
well beyond the dubai metric

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,240
that barcelona had established so you

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,880
know hats off to this group for pushing

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,800
the 5g envelope for dq research

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,839
again with the result being in massive

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,839
access and dynamic priorities

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,920
in terms of our own publishing we shared

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,320
our dq specification with gm

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,440
engineers who put us in the sae journal

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,120
because they were

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,959
at the time pretty freaked out about

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,560
mission critical attacks like

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,000
applying the brakes while the car is

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,399
moving

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,120
and the second time our protocol was

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,480
published was by the patent office

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,120
it was written with the help of the

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,519
award-winning barcelona engineers

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,720
again with the goal of allowing any

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,519
engineer skilled

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,920
in the art to build an interoperable dq

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,920
system

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,760
so when we call dq universal we're not

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,680
talking about the physical universe

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,560
we're we're talking about the fact that

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,519
dq can

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,640
look like any type of switch so that one

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,160
network can serve

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,920
any type of device that said my dream

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
project would be to create a firmware

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,440
upgrade for central office

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,160
uh this would wake up that sleeping

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,880
goliath

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,480
with all of its copper connectivity and

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,600
at that point we would just need to plug

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
a wireless hub

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,519
into the old phone jack in the home the

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,959
best part is it would be powered with

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,360
three bolts from the co

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,200
instead of five volts from an ac adapter

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,200
and it would stay on in a power outage

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,440
so above all else the public needs

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,600
assurances which can

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
only be afforded by privacy laws that

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,720
started with our post office and shifted

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,200
to telecommunications around the 1930s

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,959
and if we can obviate the need for

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
multiple carriers carving up the

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,760
frequencies

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,440
and putting 5g antennas every 100 meters

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,640
in our neighborhoods and tens of

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,680
thousands of 5g

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,600
satellites up in the sky well

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,680
some engineers think that all of those

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
satellites might just disrupt the

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,519
ionosphere

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,120
and with each one of them shooting

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,000
millions of watts

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,519
so the question becomes is the linux

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,279
community

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,040
the same community that opened up the

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,120
operating system

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,720
is the linux community ready to do it

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,320
all over again

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,440
but this time with the goal to

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,279
commoditize switch routing hardware

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,279
as opposed to internet server hardware

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,480
if the name of this summit is any

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,839
indication

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,519
then we should know the answer to that

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,640
question and so i once again commit dq

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,720
as an open iot specification for the

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,720
goodbye the renouncement and the final

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,519
excommunication of aloha

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
accepting as in co-existence models

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,760
where we may need it for uh

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:29,839
still talking to older devices thank you

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:29,839
very much

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:12,399
right i don't see any questions yet

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,120
any of our listeners feel free to add

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,120
some questions

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,639
well again uh with or without questions

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,240
it was exciting for me to you know give

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,880
this presentation and to uh

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,320
pave the way for a world where we have

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,079
distributed applications

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,639
which for the first time can be

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,040
controlled on a distributed switch

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,920
you know where everything is under 100

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,440
edge control

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,839
again given the name of this conference

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,839
that should be interesting

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:21,839
comments doesn't have to be in the form

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:21,839
of a question

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
well here's a question which is better

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,440
50 efficiency or 98

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
efficiency

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,560
98 that's the answer i'm gonna have to

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,560
answer yeah 98

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,240
it's really a simple proposition who

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,079
wants a brighter light bulb

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,279
and we're below the internet protocol

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,800
layer

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,959
so we just give ip a better road to run

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,959
on

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,320
well sounds good we do have the slack

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,279
channel listed in the chat if you want

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,639
to continue the conversation

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,720
but i will leave up to you jonathan if

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,880
you want to end it

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,120
yeah we can end it and i'll uh flip over

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,160
to slack and see if anybody has any

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,680
questions they haven't thought of yet

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,519
thank you so much for your time jonathan

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:31,839
appreciate it my pleasure

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:31,839
take care from l.a
