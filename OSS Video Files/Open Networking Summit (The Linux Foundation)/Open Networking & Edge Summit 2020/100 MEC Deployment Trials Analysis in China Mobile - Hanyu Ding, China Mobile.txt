it's a great honor to be here to share

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,120
with you

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:11,519
the china mobile's 5g mac development

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,759
strategy and application exploration

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,720
and setting for the industrial customers

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
i'm han you ding and a man a project

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,680
manager from

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,760
china mobile and uh

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,880
the combination of mec and 5g is

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,920
a core starting point for the operator

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,520
to upgrade their networks and

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,200
services and expand new customers and

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,000
new fields operators are required to

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,360
expand their mobile connection business

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,480
newly expanded

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,160
2b enterprise network market

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,760
use connection at the starting point

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,239
develop ad computing service

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,640
and newly expand edge commuting service

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,640
market

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
expand the bitterness of 2b vertical in

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,479
that view

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,080
enable the digitalization of

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,920
various industries like manufacturing

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,320
electric power security or

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,360
current networking and develop

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,600
time-sensitive

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,000
and location-sensitive industrial

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,520
applications and service

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,479
at the same time it it also takes into

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,920
account

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,759
account the self operated uh

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,799
ott 2c service of operators such as

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,119
embbb uh hd radio

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:46,720
aware of uh so now i will introduce the

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,000
uh msa strategy and development

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,200
strategy in china mobile uh with the

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,920
three sections the first

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,479
i will introduce the mec technical

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
layout

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,520
in china mobile

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,399
as you know as computing is a converged

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,520
system with both

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,280
5g network capabilities

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,720
and cloud computing capabilities

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,640
providing low latency and high security

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,560
security cloud at cloud edge top

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,400
service for extra patients

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,440
we often see that the foj changes

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
leaves and brings people into the arrow

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,200
of

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
mobile into night then the goal of 5g is

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,800
not only for

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,480
life communication for the public but

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,920
also for the production and

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,800
social governance to achieve the

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,800
interconnection for everything

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,599
so the 5g network in china mobile

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,640
include as for

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,920
the edge computing it

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,360
includes the local offloading

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,959
so the upf is the key to making edge

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,040
computing work

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:12,159
factory network capabilities are open to

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,920
third-party applications

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,879
such as wellness position capabilities

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
which are provided from the base station

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,800
side

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:27,360
to the um edge application

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,799
platform and open to the add

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,319
edge computing applications through the

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,319
restful api course

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,560
at the same time channel mobile will

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,080
also provide

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,959
the cloud service for small and medium

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,959
enterprises

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,920
first we can provide the ice as service

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,280
so we can provide the customers

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,080
with uh computing storage and

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,720
network virtualization resources and

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:06,239
proud applications with virtual machine

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:09,280
and container image management services

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,799
so second we can also provide the path

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
service

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
a channel mobile edge computing platform

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,799
will integrate

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
capabilities of different vertical

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,519
industrial

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,800
power such as the video encoding or

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,840
decoding

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,080
ai reason name or device protocol

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,040
conversions and the network features

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
just

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
as i just mentioned before which will be

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,280
provided to

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,120
customers through the secondary

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,400
packaging

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,639
api interface

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,479
therefore as channel mobile's edge

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,520
computing

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,680
it can provide users with a cloud

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,040
service and factory network service at

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,479
the same time

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,280
and cloud cloud network

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,800
collaboration can empower vertical

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,919
industrial

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,639
for the section 2 i will

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:14,880
introduce the development strategy

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,880
of edge computing in china mobile

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,960
among the 100 china mobile family

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,080
leading trails project

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,360
at least 60 percent have the clear

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,360
edge computing demand

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,080
there uh there are

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,039
for the sixty percent uh edge computing

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,280
demands

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:42,400
uh there are two kind of for um services

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,680
one is to be service and one is

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,120
the other is a 2b2c service

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,320
so of all of this um

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,520
ash computing trails has the

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,160
following characteristics first

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,520
as they are requirements for they are

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,319
all requirements

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,680
for the have the requirements for the

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
upf

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,400
so all s component service has a

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,360
requirements for the business of loading

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,080
the trade to business of loading as the

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,199
design of

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,240
5g transfer and control

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:23,039
separation upf

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,240
can sync closer to user

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,120
and the second characteristic as a

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,840
deployment

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:36,000
location can be in operators

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:39,280
operators side or on the

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,280
customer side generally speaking

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:46,639
the service um that require data

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,680
locally processing and

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,280
they are preferred to be deployed in the

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,319
customer's own uh site

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,599
and for the uh operations

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:04,720
and uh maintenance uh provided by the

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,199
uh and for the customers on um

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,360
on site the operations and maintenance

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,240
are provided by the customer or a third

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
party

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
otherwise the customer will require

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,400
deployment

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,759
in operator's computer side

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,560
and the maintenance and

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,759
can be provided by the operator or

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,840
assert

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,280
so now um i will introduce the business

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,759
development strategy

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,720
in china mobile the edge computing

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,000
applications

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,039
are divided divided into

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,879
local and general and the first

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:48,160
priority can be given to service

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:52,639
which have low technical entrance

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,840
threshold and high intensity

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,680
as shown in the figure below we have

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,720
conducted a systematic analysis of

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,000
edge computing business scene

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,120
of the local and general business

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,319
and comprehensively analyze the

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,840
industrial entry threshold and

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,759
industrial maturity to analyze the

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,720
degree of demand for edge computing

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,919
the bitterness scenarios that are closer

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,199
to the

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,759
orange of the coordinates

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,319
are some of the scenarios that we

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,880
believe

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,880
should be deployed first

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,719
because they have the high industrial

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,159
maturity

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,880
and the low technicals we should

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,279
for the local business with a clear user

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,760
need

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
and the low technical interest rate as

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080
the full

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,720
folders of um

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
cmcc recently development of az

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,200
computing

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,279
this type of business generally has a

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,320
strong demand for the use of factory

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,680
networks

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,360
and data processing locally

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,959
so general business this

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,080
they are concentrated in industrials

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,760
such as automatic driving um

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,120
high hd uh radio they are

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,560
they have high demand and market

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
maturity general business generally have

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,600
the high

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,200
requirements for the low latency and

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,839
large bandwidth

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,600
capabilities of 5g plus

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,720
mec it requires a long

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,839
term deployment

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,279
section 3 um i will introduce the new

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,640
protests

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,399
new practice in china mobile for the

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,839
edge company introduced the channel

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,880
mobile's latest

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,160
latest practice in the field of

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,440
edge computing um so

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,120
making full use of china mobile's fmg

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,240
network cloud network integration and

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,120
eco logic convergence

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,640
channel mobile aims to provide partners

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,839
with the network

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,040
age cloud one stop

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,320
solution and we can

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,360
provide default capabilities to

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,800
help application developers to use

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,920
5g plus mec service

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,560
so the first how we can supply the 5g

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,640
network

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,760
capabilities uh we can provide the

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,120
industrial slicing provided
