hello welcome to day three

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
of keynotes uh good morning good

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,360
afternoon

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,919
good evening good night as i always say

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,560
um

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,360
i'm personally very impressed with the

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
quality of

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,080
content and speakers so really thank you

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,519
to the community for making this

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,279
fantastic event happen uh we're getting

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,320
some very good feedback on

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,360
social media and you know good to go

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,040
so uh today i'll

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
you know introduce speakers as they come

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,480
along but we have some

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,720
very cool innovation leaders uh speaking

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,839
and you absolutely want to hear what

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,800
they have to say

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,959
uh let me start off by saying uh and

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,399
introducing our first speaker today

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:15,360
uh farah papuyuano

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,120
uh she is a leader she's a co-founder

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
and president of edgeworks

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,880
and without any further ado uh please

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,839
welcome

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,839
far

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
hi arpet thank you for the introduction

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,000
incredibly happy to be here today

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,000
uh to talk about edge computing

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,680
so i'll get to my first slide here and

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
um

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,720
today i'm going to talk about the rise

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,519
of edge computing and really

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
accelerating

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
real world applications we all care

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,080
about edge computing which is why we're

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,519
at the conference today

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
but really what we've been asking

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,360
ourselves and the market's been asking

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
us our investors have been asking us

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
when is rubber really going to meet the

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,480
road

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,160
when are we actually going to see these

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
real world applications starting to come

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
out

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,240
so a little bit about myself um who's

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,160
far rp and why am i listening to her at

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,279
nine o'clock on a wednesday morning um

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
as arpa mentioned

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,279
uh i am the co-founder of edge computing

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,440
company called edwards

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,920
and uh i've been building the edge um

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,279
through the startup since 2017. so

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,120
been doing this for a little bit of time

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,160
now uh we are the creators of the

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
eclipse io5

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,800
project uh it's an edge project that's

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,240
open source under the eclipse foundation

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,600
i also sat on the board of directors of

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
the eclipse foundation and how for a

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,959
couple of years

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,680
um and uh prior to that i was an

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,279
investor

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,600
uh before uh

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,040
after my years as an operator and spent

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
the last 10 years

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,120
uh looking at the next technologies to

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,440
invest in so obviously spend time

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,640
investing in cloud computing big data

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,560
storage um and that journey ai that

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,519
journey led me to edge computing because

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,120
it seemed

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,800
natural to me that um you know all that

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
data that's being generated outside of

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,120
the

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,800
cloud and data center wasn't going to be

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,240
shuttled back to the to the cloud for

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
processing and so we're going to need a

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,839
new way of doing this

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,839
um

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,240
so the question i get asked most often

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,399
and you know anyone in the edge industry

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,360
who could probably test this is what is

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,959
the edge

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,399
you know but the real question we should

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,200
be asking ourselves is

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,200
where is the edge

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
and i'm going to take a contrarian

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,000
position on this you know i'm sure we've

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
heard about

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,240
hey this is the mobile edge this is the

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,320
telco edge this is the you know

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,160
enterprise edge this is the iot edge

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
i'm not even sure i've got those labels

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,440
correct but i know

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
um there are these distinct edges and

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,399
i'm here to say that

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,480
i don't think that that's the way we

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,320
should be approaching the edge

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
in my view the edge is anything that

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,920
sits outside of a cloud and

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,440
as a part of a cloud edge continuum and

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
the reason for this is if we think about

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,279
edges in these siloed ways

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,880
the mobile edge the iot edge the

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,600
enterprise act then we're going to be

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,959
starting to build stacks that way our

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,560
architectures are going to be

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,680
designed for those pieces of hardware

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
our software stacks are going to be

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,600
designed

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,680
and we're going to start to be building

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,800
these silos when in effect

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,760
um most companies who have complex

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,440
infrastructure

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,959
have things running on a variety of

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,720
different things they don't just have

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,920
things running on a telco edge and the

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
cloud they just don't have things

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,720
running

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,639
on an iot edge and in the cloud and i

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,880
have customers that uh we work with

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,839
that you know like i'll take a car

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
company as an example

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
they're running things on their cars

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,639
okay that would be maybe considered the

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,160
sort of endpoints they have things

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
running on roadside units they have

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,800
things

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399
they want to run on the light structures

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,519
they have things that are running in

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,760
micro data centers

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,200
they're aggregating them at colos

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,760
they're working with the

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,360
cell towers and carriers to run things

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,040
on on the cell edge

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,480
and then they're putting all that data

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,880
back in the cloud

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,639
for them the edges incredibly fluid and

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,279
it may be today that they may want to

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,880
run things at the cell tower because

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,800
for a certain reason and then they may

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
want to orchestrate that closer to

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,880
uh the end points because of latency or

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,560
whatnot if we build these edges

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,639
inc differently then that's going to be

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,399
incredibly difficult to do

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,639
if we can make the edges look seamless

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,480
then they can move these things around

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,480
with no problem at all and so that that

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,480
is the view that i see for the edge

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
so how do we take these two things that

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,360
are incredibly different

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,880
and make them look seamless right when

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,760
you think about the cloud we think about

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,639
deploying

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,320
a one 5000 node cluster in a very

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,680
homogenous environment

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,040
with the expectation of aha networking

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,399
versus at the edge where we'll see 5001

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
node clusters in an incredibly

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,959
heterogeneous environment

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,240
where networking is incredibly varied uh

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
you have different network topologies

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,279
that you have to deal with and the

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,959
expectation is that edge nodes will

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,480
disappear from time to time

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,000
and minutes hours even days and that's

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
not considered out of the ordinary

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,320
so that leads us to the rise of what i

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
like to think of as edge native

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
computing

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,560
so it's at this point i'm going to ask

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
you guys to

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,839
speak nerd

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,320
um what this is basically saying is that

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,440
edge native should extend

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,279
cloud native and what i mean by that

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,199
is you know we all know what cloud

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,320
native is for sitting at this conference

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,399
anyway um

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,959
and it's incredibly important to you

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,279
know how we build cloud computing

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,360
cloud nato really focuses on the central

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,839
question of how we deliver applications

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,839
uh the delivery of elastic scalability

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,959
on

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,199
because i know you guys know what that

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,639
is you know the development

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,920
methodologies

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,959
what edge native does is really embrace

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,160
those principles

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,560
but extend that um to the edge and what

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,480
i

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,399
mean by that is like on the surface if

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,480
you use cloud native principles

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,760
um at the edge you can make the surface

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,399
look exactly the same

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,760
for uh the developers but the

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,160
complexities of the edge

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,120
the disparate hardware the network

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,079
challenges

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,040
the location you can abstract that away

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,560
and

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,639
really focus on how do i bring those

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
primitives forward in a way that allows

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,079
me to take advantage of

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
the goodness that they provide without

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,000
worrying about the complexity so the

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
development

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
methodology and the tooling that we use

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,920
is still

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,920
very much the same

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,440
and it may help for me to contextualize

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,040
this with an example

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
and i'm going to use kubernetes because

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,720
of course we're sitting here

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,880
as a part of the cncf and i know

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,880
everyone here knows what kubernetes is

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
um whether you're technical or not

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
you've at least heard of it

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,000
and so i actually did a google search

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,360
and found this diagram from

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,480
an edge computing company and i'm not

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,079
it's not here to pick on them which is

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,959
why i didn't put their name here

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,360
um but this is pretty common here where

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,959
um

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
they're trying to take kubernetes and

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,800
bring it down to the edge and anyone

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,880
who's

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,959
uh spent any time in the edge industry

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,800
knows that all the companies are rushing

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,240
to think about how do we take kubernetes

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
to the engine

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,000
ultimately kubernetes was built for the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,480
cloud kubernetes was built

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,199
really well for a one 5000 node cluster

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,880
where

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
um we really don't care where things are

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,199
running and we expect high levels of

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,959
network connectivity and so you know

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,079
basically what this company's done is

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,680
taken the uh those principles and really

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,199
brought it down to the edge and said

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,720
okay well i'm going to basically build a

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,839
mini cloud

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,120
i'm going to take an edge which is

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,279
typically thought of as maybe

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,959
five one five thousand one node clusters

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,839
create a three node environment provide

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,040
ha which is

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,480
not uh really considered um really uh

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,040
common in edge environments

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
and try to use kubernetes to orchestrate

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,439
the thought is right

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,280
but the execution um

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,439
is not really taking advantage of edge

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,880
native principles if you think about it

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,240
from an edge native standpoint

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
what you would like to be able to do is

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,280
still leverage kubernetes but

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,280
you would like to orchestrate it in a

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
different way and at the edge i care

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,559
about

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,919
um what type of hardware i'm running so

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,559
perhaps if i'm

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,199
taking a ai microservice i may want to

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,280
care about

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,440
well does the hardware have you know an

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,600
ai accelerator like a gpu

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,640
um so maybe or kubernetes wants to go

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,120
and look for that

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,080
uh i care about latency i perhaps need

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,080
it within a certain level of

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,600
microseconds from a certain endpoint

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,120
so maybe i can tell kubernetes to

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,400
orchestrate for that um

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,320
i care about um location perhaps i need

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
to run it on a certain factory floor

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,360
for security concerns or for gdpr

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
requirements

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,600
so what we want to do is obviously allow

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,600
kubernetes to

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,520
think about these attributes and take

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,840
kubernetes and create

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,440
an edge to our scheduler such that we

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,000
can extend kubernetes down to the edge

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
so

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
cloud developers don't have to learn an

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,160
entirely new paradigm for development

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,840
uh but they can take advantage of what

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,840
is useful at the edge

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,039
so why is everyone rushing to take

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,559
kubernetes to the edge is it just a fad

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,840
is it just the thing to do or is there a

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,840
real rhyme or reason behind it

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,120
and the reason is this um we've spent

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
the last

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,400
15 plus years investing in the cloud you

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,080
know

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,160
this entire foundation the cloud native

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,000
computing foundation is entirely built

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,000
around the cloud

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,360
and we've got a lot of tooling there

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,840
we've got a lot of

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,880
developers there everything has really

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,360
been focused there

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,080
but the data is now coming out from the

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
edge

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,120
and the data growth there is going to be

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,559
exponential and most of the data growth

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,080
over the next 30 years is going to be

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,559
coming from there so how do we bridge

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,559
that gap

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,000
in order to do so we really must unlock

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,360
the power of cloud developers

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,720
edge developers don't actually exist

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,679
today i mean the only edge developers

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
are the ones who've been

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,720
working on these products for some time

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,840
now and we now consider ourselves to be

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,720
edge developers

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,200
but cloud developers there are so many

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,200
of them

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,640
and we need to leverage them to build

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
and deploy edge applications which is

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,200
why we want edge data to

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
be a corollary to uh cloud cloud native

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,799
so that they can

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,640
leverage existing tooling existing

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,640
principles and existing methodologies

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,600
so why is there so much confusion in the

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,280
market today and why are haven't

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,880
developers gotten it yet

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,720
and so um i can say this as a member

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,480
a sitting board member of an open source

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,600
foundation and

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,080
a major contributor to contributor to an

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,919
open source

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,120
project that we are being incredibly

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,360
stupid about this

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,919
our shelves included and we're adding to

00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,919
the confusion

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,000
i still believe that the future is going

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,000
to be built through open source

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
we've seen this proved out in the cloud

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
we've seen this proved out in the

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,559
internet we've seen this

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,919
proved out in big data this will also be

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,360
done

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,840
with edge computing as well

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,120
and how are we contributing to this

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,520
confusion by asking ourselves

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,280
which is best uh you know and i get this

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,120
question all the time i really like i o

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
fog but i need to go out and see which

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,760
one is best

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,200
i really like edgex foundry but i really

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,400
need to go out and see which

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,280
is best i can't be a part of the uh

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,039
eclipse edge nato project because um our

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,520
companies decided to take a bet on elf

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,600
edge

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,280
i can't be a part of lf edge because my

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,559
company's decided to take a bet on the

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,679
eclipse edge native

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,720
and um you know all these projects sit

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
across all of these different

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,000
foundations and they all operate and

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
solve different things some focus on the

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,799
far edges

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,799
and and they all set as a part of the

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,840
continuum all the way up to the cloud

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,480
some focus on uh development and

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
deployment

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,039
and some focus all the way up to

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
operations and they're sitting at

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,600
different things

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,000
solving different problems the question

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,480
out that is being asked which is best

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,640
is uh akin to asking well which is

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,880
better kubernetes or terraform

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
which is better kafka or hadoop now we

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
know now we know enough about big data

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080
to know that's a silly question right

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
um and often we're going to use both

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
kafka and hadoop because they solve

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720
different things

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,360
they neither one can do all of solve

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,120
everything

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,559
and which is the same in all these

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,919
projects neither one can solve all of

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,120
these projects neither foundation is

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,640
going to solve all these products

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,480
but what we've been doing up until now

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,880
is focusing on inaudible it's like

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,240
okay you know how do i position io fog

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
and how do i promote io fog

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,799
and i'm going to pick an iphone because

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,559
that's the project that you know um uh

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,240
we've contributed to how do i push that

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,840
one and say that this one is the best

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,640
and that's really not what we need to be

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,080
doing

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,840
what we need to be doing is showing the

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,080
developers

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,120
how to build easy to use interoperable

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,440
building bricks

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,799
cloud developers today now know if they

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
need to build an application if they

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,120
need

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,960
you know what pieces of open source

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,400
software to use okay i need hadoop i

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,320
need kafka i need uh

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,240
kubernetes orchestrate i you know i need

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,000
terraform to you know

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,600
automate my infrastructure they know how

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,720
to put all these things together and we

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,640
as the foundations

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,640
have not made this easy for developers

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,960
if i were to ask my kids today

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,039
which lego built brick is better the

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,640
long one or the short one

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,320
the big wheels or the small wheels they

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,760
look at me as if i'm crazy because

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
in order to build out the things that

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,240
they want to build they're going to use

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,120
all of these pieces and that's pretty

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,360
much the questions

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,039
we've been kind of posing to the to the

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,799
to the developers and this is the things

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,360
that they've been going through today

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,720
so i provided a sample clouds or a

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,480
sample stack

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
uh from the cloud edge continuum to show

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
kind of how these pieces would work

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,039
together

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,799
for the cloud obviously um you know we

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,000
have cloud vms and kubernetes is a great

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,640
orchestrator for the cloud

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,679
uh you know we as a company love it um

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
you know we've actually

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,280
taken io fog and i'm not here to promote

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,400
any one piece of technology but we've

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,880
taken io fog

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,679
and created an edgeware scheduler um you

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,080
know

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,760
i really believe that open source

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,280
technologies are stronger together so

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,600
you know we teamed up with scupper which

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,919
wasn't uh originally designed for the

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,679
edge but did great with multi-cloud and

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,200
building a mesh and so we combined those

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,919
together to build

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,440
uh an edge mesh um and they're become a

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,000
major contributor to the project

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,679
um on top of that we have ditto and hana

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,600
again um edge projects

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,960
on the edge stack you know you could

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,120
take any hardware note

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
and project eve would be a great layer

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,600
to sit on top of these edge notes and

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,600
take advantage of

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,679
uh what what the notes have to offer you

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,120
know we like to think about it as

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,640
them like kind of like vmware for the

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,600
edge maybe they wouldn't position

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,039
themselves that way but

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,120
they have some powerful tooling that we

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,360
can leverage on top of that

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,240
uh you know using io fog and again

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,159
scupper to orchestrate the edge and

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,360
figure out where to deploy uh these

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,159
micro services

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,840
edgex foundry has a number of powerful

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,360
micro services that allow us to talk to

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,520
different types of machine and tooling i

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,000
hope i can't do that and neither can eve

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,880
um mosquito does great work for

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,320
translation

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,400
hockey allows us to um you know uh

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,760
uh deploy firmware and do over-the-air

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,679
upgrades on top of that

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,360
that now allows us to you know in

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,919
putting these pieces together allows us

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,679
to now

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,200
just really focus on okay what are the

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,840
applications that we can build

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,799
you know ai ml applications iot

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,480
applications

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,919
uh these are things developers know how

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,360
to do right if we can just give them the

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,120
pieces for the edge stack

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,840
um they can just go and do what they

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,840
know how to do best

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,960
sorry work bear with me here while i

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,480
move this to the next slide here

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,919
um so

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,520
again i'm not here to push any one thing

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,000
but i want to kind of give an ex an

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,679
example

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,679
of how this comes together in the real

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,000
world so you know obviously

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,679
the um covenant has really hit everybody

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,320
and you know this pandemic

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,600
came at us hard in march and is still

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,600
sitting around here today

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,039
at the time you know our company thought

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,080
hey uh

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,360
you know my kids were actually going

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,440
back to school and they were taking

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,200
temperatures with a manual thermometer

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,400
and you know i thought to myself there's

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
got to be a better way to do this for my

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
kid who actually really hates being

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,440
having his temperature taken

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,799
and so you know thinking about some of

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,360
the edge stacks that we've built

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,240
um for other customers we thought hey we

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,559
can do this

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,799
um very easily leveraging open source

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,760
technology we were able to take this

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,400
from concept to a you know mvp in six

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,120
weeks

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
if it had taken us months or years uh we

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
would this

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,279
opportunity would have passed us by and

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,360
if we had to build all of this

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,480
software for from scratch or sit around

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,520
and try and figure out which is best

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,600
that never would have been done

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,120
what we did was and of course um you

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,640
know our team has

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,320
familiarity with all of these uh

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,360
different pieces of ed software we took

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,600
these open source

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,720
technologies that um exist today and

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,320
combine these lego

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,559
bricks together to create um

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,000
uh this solution in like i said six

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,960
weeks do i have a team of edge

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,120
developers nope

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,559
they're all cloud developers um and you

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,080
know within six weeks they're able to

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,240
create this and say okay well i

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,279
these ai models detect detect people do

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
live in the cloud so

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,799
we were able to leverage that onto the

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,640
edge uh we were able to

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,880
zero in on forehead we were able to

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,640
detect masks uh we were able to detect

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,799
symptoms all these like ai models are

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,240
not new um and

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,320
if we were able to teach other

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,960
developers to do this then they can do

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,600
this as well

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,440
and so you know now we've had some

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,200
developers come to us and say well

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,559
you know i don't really care about uh i

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,000
mean obviously they care about code but

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,320
you know the use case that i care about

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,159
is

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,840
being able to check people in you know

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,799
um i want to use facial recognition to

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,240
see when people

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,400
come to work and when people leave

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,960
because um in other parts of the world

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,240
they'll

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,080
sign people up and other people will

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,679
show up to do the job and so

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,080
um you know we they they said can we use

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
this

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,679
developer stack to you know deploy these

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,240
different models it's just a matter of

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,919
swapping out these pieces sure why not

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,240
um you know with in the last

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,760
uh two months uh fires have been a big

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,400
issue here in california so i thought

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
hey

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,760
we're just if we can deploy things at

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,760
the edge keeping the

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,799
edge lego brick building books the same

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,799
and just swapping out

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,080
these different models couldn't we just

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,279
take an inputs to now

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,960
detect fire do video over uh ai over

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,360
video to detect when the fire

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,880
breaks out to take inputs such as

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,399
dryness humidity

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,000
um you know and start to detect hey

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,440
these are potential fire hot spots

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,440
obviously i care about this now since my

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,640
kids haven't like breathed fresh air in

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,480
the last couple of months

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,559
but you know we want to be able to

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,240
combine these building blocks such that

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,840
everyone can do this all developers can

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,720
do this and it's at the point at which

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,640
we can do this

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,000
at that we'll see these real world

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:49,360
applications really emerge and the

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:51,679
rubber to hit the road

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,200
so to really summarize the the point i'm

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,200
really trying to make here is that

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,200
we really want to unlock the power of

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,480
cloud developers without the developers

00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,679
the promise of the edge is going to

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
suffer and we're going to be suffering

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,559
this

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,000
hype cycle of death and i know you know

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,799
we hear this a lot i know we try to

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
pretend that

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,840
people aren't skeptical about the edge

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
they are um

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,960
and you know i i think that's it's

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,640
premature

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,640
you know vc's have kind of written this

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,360
off and said hey you know i'm skeptical

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
about the edge

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,399
i i think they're going to be proven

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,880
wrong at some point once the developers

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,159
come

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,919
the edge will come and we saw this with

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,559
big data too i was an investor in big

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,480
data

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,679
and you know we all rushed to big data

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,600
and then all of a sudden you know things

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,000
weren't materializing in it and it took

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,760
a number of years to the point where

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,360
people made it easy for developers to

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,559
develop big data applications that you

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,440
know big data took off and

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,080
you know we're starting to see that that

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
explode

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,799
same thing will happen with edge it's

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,159
just a matter of getting the developers

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,840
to there

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,520
in order to do so we must make it as

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,159
simple to develop for the edge as we do

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
for the cloud

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,760
again by leveraging edge native

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,520
techniques um we can

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,039
enable developers to use the same tools

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,760
same techniques and use the same

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,279
developers

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,640
right there's tons of cloud developers

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,159
today and they're the ones who are

00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,440
trying to get more and more data up into

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,039
their

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,600
cloud environments so we want to

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,600
leverage them

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,880
we want to be able to work as a

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,720
community to detangle the confusion

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,559
about edge development open source not

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,840
add to it i know we want to promote

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,000
our projects and we want to promote our

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,440
foundations but um a better promotion

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,880
would be figuring out how these pieces

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,240
work together so people can actually use

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,600
them there's no better

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,200
um you know reward or there's no better

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,480
um accolade than seeing developers

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,960
actually use the technologies that we

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,720
built

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,559
and no one lego big can solve the

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
problem if i were to like give my kid

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,600
one brick and said here you go

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,200
hear your legos i think you'd be very

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,279
disappointed with what i brought home

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,559
um having these different lego building

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,399
blocks allows us to build

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,240
different sorts of applications that

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,960
allows us to solve unique problems and

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
challenges

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,760
some challenges are going to have broad

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,120
appeal some challenges are going to be

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,679
unique to certain organizations

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,720
we want to be able to give those lego

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,080
bricks to people

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,320
and allow them to create these

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,320
applications

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,000
and we need to do all of this to drive

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,880
long-term adoption of revenue and market

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,240
growth for the edge

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,000
ultimately people are waiting for the

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,520
edge market to appear and it's the

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,520
developers that are going to drive us

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
there

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,320
so you know i'm going to leave you this

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,159
final to party thought

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,080
the edge really depends on developers

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,440
and it's incumbent on us

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,200
to help them get there um and that's

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,960
that's the goal for for what we're doing

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,679
today at these foundations is what i

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,679
hope for the future

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:40,320
thank you thank you farah

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,440
this was amazing and i i like your two

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,760
call to actions

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,440
uh and and kind of statements here

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,440
obviously developers

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,640
are great we are in a developer centric

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,360
conference here so

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,360
you know perfect venue for this i also

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,840
agree that you know edge is a horizontal

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,000
cons

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,000
construct across the different markets

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,679
whatever you want to call it telco cloud

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,279
enterprise iot

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,799
and then i think the call to action on

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,799
collaboration across

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,159
both foundations and projects is

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,080
extremely critical

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,200
but even more critical to look at it

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
from a lens of

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,559
use cases and actual deployment

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,080
scenarios so really appreciate your

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,240
your thoughts here let's move on to a a

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,519
a key lightning uh talk here or a

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,440
keynote from

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,640
one of the well-known entities of open

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,559
source uh

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,640
software right um i think everybody

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,480
knows tom nadeau from red hat he's the

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,960
technical director that

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,919
there and he has been participating in

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,960
pretty much

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,120
everything open so let's hear on what he

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,080
has to say about sort of the 2020 focus

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
priorities and vision

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
tom

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,480
well good afternoon everybody uh welcome

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,919
to o nes

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,519
2020 um my name is tom nadeau um i'm

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,279
technical director at red hat

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,679
and i wanted to welcome everybody to the

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,360
conference uh we've got some exciting

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,480
things going on

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,760
uh for you all to to check out uh over

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,559
the next couple of days

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,120
um i've been a just a little background

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,159
on me

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,279
um i run a couple of teams at red hat

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,480
around telco partner engineering and uh

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,679
most interestingly

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,880
for this conference uh networking uh

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,600
at red hat and specifically

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,559
uh we've been working um on a variety of

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,720
the projects here

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,120
at uh lf and lfe glf networking

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,320
um and so i'm really excited about the

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,159
various things that are

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,399
that are going on at the conference uh

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,720
today so what i'd like to do

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,919
is uh highlight a couple of key areas

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
that

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,159
uh that i've been thinking about and and

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,519
that perhaps you can

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,679
sort of think about as you go through

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,519
the different sessions uh over the next

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,240
couple of days

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,600
these are areas that have come out of

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,679
myself and my teams

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,600
working on very specific projects and

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,799
for very various different customer

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,000
deployments

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,559
around these areas so things to

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,840
just sort of look forward to uh during

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,279
the next couple of days

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,679
um so my my

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,840
my first area uh i think that of

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,519
interest is

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,960
um to look forward to and there's a lot

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,559
of really interesting things going on

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,159
today the evolution of linux

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,159
linux kernel networking and linux

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,159
networking um

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,000
here in this area you know we've seen an

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,159
evolution

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,320
of linux networking over the last couple

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,159
of years um

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,440
pertaining to supporting a variety of

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,600
different technology

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,600
technological changes but specifically

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,039
to support virtualization

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:58,159
so we've seen a lot of hardware offload

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,760
types of types of editions

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,000
and various other things to support

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,760
virtual machines and now most recently

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,480
we've seen a lot of work going on in

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,840
container

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,280
networking and that's particularly where

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,599
my teams have been spending a lot of

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,200
time recently and there's

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,520
a variety of really interesting

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,720
presentations on the topics

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,480
uh for example malthus and

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,800
service mesh which actually gets me into

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,720
my next topic which is uh multi-cluster

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,879
federation

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,639
again related to very closely to

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,879
container networking

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,960
um multi-cluster federation and

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,440
multi-cluster connectivity

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,440
in general is a very interesting topic

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,560
these days

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,399
specifically because generally speaking

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,889
folks don't use a single data center a

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,119
single geographic

00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:52,879
[Music]

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:56,240
uh location for it uh for compute

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,880
uh storage etc and being able to

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,760
uh federate and and mesh those things

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,320
together in a

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,000
in a way that is appropriate for

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,480
microservices

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,359
is an ongoing challenge that you'll see

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,200
a lot of

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,119
presentations on including one that i'm

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,119
doing with a colleague of mine

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,640
further down the road um another area to

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,359
focus on is

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,000
uh operations and specifically operators

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,400
um

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,040
i i think we've done a lot of good work

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,240
at

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,200
the lf over the last few years uh on

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,960
projects like opnv

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,640
and even onapp that have tried to bring

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,240
in the operator perspective

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,520
um in a in a perhaps a non

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,440
developer targeted way and that's been

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,400
very good but i think we need to do

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,800
more work on this and i for example am

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,920
on a

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,000
uh moderating a panel um

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
during during the conference with a

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,200
variety of network operators to really

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,800
to get their perspective

00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,480
and that really should be

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,119
something that'll be interesting for

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,960
everybody to take a look at

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,320
because ultimately the folks that have

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,280
to use

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,400
the technologies we build uh should have

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
a really good say in

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,839
in how they're constructed

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,320
another interesting area is the

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,960
evolution of container networking again

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,800
i mentioned

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,400
earlier uh maltese and and mesh

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,560
there's a variety of other interesting

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,640
things in the space too that you'll see

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,480
during the next few days and that's a

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,119
very interesting thing because

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,480
container network is pretty much the hot

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,680
topic these days

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,119
especially as it pertains to some of the

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,000
new 5g viran

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,760
and edge and mech types of use cases and

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,760
deployments that we're going towards

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,119
and then creating solutions and fewer

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,599
lego blocks is another

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,240
sort of area that i think we need to

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,200
look at

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,760
um i'm on sitting on another panel this

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,280
week

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,680
um uh about the various edge projects

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,200
and

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,720
linux foundation edge and here um

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,640
you know while there's been a lot of

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,200
really good work in in this space

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,800
uh one of the concerns is is around

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,599
having too many solutions

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,079
uh if if that's possible and so look

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,320
there

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,760
uh and and hopefully participate to help

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,880
us narrow that area down

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,839
and then a couple of other

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,200
uh really important areas for me are um

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,760
better project governance

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,480
uh really getting involved um i mean we

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,160
do have

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,079
certain projects where there is a lot of

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,040
heavy developer

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,160
involvement and governance but in a few

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,280
others there's really

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,640
there's a lot of folks that are not as

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,800
closely

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,680
uh involved in the in the day-to-day

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,320
development as

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,320
as we really could have and that would

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,680
really improve the project

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,160
and then finally i really look forward

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,960
to

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,160
supporting developers even more so than

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,440
we are today

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,200
linux foundation and its projects um

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,040
traditionally have been very developer

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,000
oriented and supported

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,480
and i hope we can continue uh in that

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,359
vein

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,960
and you'll see a number of pro uh

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,119
presentations this week

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,160
from actual developers developing the

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,359
various projects

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,839
and and i encourage you to talk to them

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,960
meet to

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,280
meet with them and help help support

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,160
them

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,440
and maybe also jump into the projects

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,599
yourselves

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,560
so with that in mind again i welcome you

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,760
all to

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,720
this year's o nes 2020

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:46,000
and i hope you all have a fantastic time

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:48,960
thank you very much

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,359
thank you tom uh like your idea and you

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,440
know

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,040
call to participate specifically for

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,560
developers and projects so

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,240
absolutely an important concept uh

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,960
i would like to add one thing on the

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,720
kernel networking side of things

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,960
for those of you who are not familiar

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,200
with a project called dent

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,079
that was launched earlier this year it's

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,400
a nas

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,720
which really builds on the kernel native

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,200
networking right so it's using switchdev

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,000
and it's used for you know retail losses

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,960
and uh

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,760
data center type nos and this is really

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,119
think of it

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,960
as requiring no abstractions like

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,119
you know you keep on abstracting and

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,720
then you lose performance and increase

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,359
cost so this is like the

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,280
you know native way of doing uh now so i

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,480
i just want to add one thing there

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,040
uh but let's move on uh the next uh

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,839
speaker is again well-known uh thought

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,040
leader

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:45,440
uh from uh intel rajesh khadir

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,400
he's the vp of data platforms group in

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,200
cto

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,560
so without any further ado let's have

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,630
rajesh she's going to talk about the

00:39:50,560 --> 00:40:01,189
edge as well

00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:01,189
[Music]

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,040
hello everyone my name is rajesh gadir

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,359
and i'm the vice president and cto for

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,720
intel's networking business it's a real

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,079
pleasure to be talking to you

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,720
at this on es event today

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,440
2020 has been a very eventful year so

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,280
far

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,640
i hope all of you are staying safe and

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,079
doing well in the middle of this

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,240
pandemic

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,920
things seem to be improving recently so

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,920
i'm hopeful that we will return to

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,960
normal operations soon and i hope to see

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,480
you all in person

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,319
at the next one yes event 2020 has also

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,920
been the year of 5g

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,920
the foundation we have made as a

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,920
community over the last few years in

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,400
virtualizing the network infrastructure

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,760
and the 5g field trials we have led over

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,440
the last couple of years

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,599
have prepared us really well for the

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,000
rollout of 5g services

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,880
now a key inflection point for us is the

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,119
transition to

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,520
cloud native approaches to build and

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,440
deploy network applications

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,119
the disaggregation of hardware and

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,119
software with nfb

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,760
positions us really well for cloud

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,160
native an approach that was pioneered by

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,520
cloud service providers and now is being

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,119
increasingly adopted in the network

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,920
infrastructure

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,000
in the cloud native model network and

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,640
edge services are built as micro

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,040
services

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,839
to deliver better scalability agility

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,960
and faster innovation

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,079
i am going to focus on the edge as a key

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,599
business opportunity

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:30,400
fueled by 5g this picture here

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,800
shows the key drivers of edge computing

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,560
the

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,400
next generation of services such as

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,200
industrial and factory automation

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,520
particularly ai driven automation video

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,839
and video analytics related services

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,960
uh private wireless in the enterprises

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,520
all require

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,319
low latency determinism end-to-end

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,880
security

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,040
and quality of service now this can only

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,520
be achieved if the computing is done

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,079
closer to the application or service and

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,160
this is exactly what an edge delivers

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,839
one way to think about it is bringing

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,520
the cloud computing to where the

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,800
application is and where the data

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,400
resides

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,000
the virtualization of network

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,280
infrastructure and the standard

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,599
server-like infrastructure

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,359
in the wireless radio access networks

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,520
and telco central offices

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,240
also open up the possibility to do edge

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,319
computing at these locations now some

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,440
examples are content delivery networks

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,160
or cdns

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,280
and cloud gaming where you could host a

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,839
gpu cloud

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,079
closer to the consumers now another

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,640
option is to deploy edge microservices

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,599
in telco regional clouds or even public

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,920
clouds

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,240
applications that are not highly latency

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,720
sensitive can run in these clouds

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,480
in fact the cloud native deployment

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,359
architecture with microservices

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,960
allows us the possibility to make use of

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,280
any of these locations

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,000
based on the application requirements

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,280
cost

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,040
and other considerations gartner

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,200
predicts that by 2025

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,839
75 percent of data will be generated

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,240
outside the traditional data center of

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,400
cloud

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,240
so the key takeaway therefore here is

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,560
that edge computing is

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,400
really as much about flexibility and

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,079
scalability with which you can schedule

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,200
workloads at various locations in the

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,319
infrastructure

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,160
based on cost latency quality of service

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,480
and a host of other requirements

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,520
location is a consideration for sure but

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,480
in the longer run

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,800
flexibility and scale play a much bigger

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,520
role in edge deployments

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,720
look at the challenges of deploying edge

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,599
applications

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,480
first the diverse nature of applications

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,319
and services

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,400
at the edge require heterogeneous

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,359
computing resources such as ai

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,960
accelerators

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,760
gpus smart mix second

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,760
the edge needs to be dynamic and built

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,920
with cloud native practices

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,359
why so we can respond to the dynamic

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,200
nature of today's applications and

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:52,319
services

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,920
third the edge needs to support key

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,760
performance latency and quality of

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,000
service like i said before

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,680
and the needs of these new age

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,359
applications and services

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,200
many of these applications that run at

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,440
the edge are real-time applications

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,079
and have stringent requirements for

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,720
latency and determinism

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,720
so now let's look at what i believe are

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,119
three key areas that i'm showing

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,640
on this page that help us deliver the

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,520
edge services with the cloud native

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,079
approach

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,400
these are also the areas that intel's

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,599
putting a lot more emphasis on

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,000
first and foremost the infrastructure

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,760
or the hardware for the edge now we have

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,720
driven significant innovations in our

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,880
latest generation

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,400
intel xeon platforms for both network

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,480
and edge applications

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,760
our vision quite simply is to make a

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,440
standard server

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,920
a best-in-class network applications

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,880
platform and deliver a scalable

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,319
programmable and

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,480
intelligent infrastructure for edge

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,319
services in particular

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,240
for edge we have developed a modular

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,079
plug-and-play system architecture called

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,839
converged edge reference architecture or

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,319
serum

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,079
second the application platform and how

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,400
do we provide that easy button

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,119
so what intel's doing here is for we're

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,200
focused on

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,280
providing the software and tools that

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,079
make it easy for application developers

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,920
to build and deploy your applications

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,240
with a cloud native approach

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,560
and to facilitate this we have built an

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,599
edge software stack called openness

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,200
open network edge services software that

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,319
provides a number of our platform

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,160
optimizations

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,760
in the form of microservices with rest

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,400
apis

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,200
third the orchestration and automation

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,880
and the whole

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,640
ci cd the continuous integration

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,720
contains deployment approach to create

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,359
deploy and manage edge applications with

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,200
scale

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,760
now in this area we've been working

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,440
extensively with kubernetes community

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,280
and improving the networking and other

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,480
capabilities in kubernetes for edge

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,400
applications

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,240
now one of our key efforts in kubernetes

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,920
is what we call enhanced platform

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,680
awareness or eta

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,119
this allows us to expose key

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,599
capabilities and

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,319
new features in our hardware platforms

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,560
including

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,480
real-time telemetry data that can be

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,160
used by kubernetes controllers

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,680
such as placement controllers to place

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,599
workloads with intelligence

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,119
for best performance performance for

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,119
what considerations

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,440
next i want to zoom in and spend a

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,119
couple of minutes on openness i

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,960
made a reference to openness earlier the

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,720
open network edge services software

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,720
toolkit created by intel

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,240
in collaboration with many of our

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,480
industry partners

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,000
openness is a modular architecture and

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,000
is intended to provide you

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,079
a software platform with pre-built

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
services to make your job easier as a

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,720
developer of edge applications

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,640
so what does openness give you first it

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,480
abstracts network complexity so you can

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,240
choose across many different data planes

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,079
container network interfaces or cni's

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,480
and access technologies

00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,079
second it provides a number of services

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,240
for cloud native deployments

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,200
in particular it has support for cloud

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,680
native ingredients

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,520
for resource orchestration telemetry and

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,319
service mesh technologies

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,760
openness has built-in micro services for

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,680
data clearance processing like i said

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,520
multi-access networking

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,800
telemetry various kinds of platform

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,240
accelerators

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,000
especially for media and video

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,280
processing application

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,760
security and so openness

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,040
provides many of these optimizations for

00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,280
hardware features

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,800
for best performance and the return on

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,079
investment

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,640
in in many ways this is the easy button

00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,520
for building your edge applications now

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,000
if you're a developer

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,880
looking to build edge services i invite

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,800
you to download openness at openness.org

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,800
and play with it as you begin to use

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,040
openness please reach out to us

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,800
and provide your feedback we would love

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,839
to work with you and continue to enhance

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,240
the capabilities and openness for your

00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,280
needs

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,160
we are assuring in a new era of

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,920
distributed computing we will see many

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,960
innovations and new services in coming

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,920
months

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,040
especially as the 5d ramp happens so i

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,359
really look forward to

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,280
working with the community to drive this

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,280
next phase of innovation

00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,520
stay safe and see you soon thank you so

00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,520
much

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,200
all right thank you rajesh that was

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,000
insightful and i agree

00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,400
you know 75 of the data created is going

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,720
to be outside the data centers right and

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,000
you know foreign said the same thing uh

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,040
you're saying it i think a lot of

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,359
analysts are saying

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,079
edge is kind of four times the market so

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:23,119
really excited

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,800
about this whole phenomenon edge uh

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,680
let's move gears into

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,800
something more deep uh more detailed uh

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,119
in terms of sort of the

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,960
infrastructure side of things and i want

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,000
to introduce

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,280
a couple of key speakers here but before

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,400
i do that let me introduce

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,760
uh you know what they're going to talk

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,000
about i think i mentioned it at my

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,920
keynote it's a new project called

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,200
and it's very exciting times and you

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,480
know we're going to spend a little bit

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,800
more time on

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,599
on sort of understanding what it's going

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,240
to bring to

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,839
uh to the linux foundation and linux

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,880
foundation networking from a telecom

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,680
perspective

00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,720
uh but the next keynote speakers are

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,640
jonas arms

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,839
the chief technologist and martin

00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,440
halston who is the distinguished

00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,559
technologist

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:17,839
at hpe so without any delay

00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:17,839
please welcome jonas and martin

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:28,880
hello there so hi there i'm

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,400
martin halstead um and as was

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,480
previously discussed i'm i'm a

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,400
distinguished technologist uh within

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,400
uh hewlett packard enterprise and my

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,119
primary focus is on

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,839
uh technology within the uh the telco

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,160
domain

00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,960
um so i've been alongside jonas i've

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,760
been working

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,319
on this odum project and an associated

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,440
hpe

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:54,400
product uh that falls out of that

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,839
for well every year now so in this

00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,160
presentation

00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,839
we're going to talk about the the

00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,800
business problem in terms of what does

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:04,400
odum

00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,000
address um what the project approaches

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,359
with uh in terms of the

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,119
the odom community um the the status of

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,440
the odin project

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,520
and then hp's product line uh the

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,720
resource aggregator program

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,520
um you know what what that is and

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,440
um and how would we use it in in terms

00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,280
of go to market

00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:30,319
so um when we talk about odom

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:33,200
odom stands for open distributed

00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,880
infrastructure management and uh what do

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,640
we mean by open distributed

00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,400
infrastructure management um

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,800
we feel that it addresses a number of

00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:44,079
issues that affect primarily

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,200
um telco like use cases but also equally

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,440
could apply

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,800
to enterprises that have very

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,200
distributed

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,359
uh data centers you know with

00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,480
infrastructure that are that are pretty

00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,200
uh heterogeneous so um so there are a

00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,440
number of

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,400
um telco infrastructure management

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,480
challenges

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,440
that we've looked to address with uh

00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,280
with odom

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,240
um and and these consist of you know

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,040
at least four different areas um ranging

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,119
from

00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,119
um increasing numbers of distributed

00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,680
data centers so what do we mean by that

00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,119
you know as

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,960
as network functions are virtualized

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,880
uh within telco environments that's

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,800
typically started from the core data

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,040
centers of the operators

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,319
but as we're now moving um you know and

00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,960
as is a primary

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,960
uh topic for this forum outside of those

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,359
core data centers more to

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,880
uh you know to the edge of the the

00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:41,280
telecom operators

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:43,599
networks in terms of metro um you know

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,559
central offices radio access networks

00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,280
etc

00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,839
x86 based workloads have been placed out

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,119
you know on

00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,640
um enterprise it infrastructure

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,520
you know if effectively each of the

00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,839
points of presence for an operator

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,359
becomes a miniature data center and each

00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,520
one of them are going to have their own

00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,240
sets of infrastructure

00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,520
meaning that you know you exponentially

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,359
scale out

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,880
how you're going to try and manage all

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,920
of those infrastructure points of

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,240
presence

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,319
um so so that's been a you know and it's

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,280
become more and more a major

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:21,280
headache for the operators in terms of

00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,319
that infrastructure as it deplo as it's

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,319
deployed

00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,160
inside those data centers you know those

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,000
points of presence

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,760
typically it's very heterogeneous and

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,680
what do we mean by that well

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,880
the infrastructure that you deploy in an

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,720
edge deployment

00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,480
um particular you know for for areas

00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,440
like a central office or radio access

00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,079
network

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,920
um it it's fundamentally different

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,000
typically from the infrastructure that

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,240
you deploy inside a core data center and

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,319
that's based on a number of factors

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,280
um you know principle one of those is

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:53,680
cost but also things like environmental

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,200
constraints in terms of you know those

00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,760
points of presence further out in the

00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,240
edge

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,359
could be fairly small you know narrow

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,960
depth

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,200
and then the component sets that would

00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,760
be deployed in that infrastructure

00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,359
would be um typically heterogeneous as

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,800
well it would come from a number of

00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,800
vendors

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,559
and when we talk about vendors as well

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,200
obviously you know we as hpe

00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,960
are you know pretty prevalent in those

00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,920
environments in terms of iot

00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,760
infrastructure

00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,680
but also our competitors are there as

00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,960
well so the environments are extremely

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,040
heterogeneous

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,720
but from an operator perspective they

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,559
want to they want to manage

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,079
you know that compute that storage that

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,359
ethernet switch fabrics

00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,839
uh you know using the same tool sets um

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,280
if they possibly can

00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,960
but the thing that we find though is

00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,640
that we've look at those tool sets

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,000
there's typically minimal alignment

00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,839
across them so

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,280
the way that you would manage compute

00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,040
infrastructure

00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,559
is typically very different to how you

00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,160
would manage storage

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:54,720
and networking and and that's based on

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,079
you know numbers of different protocols

00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,760
that are involved

00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,160
data models for managing that

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,440
infrastructure and then vendor specific

00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:07,280
implementations as well so you have this

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,359
um you know mix up of

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,359
you know different protocol sets vendor

00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,280
implementations data models

00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,800
and that make it extremely different

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,119
difficult from an orchestration

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,400
perspective you know service management

00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:23,440
um to to manage that infrastructure

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,760
so the the types of solutions then that

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,079
exists

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,960
to try and manage those infrastructures

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,079
again

00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,160
we find that those are typically closed

00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,280
i.e you know single vendor solutions

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,200
that may manage

00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,960
maybe you know one or two different

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,280
vendors um

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,040
uh compute solutions maybe one or two

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,640
ethernet switch fabrics

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:50,240
the same with um storage nodes but the

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:53,119
um you know the the the management

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,799
life cycle of those um you know of those

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,240
close solutions those um you know

00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:58,960
there's managed

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,359
uh you know per per vendor um you know

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,480
infrastructure management solutions

00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,400
um tends to be you know entirely down to

00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,040
single vendors

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,559
so you know you end up with brittle

00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,599
architectures that

00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,920
become extremely difficult um to scale

00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,040
out

00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,200
and support you know different vendors

00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,079
different protocol sets etc and that

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,040
this this

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,680
kind of leads to a lack of physical

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,839
infrastructure management consistency

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,079
um that's you know particularly

00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,000
prevalent in the telco space so

00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,400
you know as you can see in this diagram

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,400
you have a number of upstream

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,400
cots overseas service resources

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,520
management stacks ranging from you know

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,760
say openstack kubernetes onap etc

00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,520
or even the operating systems themselves

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,880
you know they would need to have bespoke

00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,640
integrations then

00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,480
to various physical infrastructure

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,839
management solutions typically coming

00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,559
from single vendors

00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,920
and those in turns then would have uh

00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,559
you know integration

00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,200
into the physical infrastructure itself

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,640
um you know based on protocol sets like

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:08,400
redfish you know gnmi

00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:11,280
netconf yang and you know vendor pretty

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,520
vendor proprietary um you know data

00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,319
models and and protocol sets so you have

00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,119
these

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,920
you know a mesh of bespoke integrations

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,040
and so

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,680
what we have uh looked at from uh

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,720
um you know an open source an open

00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,040
perspective is

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,000
how can we simplify infrastructure

00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,319
management

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,680
uh and truly make it open so we didn't

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,240
want as a vendor

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,160
um you know as hpe to go and build our

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,599
own infrastructure management stack we

00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,640
wanted to work with the open source

00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,559
community

00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,760
uh which is why we approached the linux

00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,119
foundation

00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:48,000
uh in terms of looking at tool sets

00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,920
that allow for you know truly open

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,359
infrastructure management

00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:56,160
so um so in terms of our approach is a

00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,960
a project for that i'll now hand over to

00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,280
my colleague

00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:02,079
jonas ant that'll take you through the

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,079
odin project

00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,240
yeah hi guys first a little introduction

00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,440
on myself i'm in i'm an architect

00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,319
working for hpe

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,640
the telco segment same team as martin

00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:15,040
doing very similar stuff

00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,839
so martin actually presented a bunch of

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,640
problems

00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,440
and uh we have been looking at those and

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,240
and you know

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,599
our interest is obviously to sell hpe

00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,400
gear and

00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,520
hp products at the same time we realized

00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,839
that if we could

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,720
level the playing field and make sure

00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:33,760
that

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,599
things like operators could use

00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,960
equipment from different vendors it

00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,000
would be a good thing for all

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,559
for the whole industry so we set up

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,559
set out a few objectives when we formed

00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,000
this project uh

00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,480
one of the objectives was obviously that

00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,680
we we want to have like a

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,920
standard align way of of talking to

00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,839
to the stack and and we picked the mtf

00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,440
redfish for that because

00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:00,000
redfish has been around for quite some

00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,559
time it's adopted in the industry

00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,160
and it has evolved and is dealing with a

00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,640
lot of the stuff that we

00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,160
we have been looking at so not only the

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,400
apis on the top

00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,400
but also the model it should be pure

00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,839
redfish and that's one of the principles

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,520
of the project

00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:18,000
other things that we wanted to do is

00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,839
that we we want to make sure that

00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,480
northbound clients didn't have to worry

00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,520
about vendor-specific implementations so

00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,920
that's another

00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,720
key thing and we also wanted to be able

00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,280
to

00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,119
just hit this stack and know about

00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,920
everything going on in the data center

00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,559
so we wanted

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,559
we wanted some sort of an aggregation

00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,280
and we very early started talking to the

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,520
dnpf

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:44,240
uh redfish standard body about

00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,640
introducing uh extra things that will

00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,319
allow

00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,640
support for that so you can hit the

00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:51,520
northbound interfaces and understand

00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,319
exactly what's in the in the data center

00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,559
where it sits

00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:57,119
in what rack what aisle and and what it

00:58:54,559 --> 00:59:00,319
is and so on and so forth

00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,040
so once we started looking at this a

00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,599
little bit more

00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,079
inside hpe we started coding a little

00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,839
bit

00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,200
before it became open source but we

00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:09,839
always did that with

00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,599
with the mind that we will actually open

00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,040
source this and we would do it together

00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,040
with partners

00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,720
so looking at the bigger picture here on

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,000
the top then you could have a bunch of

00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,359
different type of clients

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,520
that will actually be able to

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:25,359
communicate with the stack

00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:27,520
using standard redfish api calls

00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,720
and expect then that the redfish model

00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,880
that is presented

00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,000
is also aligned with the standard on the

00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,319
southbound side like

00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,760
martin was pointing out we have a lot of

00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:39,440
different protocols

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:42,559
there are bmc's that speak ipmi

00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,240
redfish different versions of redfish

00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,160
depending on what vendor it comes from

00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,079
perhaps different versions of redfish

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,799
even if there are two different

00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,720
server models from the same vendor so

00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:55,920
all of these things we wanted to

00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,640
that has made it very difficult to to do

00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,520
standard implementation automation we

00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,559
wanted to

00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,160
sort of try to remove from the equation

01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,599
so that's why you see on the southbound

01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,839
side that we have some

01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,880
some different type of equipment and

01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,760
different type of

01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,280
protocols so if we take that a step

01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,319
further then and look at

01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,480
how the odium stack looks like today you

01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:21,520
can then see that on the northbound side

01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,160
we have these type of redfish

01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,079
apis there is also a box here saying

01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,599
integration and that's

01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:32,799
if the northbound client does not speak

01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,040
redfish there is a obviously a need to

01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,359
do

01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,040
translations and things of that nature

01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,559
on the southbound side

01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,400
you can see that we have something

01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,319
called the odium resource

01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,480
abstraction layer and this is what we

01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:45,359
refer to internally at hbs the plugin

01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,559
layer

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,760
and it will allow a vendor or some

01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,440
contributor

01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,839
to develop a plugin that will translate

01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,440
from

01:00:53,839 --> 01:01:00,000
their server switch or what have you

01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,200
into this redfish model so for instance

01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,520
if you're a vendor and you

01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,520
have a server that speaks redfish but

01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,280
perhaps it's an older version of redfish

01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,640
your your plugin can then do

01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,319
translations from

01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,680
from that older version to the newer

01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:13,839
version

01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,040
all all plugins will also actually have

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:17,520
a leg on a

01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,160
on an event bus being able to forward

01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,960
events

01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,359
up to the stack because in the stack we

01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,359
have

01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:25,920
the event service that northbound

01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:27,359
clients tank could subscribe to

01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,880
looking at the stack here you see there

01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:30,000
is a lot of different services and

01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,839
they're all eight uh

01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,359
redfish services there's the account

01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,359
service the event service

01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,640
aggregation services uh is a late

01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,839
contribution in the

01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,680
redfish spec 2020.2

01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,599
uh part of that is something we have

01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,720
worked on together with the partners in

01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,079
dmtf

01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:51,200
uh like intel and others

01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,599
so um next slide just

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,799
then how would does this look in in the

01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,520
ecosystem then

01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:59,359
so obviously in the project we will have

01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,240
we will have hardware vendors we will

01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,520
have

01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,599
operators and orchestration vendors and

01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,720
and and others and we will all work

01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,799
together to

01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,079
to to weasel in the features we are

01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:12,240
looking for

01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,599
and while doing that we will also run

01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,240
into shortcomings

01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,079
of things like the spec so we have

01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,559
obviously a relationship with

01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,119
redfish and and we try to influence them

01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,319
to

01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,960
to implement things that we feel we

01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:28,880
the industry needs in the future and and

01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,119
sometimes that is uh

01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,079
easy to do sometimes it it takes a while

01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,799
right

01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,880
also we have other projects that could

01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:39,920
consume odin like cntt

01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,760
ownapp and cncf and others that will

01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,920
also have some requirements so it's

01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,880
important for us to understand those and

01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,720
see if we can

01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,839
satisfy those while making changes to

01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,839
stack right

01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,480
then a little bit on where we are in the

01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:57,440
project it's it's a fairly new project

01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,000
we've it's formed in in june i think and

01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,920
it's an

01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,760
unfunded project what that means is that

01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,799
we're hanging straight off ls

01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,440
we don't have an umbrella community that

01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:08,400
we are

01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,480
a part of right now that has some

01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,240
disadvantages and some advantages

01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,000
for instance you don't have to pay any

01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,280
membership to to join

01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,039
as long as you're part of linux

01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,119
foundation uh

01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,760
at some point in the future we will take

01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:24,160
a decision if we will fall into

01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,680
some umbrella organization or what we

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,799
will do right

01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,960
we have a psc formed already and we have

01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:33,520
meetings every wednesday it's 9am at

01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,839
mountain time so anybody can dial in

01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:38,319
to just participate it's open for for

01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,319
the public

01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,799
just looking a little bit at the

01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,400
contribution that we did when we formed

01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,359
a project so obviously there were some

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,160
seed code that went

01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:49,520
in and dark blue things here is

01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,640
representing what hp

01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,119
contributed obviously we set up

01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,160
some of the services here as you can see

01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,039
and the model

01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,440
and we also contributed a plug-in a

01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,240
generic redfish plug-in that anybody can

01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,799
use

01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,160
for redfish equipment or as a template

01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,319
to develop

01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,280
your own plug-in for for your specific

01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,599
equipment

01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,200
there's also pending contributions here

01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,280
ami is looking at this

01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,559
contributing composition and we know

01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,000
intel is working on

01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:23,280
a plug-in for unmanaged racks

01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,720
okay then

01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,480
what are we doing right now in the

01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:29,520
status the project is formed

01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,039
ts tsc is up and running and we have the

01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,079
company we have the contributor code

01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,440
like i mentioned

01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,200
we're waiting for some other

01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,760
contributions as well

01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,599
we have a website open that you can hit

01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,559
it's odin.io there from there you can

01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,559
get to the wiki

01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,480
and you can see the meetings going on

01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,640
and we have a mailing list as well

01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,760
and github obviously you can download

01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,880
the code and

01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,960
anything hpe and others are doing now

01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,799
to enhance this further is all in the

01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,319
open so when there are features created

01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,240
you will see feature branches and you

01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,920
will see uh pull requests and all this

01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,000
type of stuff

01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,839
so with that i i think i hand back to

01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,680
martin to go over a little bit uh

01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:10,799
the offerings that hpe has in this space

01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:13,520
right yeah thanks jonas so

01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:14,960
um so that just this next section it

01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:18,400
will cover off then

01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:21,520
um a product line that we have um

01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,119
which is basically our distribution of

01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:26,319
the um the odom

01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,240
project uh in terms of what we call hp's

01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:31,440
resource aggregated product

01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:34,960
so so this is part of um an overall

01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,760
hp telco value proposition so we as hpe

01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,880
as

01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,599
you know as i guess the majority um

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,559
uh within the industry would appreciate

01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,280
have been in the

01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,240
the telecom space for an awful long time

01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,200
and have been in

01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,079
um areas like an nfv network function by

01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,359
virtualization

01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,440
since the beginning and you know the

01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,000
formation of that so

01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,480
um you know as part of that in terms of

01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,839
you know deploying industry standard

01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:05,280
um you know i t infrastructure

01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,680
in the telecoms environment we we do a

01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,000
whole

01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,000
a bunch of work in terms of things like

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,720
telco compliance for os and driver

01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,559
tuning

01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:18,079
we produce blueprints of compute storage

01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:20,000
and an ethernet switch fabrics for

01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,680
um for various parts of a telecom

01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,039
operator's environment

01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,640
we have infrastructure tools kits um you

01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,599
know go to market propositions with

01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,000
something like hp

01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,920
green link but also as part of that then

01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,960
we will have a distribution our own

01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,160
distribution

01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,480
of odom um and so

01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,680
that distribution of odin would become

01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,720
essentially part

01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,599
of our telco blueprint evolution so we

01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,559
have a number of

01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,720
uh blueprints which are which are made

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,839
up of hp infrastructure as

01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:54,799
um you know as example

01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:56,400
um models of how you would build um you

01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:58,960
know fully validated

01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,400
uh nfvi stacks for a telecoms

01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,920
environment

01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,240
and as part of that in terms of the

01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,760
automation of that infrastructure we

01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,480
want to ensure that it's fully open

01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,920
so so those blueprints cover core and

01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:13,359
edge deployments

01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,920
and then in future core and edge

01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:17,039
models each one of them would have an

01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,640
odom

01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,680
resource aggregator um deployed as part

01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,799
of that

01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:27,920
so what we end up with then

01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:32,480
is a framework for

01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:35,520
hp's open quarter edge 5g infrastructure

01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:38,319
and that consists of you know obviously

01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,760
the infrastructure that we have as hpe

01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,920
as well as the

01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,319
you know supporting management toolsets

01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,839
which are completely industry standard

01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:48,799
and fully open

01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,599
um and sitting above that then you know

01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,160
we would

01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:54,640
form partnerships in terms of areas like

01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:57,280
composition management and monitoring

01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,640
we have a couple on the slide there in

01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,440
terms of open sources

01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,039
as well as with companies like ami

01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,839
american mega trends

01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,680
uh but then also layering on top of that

01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,680
you know various partnerships

01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,039
for virtual infrastructure management

01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,480
sdn solutions

01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,400
and then obviously the virtualized

01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,000
network functions themselves which would

01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,520
come from the major network equipment

01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,560
providers

01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,839
as well as the isvs

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,960
that exist within the telecoms

01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:27,040
environment

01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,279
so um so hopefully that gives you a good

01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:32,880
overview of the odin project

01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:33,520
and hp's offerings uh in that space as

01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,279
well

01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:39,839
so i'll hand back now to uh to the

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,839
moderator thank you

01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,520
all right thank you so we are in the

01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,359
final keynote and on

01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,679
uh on a home stretch okay sorry

01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,440
stretch at home everybody i shouldn't

01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,080
have used that word but that's what we

01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,600
are

01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:12,799
uh so let's go ahead and i will uh walk

01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,400
you through

01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:17,279
uh my thoughts on where the next three

01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:22,319
years are going

01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:27,060
okay alrighty

01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:28,159
oops that is

01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:35,839
[Music]

01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:35,839
alrighty where's the slides

01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:43,920
i'm sorry i will uh

01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:46,719
there you go again

01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,839
we are in california i don't see any

01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:52,319
earthquakes here but uh

01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:53,920
let's see that should come up well at

01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,360
least we are showing that this is live

01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:00,080
so that's good

01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:03,920
uh let me start off by saying that um

01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:05,600
in the in the next 10 minutes and i

01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,840
wouldn't bore you to detail

01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,600
uh what's happened is uh you know if

01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,960
you've seen a whole bunch

01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:16,159
of uh good solutions

01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,120
good open projects and good ecosystems

01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:19,760
coming up

01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,800
and i want to emphasize where we are

01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,920
going to head

01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:27,199
in the next you know three years so

01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,920
let me let me uh open it here locally

01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,520
and see

01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,199
where we should be going and i think the

01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,719
slides will come up you will always get

01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:36,560
a copy of these slides as we

01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:38,000
move forward let's let's go ahead

01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,000
uh so the first thing i want to

01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,320
emphasize is uh

01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,600
that in terms of 2020 priorities we have

01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:49,840
three

01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:52,320
and here you go perfect thank you

01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,360
all right so perfect no time lost the

01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,000
first one is

01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,760
there's a seamless telecom and cloud

01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,960
integration going on and it's at your

01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,120
fingertips

01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,640
right so you we need to realize this and

01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,080
it's a very important thing so let me

01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,360
show you how it's going to happen

01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,920
with google joining with uh microsoft uh

01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,199
you know

01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,600
major participation in in lf networking

01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,560
how does this vision get realized and if

01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,800
you look at

01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,320
the simple diagram i showed it even

01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,560
becomes even more simpler

01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,480
all right uh you know with the oran the

01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,880
ukraine on the left hand side but

01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,880
in the core all of a sudden you know the

01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,679
carrier call the public cloud private

01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,920
cloud

01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:34,400
all of that becomes a very simple stack

01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,719
and that stack if you start from the top

01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,400
you have your applications be an fcnf or

01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:41,920
any other cloud native application

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,199
sort of standardized osspss manual type

01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,400
layer with analytics

01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:48,400
uh coming to a controller uh with uh

01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,400
you know uh via vm based you know

01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,400
openstack running on kubernetes

01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,000
which becomes the infrastructure layer

01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,760
choose your uh

01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,239
database plain acceleration of your

01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,920
choice you know fido dpdk etc there's a

01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:02,560
lot a lot of options there

01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,000
and then you know integration with uh

01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,960
public cloud players like

01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,719
you know azure and and google et cetera

01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,159
uh and again this is not exclusive to

01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,040
these folks i'm just giving you one

01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,960
example here

01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:15,199
uh there are plenty of public clouds you

01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,679
know including uh vendors and

01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,719
uh operators that have offered this so

01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,520
this is kind of

01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,080
a very simple uh cloud plus telecom

01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,320
vision

01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,920
enabled by open source collaboration so

01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:29,679
if i kind of double click this

01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,800
a little bit the integration points

01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,440
become even

01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,400
more simpler right you have the

01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,320
northbound

01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,480
which is all standard base so this is

01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,800
the oss bsse services right

01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,040
mef and tm forum have done years of work

01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,199
there and all those apis have been

01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,719
coded up in onap already in the external

01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,480
api project so

01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,080
keep that existing infrastructure and

01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:53,199
keep in mind this is brownfield

01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,120
deployments you know i always joke right

01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,480
uh there's very few green peel

01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,159
deployments and

01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,400
the moment you deploy your first green

01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:02,880
field it becomes brownfield

01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,159
so be aware of of all the uh the hype

01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,719
around greenfield but

01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,840
here's the reality you know 99 of the

01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:10,159
deployments will be

01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,920
will be brownfield on the left-hand side

01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:12,719
in terms of you know designing the

01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,040
network right

01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,960
standardized to etsy and mech

01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:20,159
descriptors right packaging

01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,560
um onboarding uh heat tusk

01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:24,159
yang you know templates etc and on the

01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,360
southbound side obviously

01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:30,000
you know a huge huge focus on etsy salts

01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:33,360
gsma 3gpp etc

01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,120
and then those things running on mthos

01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,400
if you take google as an example and you

01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,840
know the collaboration of that

01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,640
with under the linux foundation

01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:43,840
networking end-to-end testing by

01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:47,600
uh you know opnfv and the cntt merged

01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,480
entities so clearly a great set of

01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,600
solutions

01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,000
now exist and what we need to understand

01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,280
is

01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,000
how do these solutions kind of

01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:59,199
go and deploy themselves in more of a

01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,360
use case manner

01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,679
right you heard our keynote speakers

01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,920
today and you saw them

01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,800
talking about use cases so let me talk

01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,560
about how

01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,640
some of the most important use cases

01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,400
that are driving open networking

01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,040
so in networking uh you see the projects

01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,679
here

01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:20,320
um you can see oran for example the

01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:23,520
focus of oran yes while it's an alliance

01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:25,520
the software portion called oran sc

01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,880
as hosted by linux foundation is

01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:30,800
focusing on use cases in 5g

01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,920
end-to-end network slicing quality of

01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,760
experience optimization white boxes etc

01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,440
if you look at the core and cloud which

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,600
is kind of the blue color here

01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:44,159
uh onap's use case focuses on slicing 5g

01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,360
obviously across cloud vpn zero touch

01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:47,920
closed loop automation

01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,760
volte vims vcp et cetera and nomadic

01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,920
broadband

01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,760
we have talked a lot about the merged

01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,920
project or pnfec and tt

01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,360
all standardization and then obviously

01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,960
kubernetes has that underlying

01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,480
multi-cloud hybrid layer

01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:05,280
so very exciting use cases that are uh

01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:06,800
being deployed as part of these projects

01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,239
and as far as said right like the lego

01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,719
blocks are coming together in

01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,440
in these use cases if you look at the

01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,719
edge

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:16,880
the edge is even you know getting more

01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,840
harmonized and more unified right so you

01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,239
start off with that

01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,679
sort of the device edge uh things like

01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,480
anomaly detection things like

01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,679
surveillance

01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,000
things like on-prem devops at scale

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,480
right

01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,920
if you're talking the project eve or if

01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:32,640
you're talking

01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,239
iiot things like predictive maintenance

01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:37,840
and condition based monitoring for

01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:39,440
turbines transformers pumps etc

01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,520
and then of course uh you know

01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,480
integration with aiml

01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,960
things like tensorflow coming in right

01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,360
or

01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,440
maybe look at iot frameworks right

01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,440
abstracting the iot

01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,480
from lifecycle management through

01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,080
microservices

01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,600
things like building automation

01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,719
industrial process control

01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,159
smart cities water retail etc and then

01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,000
of course if you're talking the service

01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,880
provider edge which is in purple here

01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,440
you're talking

01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,000
blueprints and use cases like the radio

01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,239
edge cloud

01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,120
the telco clouds the connected vehicles

01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:12,960
ar vr

01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:15,520
classrooms uh enterprise automation

01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,840
even private lte services which are very

01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,360
very critical this this year and next

01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,880
and then the public cloud edge

01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,360
interfaces so

01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,719
lots of good excitement exciting use

01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,719
cases are being driven

01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,400
and we want to make sure that the teams

01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:31,120
focus on and we

01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,000
accelerate the projects to production

01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,159
cycle

01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,440
and then the final thing that brings

01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:38,560
everything together

01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,800
is networking and edge are enabling a

01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,080
whole set of vertical industries right i

01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,840
i opened one es with this keynote

01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,199
uh and this white paper that we have

01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,360
published but

01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,400
this is not the ending this is the

01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,440
beginning

01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,840
telecom and automotive they are

01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,800
working together to bring you the best

01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:02,400
of low latency connectivity with 5g with

01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,800
autonomous driving and vehicle 2x

01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,760
motion pictures with all these visual

01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,800
effects that

01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,920
come in uh which are software based they

01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,520
are not only running

01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,520
through the network but now they're

01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,719
running at the edge of the network with

01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:20,159
virtual shootings and virtual

01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:22,960
effect processing right energy

01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:24,640
energy sector is really where telecom

01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,719
was five years ago

01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,320
they are at the beginning of this open

01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,280
source revolution where

01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,600
the exact same orchestration

01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:35,360
containerization

01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:37,199
uh needs to happen um at at the grids

01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,520
at the edges of the grid so the core

01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:41,520
distribution sites etc

01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,199
and they are working on you know again

01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,159
cyber security from an open source

01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:46,159
perspective so

01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:48,239
very very powerful energy uh

01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:50,719
distribution financial i don't need to

01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:54,320
even talk about that i mean we all know

01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:57,920
that networks are the underlying

01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,120
uh underlying frameworks for financial

01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,800
and then of course the latest

01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,560
is the public health and all the apps

01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,840
that are running through so

01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:09,120
high level uh story here is edge

01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,760
and networking are fundamental building

01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,440
blocks

01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:15,040
of vertical industries and we need to

01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,040
just continue promoting them

01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:20,239
so to wrap up today and uh you know the

01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,080
keynote sections

01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:24,000
i have my observation obviously i'm

01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,560
going to keep it to five

01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,239
but the five observations that i'm sure

01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,840
you all agree with me

01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:31,440
uh that you know we're listening to the

01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,480
keynotes in the session

01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,800
um number one

01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,880
network is even more important in the

01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,679
new world you heard andre you heard

01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,520
alex you heard justin you know it's not

01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:45,280
just the ats and the equinix and the

01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,960
deutsche telecoms but you've heard

01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:51,199
so many operators talk at the conference

01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,000
network is even more important in the

01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:55,360
new world

01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,360
so please participate in in this

01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,199
project because it's all being built on

01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:03,199
open source

01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:05,440
second 5g cloud ai edge and iot they are

01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:07,280
key and they are technologies but as

01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,239
i've always said technologies come and

01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,640
go

01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:13,840
if you remember in the last 30 years we

01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:16,000
fed we fought protocol wars we fought

01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,520
technology wars but that's no longer the

01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,080
case right you built

01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,120
build these build solutions build things

01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,199
that are value

01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,040
so these are key in building the next

01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:27,199
generation of solutions

01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,960
what i'm most excited about is that

01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:30,880
markets are collaborating

01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,480
right versus competing you've heard it

01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:37,120
from so many of our

01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:40,400
uh ecosystem players this really really

01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:42,080
you know brings out too many options i

01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,120
would say for the enterprises right

01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:45,360
because now

01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,960
if you look at end users whether it's

01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,280
enterprises governments

01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,400
countries they have a vast array of

01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,960
options

01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,719
using quote what i call the plumbing

01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,480
layer or the infrastructure layer which

01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,320
is all open source space and now

01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,520
all of a sudden they have the cloud-like

01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,960
connectivity

01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:05,360
um latency and storage right at their

01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,000
fingertips so very important for end

01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,400
users

01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,280
and i think we've heard from so many of

01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,000
the vertical

01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,719
end users in the conference and we'll

01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,840
hear more

01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:17,040
in the coming months as well and not to

01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,120
say the least

01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,280
collaboration is the way to go open

01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:24,719
source collaboration is the way to go

01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:27,040
uh you know we can't emphasize it one

01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,880
company one vendor one operator one

01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,760
system integrator cannot do it

01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,520
themselves

01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,159
you know in terms of dollars in terms of

01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:36,320
time to market as well as in terms to

01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:37,760
of making it completely secure and

01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,679
making money

01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:47,840
right and i'll get you i'll leave you

01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:47,840
with a dirty secret which

01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,880
[Music]

01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,840
participate

01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,440
we lost your audio here but that's fine

01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:25,360
uh

01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:28,080
i think i was talking about a secret

01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:32,320
here uh if you can hear me again

01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:34,960
uh what i was saying is uh all right

01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,960
man you you muted me when i was like

01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,400
talking about a secret so all the people

01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,520
who have stayed with me

01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,080
uh okay i'm gonna repeat it uh so the

01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,520
secret

01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:48,719
here is that that vendors

01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:51,199
system integrators and members and

01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:54,320
you know operators who have participated

01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:56,480
in the open source phenomena

01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,440
they have received an unfair share of

01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,280
the deals

01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:04,159
uh in 5g and beyond okay so

01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,199
keep keep participating keep uh

01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:07,920
supporting

01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:08,960
and with that it's a wrap for me a

01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,360
couple of quick

01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,560
two quick two key updates one is this

01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,520

been reached

01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,800
uh you know while we we in a virtual

01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,239
world there's no room capacity there's a

01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,280
limit to the number of bridges and

01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,960
things like that so

01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,480

our first virtual open networking edit

01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,719
summit which

01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,080
