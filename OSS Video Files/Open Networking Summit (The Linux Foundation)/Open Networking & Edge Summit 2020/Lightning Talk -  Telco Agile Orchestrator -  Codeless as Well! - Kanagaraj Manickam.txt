hi my name is kanagaraj and i am going

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,440
to talk about this telco agile

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,440
orchestrator in this session

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,359
in onap cla project there is a platform

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,920
called open command platform

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
it is introduced to orchestrate or

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,279
automate the different actions

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,279
involved in the owner

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,320
so it enables to model the given action

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,960
as the normal

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
as well as we can capture the execution

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,440
details

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
in the normal that's we can call this

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,360
codeless also we can

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,079
associate the action with the actual

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,360
implementation of that if it could be a

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,960
scripting language or

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,360
programming language it allows to

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,640
onboard and manage those actions and

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,559
while executing

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,719
we can troubleshoot those actions

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,199
footprints

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,199
it also allows to model the environment

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,879
using the yamaha which is called

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,080
uh environment profile at the same time

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,799
it enables to

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,200
orchestrate across the different domains

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,720
or

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,200
on the tools uh it's called as a plugin

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
profile

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,400
so um open command platform is built

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,400
uh with a specification called open

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
command specification which is currently

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,640
used in this platform

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,200
this specification helps to model the

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
action

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
like with what are the required inputs

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,040
or other outputs

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,200
and how the execution is performed so

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,240
all those related informations

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
are captured in this um yaml and that

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,520
yaml

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,720
is completely processed and then

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,119
converted into

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
an action or a command by this model

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,439
engine

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,360
it it enables grpc

00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,640
and um command console or the linux

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
shell so through which we can onboard

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,520
the

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,640
um actions we can manage the action can

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,119
achieve the actions

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,039
so all these operations can be performed

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,520
so for the

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,400
programmatic integration we can use the

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
grpc

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,680
while scripting integration we can use

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,280
the the self command

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
on the other side um it enables to

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
come up with different profiles for

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,920
supporting different environment or

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
protocol specific things like http or

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,400
snmp

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,120
or um we can even integrate the robot

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
which is

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,959
currently we are trying as part of the

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,840
release

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,680
so on one side it enables to integrate

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,000
in the programmatic or scripting

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,360
approach on other side it enables to

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,319
integrate with a different

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,280
environment through the profile so the

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,720
environment

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,879
can be a specific product like one app

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,280
or it can be orchestrated like on a ps4

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,159
or like open stack heat so all those

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
things can be

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,720
integrated seamlessly into this platform

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,000
so one side we are

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,800
it allows to um allow us to integrate

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,519
with a different

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
environment on the other side it enables

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,040
to access them

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,319
seamlessly so it's built on top of

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,800
the domain model um so one so it has a

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,360
product

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,120
under the product usually a product will

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
have service service we have list of

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
features

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,319
so the feature is more or less like a

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,400
command with a required input and output

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
under the environment is modeled with

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
the profile profile basically captures

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,640
all the environment details

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,640
like it could be any the connection

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
details or the current skills

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
which are the information required in

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,959
order to operate those

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,519
environment from this uh platform and

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,400
another is

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,560
artifact it helps to store the um the

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,159
required artifacts like the scripting or

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,239
the configurations

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,400
uh etc the even the environment

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,280
variables and then it can be used

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,360
during the execution so the execution is

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
model using the runtime

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,640
model so in which there are three models

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,680
execution execution takes the command

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,400
uh the instance and then

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,519
the user will give the input uh as the

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,239
parameter

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,000
and with that parameter the execution

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,680
will happens and then finally it's

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,400
produced the result the result is

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,520
nothing but the instance of the output

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,199
so while execution the um the user can

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
also provide the profile which is

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
nothing but the environment details on

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,479
the artifact which is required for

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,479
executing the given actions

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,479
so using this platform we have already

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,759
completed only use case in the one up

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,960
called um

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,400
uh ovp vnf test platform in which

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,600
uh we have done the entry end

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
uh service automations so what we have

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
done

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
um we have taken all the on up actions

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,080
as the

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,199
the command and then expose like the the

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,080
clas

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,039
and the same commands or um consume like

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,199
the test cases

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:12,400
in the vtp so uh one side the action is

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,479
a scene um seen like a command

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
from the devops point of view on other

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,000
side the same action is seen as the test

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
case from the

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,039
testing or the certification point of

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
view

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,440
so it's like develop the action once and

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,800
then use it across the

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,520
the devops cacd or the real production

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280
environment

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,400
so it says um the um development effort

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,120
involved in

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
multiple places otherwise which is the

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
common practice

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,440
today so when you're looking at this

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
uh the picture the vnf life cycle

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
validation

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,400
is made up of this complex uh the the

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
workflow

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,320
shown here so the complete workflow is

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
orchestrated

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,840
through this on the platform uh

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,759
so it acts like a twin one for the

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,560
tester it fills uh

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
the the the user role in the options of

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,199
the user

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,319
and for the user it got from the box as

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
because it's already

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,639
tested from the testing point of view so

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,120
uh so in summary it basically helps to

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,360
model

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
any accents as the yaml and onboard into

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,880
the uh

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
com so from that point of view it will

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,319
be seamlessly

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,199
seen like one action either given on

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,880
grpc

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:32,080
or the uh the cli or or um

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,880
the test case so the same action is

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,479
seen with a different interface but end

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,350
of the day it is going to be the same

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,680
actions

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,520
[Music]

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,960
so more details about this the

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,800
automation what we have done the

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,440
end-to-end things we have given in this

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,759
wiki

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,800
please refer this wiki for more

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,479
information

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,800
so that's all about this orchestrator

00:06:52,479 --> 00:07:03,840
thank you for seeing this watching this

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:03,840
session thank you

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,199
we have now activated the phone bridge

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
unfortunately uh our speaker is online

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,479
but unable to

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,479
access the audio so if you have any

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,160
questions feel free to enter them in the

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,960
q and a with speakers air

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,319
chat and he will respond to you in that

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,319
chat

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
we have a few minutes left if there's

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,240
any questions that don't get answered

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,520
then we will refer you to a slack

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,520
channel where you continue the

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
conversation

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,920
