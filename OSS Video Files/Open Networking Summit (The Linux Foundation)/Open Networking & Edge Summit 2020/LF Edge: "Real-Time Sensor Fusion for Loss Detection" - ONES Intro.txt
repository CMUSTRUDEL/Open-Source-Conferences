hi everyone and welcome to the demo

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,560
presented by

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,880
hp intel and io tech in this demo

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
we showcase logs prevention use case at

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,040
a retail self-checkout

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,880
what this demo does is it shows a

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,880
real-time sensor fusion

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,560
and that sensor fusion is powered by a

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,359
seamless data injection

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,840
by the edgex framework and we create xml

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,920
insights right there on site at the edge

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,920
