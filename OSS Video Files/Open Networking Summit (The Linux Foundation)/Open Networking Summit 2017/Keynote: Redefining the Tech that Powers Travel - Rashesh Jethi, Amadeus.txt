	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,400
so 100 years ago my grandfather was born

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:09,929
in a little town called hood very close

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,000
to the india-pakistan border except 100

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,969
years ago there was no India there was

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,830
no Pakistan it was all part of her

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:21,090
Majesty's British Empire when he was 17

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,359
my grandfather decided he wanted to

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,880
become a lawyer but the nearest law

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,320
university was in a town called Kola for

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,530
a whopping 760 miles away so when he

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,620
left for college my grandfather took a

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,219
camel cart to the nearest coastal town

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,379
of Kandla

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:45,989
and yes don't believe everything you

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,180
read on Wikipedia and what your desi

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,530
friends tell you Indians do travel on

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:56,190
camels not just on elephants from Kerala

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,920
he took a steamship to the fishing

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,289
hamlet of Mumbai where he went to the

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,170
Victoria Terminus train station and took

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,810
a train to Kolhapur the journey of seven

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,200
hundred and sixty miles took three days

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,390
and I know what you're saying to

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,280
yourself that's all very interesting

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,400
what does that have to do with Software

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,939
Defined Networking software-defined data

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:25,049
centers anything and it has everything

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:29,060
to do with it because 100 years later my

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,259
grandfather's favorite grandson I

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,729
checked there's nobody in my family in

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:39,119
the audience I traveled 2700 miles from

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:42,329
Boston to San Francisco and I did it in

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:48,360
six hours and that's not all I checked

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:50,909
in for my flight on my watch the

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,579
industry that you and I are privileged

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,799
to be a part of the technology industry

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,649
absolutely is going through a period of

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,299
incredible change and the industry that

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,990
I'm privileged to serve in my current

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,290
role the travel industry is no different

00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:09,360
think about it we get in a car with a

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,970
stranger who takes us to another

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,640
strangers house where we spend the night

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,530
and we call it not Spring Break in

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,950
college what we call it the sharing

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,970
economy we very little computers on our

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,380
wrists and carry them in our pockets and

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,850
they're always connected transmitting

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,510
information somewhere we call it the

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,250
Internet of Things and regardless of

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,950
where you get your news whether you

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,500
watch the real news or the fake news I'm

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,860
not judging here you know we live in a

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,860
very interesting and very dynamic

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,150
geopolitical landscape so what I'll

00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,820
bring to you over the next few minutes

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,940
is who is Amadeus who are V what do we

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,120
do how do we serve the travel industry

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,350
and then how do we use technology

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,400
including software-defined networking

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:03,190
and data centers to serve our customers

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,200
and travel and to enable millions of

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:09,850
journeys every single day we're actually

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,550
a 30 year old company a lot of you may

00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,440
not have heard of us we are celebrating

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,430
our 30th birthday this year the company

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,730
was started in 1987 with a consortium of

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,370
four European airlines and today we are

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,959
in a hundred and ninety five countries

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,940
so the geography buffs among you that's

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,150
almost as many countries as there

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,480
actually are for the fast food buffs

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,970
that's more countries that mcdonald's

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,459
has presence in and starbucks combined

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,920
our team is over 14,000 employees and

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:48,220
last year we earned almost four and a

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,470
half billion euro in revenue and even

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,420
known lesser fact about us is we've

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,390
consistently for the last few years been

00:03:52,420 --> 00:04:00,580
on Forbes magazine's list of top ten

00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:02,080
software companies in the world so what

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:08,910
is it that we do well if you've been

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:11,799
here or here or here chances are that

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,620
we've powered your journey you're

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,220
booking your actual travel and your

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:21,760
destination and you're saying wait a

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,560
minute I look for flights on kayak I

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,750
booked them on Expedia or American

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,630
Express I stay at a holiday and I fly

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,790
Southwest or

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,430
American Airlines what is AMA days have

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:34,010
to do with it well all of those plus

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,080
about 50 other well-known travel brands

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,500
in North America are customers of ours

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,440
and not only that if you look at it

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,960
globally we have thousands more

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,920
we have 90,000 travel agents that use

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,930
our platform we offer content from 700

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,990
Airlines over 700 airlines in the world

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,610
you can look for flights and book them

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,100
on our system we work with over half a

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,730
million hotels 200 airports and ground

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,230
handlers and to give you a little idea

00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,940
of what does that actually mean

00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,790
you know we last year we did about 600

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,190
million reservations it comes to you

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,530
know on some days we did 4 4 to 5

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,480
million reservations so reservation or

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,240
in the industry as it's known as a PNR a

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,340
passenger name record is basically your

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,890
record of a trip that includes flights

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,840
could include hotels rental cars my

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,610
guess is those of you that have travel

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,470
here from from out of town you know you

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,450
had a booking and you had a booking

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,540
reference and if you look closely at

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:36,110
that it's very there is a at least a 50%

00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:39,020
chance that your actual trip was

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,180
recorded in Amadeus we also have a very

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,180
strong airline business where we do

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,970
departure control flight management and

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,480
a whole host of other systems for the

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,240
airline industry and we do this for over

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:56,240
175 airlines and to give you an idea of

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,190
the scale there we had 1.4 million

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,970
person from 24 billion I'm sorry

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:06,740
passengers that boarded flights last

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:08,870
year using our platform and that roughly

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,030
equates to about 2,600 people every

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,910
minute or to put it differently in the

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,550
time that you've been listening to me

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,020
about 85 Boeing 747s have been filled

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,420
with passengers were about to leave on a

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,430
flight so think of that for a minute

00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,590
think of what that says to the mission

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:29,510
criticality and the scale of of there we

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:32,240
operate so how do we do it well first

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,580
and foremost we do it by a very strong

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,880
investment in engineering we are the

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,590
leading technology provider for the

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,510
travel sector we have 20 different R&D

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:46,320
locations including the one that I work

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:49,620
in north of Boston and we spend a lot we

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,960
spend a lot on engineering on building

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,550
new projects building new products

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,100
entering new markets serving new

00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,250
customers and continuing to get better

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,110
at what we do it's probably helpful to

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,060
take a quick trip down history Lane to

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,770
see how he got started and when the

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,410
company got started no surprise like a

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,210
lot of other companies at that time you

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,120
know we built a lot of our core systems

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,920
on mainframes and what that meant is we

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,740
had these modules in the back and we

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,690
essentially had terminals that we ship

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,900
to travel agents that used our systems

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,310
and there was basically no intelligence

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,230
in the terminal it was just a direct

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,800
connection back to the mainframe and

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,300
that kind of worked well and you know a

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,050
lot of companies still use mainframes

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,340
today until the PC came along but really

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,930
all that changed is we ended up putting

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,050
desktop clients so there was a better

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,180
interface for our users in some cases

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,680
users still preferred another profession

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,710
in the old system then we just put a

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,950
terminal emulator and then the web came

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,320
along and that's actually a screenshot

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:58,770
of a yahoo travel page back back from

00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,600
back in the day and when these changes

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,900
started happening we obviously had to

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,970
keep evolving and we built api's we

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,180
started working with the very early

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,700
browsers of the day then of course you

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,700
heard from our friends at AT&T this

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,230
morning and 10 years ago as mr. Jobs

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,580
famously said you know this changes

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,950
everything and it did change everything

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,870
you you heard how much more traffic the

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,170
carriers have had to deal with in the

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,630
last 10 years for us what it also meant

00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,000
is we saw a lot more b2b transactions a

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,980
lot more web sites came up offering

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,710
travel options and they were not

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,360
connecting to us like before with human

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,370
being sitting and terminals because

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,930
obviously there's a limit to how fast

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,630
somebody can type and the number of

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:46,260
transactions we get but we basically had

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,660
a whole b2b sector that we had to serve

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,790
that were automating the transactions

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,460
coming to us and dramatically increasing

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,420
the volume of what we did so our

00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,639
architecture about

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,139
time about five to six years ago looks

00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,810
something like this a very standard what

00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,700
I would call saw architecture we had a

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,519
services integrator that essentially was

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,550
a front-end and messaging broker we

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,740
served a variety of channels and then we

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,779
had a lot of backends that did very

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,250
specialized functions you know for the

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,810
travel industry you see their names out

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:20,279
there all supported by different

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,410
databases I mean all in all we're

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,610
talking about 5,000 micro services we

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,190
didn't call the micro services

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,620
necessarily back then about 1,500

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,740
databases and we were doing a peak of

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,660
about 80,000 transactions per second is

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,139
the kind of volumes that that we were

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,720
working with and to power all of this we

00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,120
had world-class infrastructure that's a

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,889
picture of our data center in the town

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,079
of heading in Germany right outside

00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:48,750
Munich Airport and it's a data center

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:50,940
that was purpose-built to serve us and

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,430
our customers because again 30 years ago

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,839
there were no general-purpose data

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,690
centers that you could rent out that

00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,579
would do everything you needed so this

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,769
is one of our largest so this is the

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:03,510
largest data center we have a host of

00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,399
other data centers all across the world

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:09,810
including a couple here in North America

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:12,149
and we are pretty used to operating

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,250
again you know at very large scale even

00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:18,570
on the infrastructure side we have close

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,579
to 20,000 infrastructure devices and we

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,269
change them quite a lot the cabling

00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:28,529
updates your OS updates your security

00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:30,660
patches and in the age of before CI and

00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:33,209
CD before continuous integration and

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,120
continuous development you know we still

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,430
made about 600 changes application

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,260
software changes every month so think

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,060
about that again translates to about

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,910
twenty to twenty-five changes every

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,970
single day so while we did not know or

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,279
did not practice continuous deployment

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,130
as we call it today you know we had a

00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:58,529
high degree of change and when you have

00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:01,170
that we had this problem so those of you

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:04,140
that smile you're obviously aware of the

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:07,570
the pets paradigm but we were no

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:10,240
different we had an application we would

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,519
a server to our data center we would

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,389
give it a loving name like a py

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:18,279
underscore 106 B and then when a py

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,410
underscore 106 B was not feeling well

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:24,160
you would call the expert doctors from

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,420
production support in level 2 and try

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,720
and get the server back to good health

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,009
so clearly that was now going to scale

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,199
with the amount of change that people

00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:35,079
were doing and we knew that we had to

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:37,600
move you know from pets to cattle or in

00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,579
other words through the data center as a

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,250
computer so the first step in our

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:45,000
journey was really to decouple what

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:49,509
should run from where it should run and

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,360
to do that these were our two trusted

00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:55,389
partnerships that we and tools that we

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,630
worked with you're a big user of Linux

00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:01,930
in fact over 90% of our servers run on

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,420
Linux at this point and we turned to

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,209
OpenStack to essentially help us build

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,829
an infrastructure as a service layer now

00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,329
Martine said this morning I don't know

00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,440
if he's still here but he put it very

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,389
elegantly that you have to first

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
virtualize before you change your

00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:17,319
abstractions and that is pretty much

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,529
what we did and in our case given kind

00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:22,389
of you know our relative newness to this

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,850
and the relative newness of this

00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:27,730
industry you know we worked with VMware

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,920
and we had a very what I call you know

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,709
very classic very traditional deployment

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,199
but we did manage over a couple of years

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,850
to completely virtualize our

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,699
infrastructure and have a true

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,639
infrastructure as a service using VMware

00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:46,680
integrated OpenStack or the compute side

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:49,180
we used NSX for the networking side and

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,100
in going through that process you know

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,810
we did realize a lot of the benefits

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,300
that you all are very familiar with and

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,000
that you would come to expect from

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,269
something like this so we did get much

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,250
better time to market we had a series of

00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:05,259
200 steps which took us about three

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,750
weeks to deploy a new server and we were

00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:10,269
able to get it down to basically 20

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,189
minutes I know you see this in marketing

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,089
brochures all the time there's something

00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:18,010
we were able to do we do it every day

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:19,389
the reason I'm here to talk about it is

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,459
also to give you a proof point that

00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:24,069
sometimes the exciting idea

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,420
that we we have from the research

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:28,389
community from the academic community

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,420
the projects that our friends in the

00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:33,639
vendor side or the carrier side work on

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:36,329
these do end up giving significant

00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,970
benefits to our business

00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:41,410
one interesting benefit was also

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:45,369
distributed logical routing and what we

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:47,619
realized is because of the the way Sdn

00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:52,119
works and because the way we configured

00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:54,819
nsx we were essentially able to reduce

00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:56,920
the amount of east-west traffic and what

00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:58,389
that meant is you know we were having

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,879
with the transaction volumes a big

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,350
problem with heat zones in the data and

00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,540
in the data center just in terms of

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,889
traffic volumes and that was reduced

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,670
significantly in addition to obviously

00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:12,100
improving the latency we were able to do

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,899
much better job at segmentation and

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,309
multi-tenancy again keep in mind we

00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:17,290
serve different lines of business

00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:19,389
different customers in different time

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,459
zones so this allowed us to do a much

00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:24,220
better job at segmenting that in

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:26,889
implementing multi-tenancy right down at

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,399
the network layer and the computer layer

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:31,839
and obviously thanks to the vast number

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,850
of tools and automation that was out

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,850
there you know our operations team was

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:41,799
able to do a much better job staying on

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:46,839
top of the infrastructure but we still

00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:48,639
had one problem and anybody that has

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,029
worked in development in operations like

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,529
me knows this is true and just because

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:57,730
you have a nice virtualized

00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:59,170
infrastructure doesn't mean your dev

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,290
team and your ops teams are talking

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:06,519
together we had a second problem and

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,769
that was you and you and me and all of

00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,429
us on our little phones and our tablet

00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:14,829
computers and always connected thanks to

00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:17,019
the ubiquitous networks we are always

00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:18,730
out there looking checking to see if we

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:22,269
can get a good deal on our next planned

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,949
vacation and that kept increasing the

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,389
amount of transaction load and the

00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:28,029
volumes that we had to deal with

00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:30,699
particularly in the front end and that

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,740
wasn't all I mean you have the range of

00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:35,290
devices and just in the last two years

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,389
we've seen a whole host of other

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,980
devices that have nothing to do with

00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:41,560
humans that have come on board and are

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,649
interacting with us we have hotels that

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,759
are trying to use robots in as virtual

00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:48,089
concedes in the lobby

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,360
we have airlines that are trying to use

00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:55,000
AR and VR to sell their product better

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,370
and all these devices at some point

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,860
create network traffic back into our

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,980
data centers to the extent that you

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,199
remember that 80,000 TPS number I talked

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,509
about a few minutes ago it's more like 1

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,870
million transactions every second and we

00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:12,519
routinely do I'd say 40 to 70 billion

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,790
transactions on any given day at this

00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,100
point and as we started dealing with

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,949
this linear growth exponential growth

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,389
almost in volumes I mean it was very

00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:25,180
clear to us that we had to get to a

00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,709
different model that just virtualizing

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,259
our infrastructure was not going to be

00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,519
enough but we had to deploy the

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,509
application as a whole

00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,680
now with all his dependencies two

00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:37,870
instances that could be managed you know

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,060
as clusters in other words you know we

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,760
had a virtualized but a very custom

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,980
infrastructure and we wanted to move to

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,370
a more standardized approach now the

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,959
beauty about standardization is no

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,690
secret why there's a container analogy

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,819
here but having containers meant that

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,949
you could not just load them on the big

00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:59,110
shipping carrier that could be our data

00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,699
center but you could put them on

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,880
airplanes you can put them on trucks

00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:05,740
they are easy to port around and that

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,500
led to the second phase in our journey

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:11,650
and that was really moving and building

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,390
our own platform as a service layer we

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:18,640
very cleverly call it the Amadeus cloud

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:22,089
services and to do this we have been

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,600
working with Red Hat and open shift it's

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:27,189
a pretty I would say given the the

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,440
lineage of speakers we've had here so

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,659
far and the the avant-garde work that

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,790
they are doing you know this is probably

00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:36,100
not that groundbreaking but it's still

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,809
pretty leading-edge for enterprise

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,299
running these kind of systems in

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:44,650
production to undertake and our approach

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:46,990
has been to use docker to containerize

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,150
our applications and then use kubernetes

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,460
from google for the deployment

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,370
the scaling and the management of those

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,390
containers so very quickly the way it

00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,860
works if you are familiar with

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,320
kubernetes this will just be a quick

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,110
recap for you but we take our

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,390
application in the containers you

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,210
specify a blueprint and those containers

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,760
run as pods and kubernetes you can then

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,620
specify you know how your parts scale

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,350
you can scale up you can scale down you

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,290
can have elastic scaling you can

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,350
obviously run multiple pods on a set of

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,940
given infrastructure and clusters and

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,830
then the beauty is you know the

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,470
self-healing part of it so if one

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,540
particular cluster of flames out the pod

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,410
essentially gets instantiated somewhere

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,900
else and life goes on now how did we do

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,660
the networking part of this and there's

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,730
a couple of options kubernetes provides

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,760
native api's allow you to have

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,850
visibility into the service endpoint we

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,280
took a different route and if you go

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:51,100
back to the thousands of micro services

00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,630
we have what we have been doing and I

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,420
say doing because this is a journey we

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,670
are we are on we have launched parts of

00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,980
this into production and every month

00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,030
every quarter we have a roadmap that we

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,540
are bringing more and more applications

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:06,300
and services into this paradigm but

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,820
basically you take our number of pods

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,960
that form a single service in our case

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,730
and what we use is we use a kubernetes

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,980
mechanism that allows each service to

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,470
essentially have its own IP address and

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,540
its own port and then we of course have

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,700
multiple services so the way it ends up

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:29,350
looking like each service gets its own

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:31,690
IPA its own port and then each node that

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,150
that service is running on basically has

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,700
you know local proxy that maintains the

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,850
topology it maintains the changes in the

00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,370
IP table and that allows the service

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,770
distribution to happen very easily and

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,090
happen automatically so basically you

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,040
know if a service is running on a

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:51,970
certain set of nodes and for whatever

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:54,130
reason for elasticity or for for

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,220
continuity purposes that service the red

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,930
one in this case were to move the

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,720
redirection pretty much happens on its

00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,790
own

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:08,550
so what we are definitely doing is

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:11,700
working with industry leaders working

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,830
with techniques that have a reasonable

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,750
chance or have been proven to work in

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,610
production so I'm not going to stand

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,490
here and save you we are coming up with

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,800
new ideas to do this like Martine talked

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,620
earlier or Amin talked earlier but we

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,700
are definitely following a model of very

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,470
close partnership and very rapid

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,150
iteration to make sure that we can

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,860
actually scale this not just in

00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,110
production but to work in

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,920
mission-critical applications like we do

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:43,500
and of the scales that we do so our

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,840
platform as-a-service has been in

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,900
production now for about a year and a

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,600
half and I mean some of the things that

00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,740
we've obviously benefited from one the

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,140
first one has been it's been a

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,260
tremendous benefit to our developers

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:01,220
because we've no longer had to restrict

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,330
them or no longer tied their application

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,400
environment choices to the

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,380
infrastructure we are going to have so

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,140
we essentially have given them the

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,910
freedom to build applications in the

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,120
languages in the methodologies they are

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,710
comfortable with we've also been giving

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,810
back to the open source community I

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,090
think it's a philosophy that when we

00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:23,570
started using and we started leveraging

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,540
open source code so obviously one of the

00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:28,830
code of conduct we're good citizens and

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:32,010
I'm thrilled to say that they've been

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,510
several key modules in the open shipped

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,760
community in the kubernetes community

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,650
and in several other open source

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,380
communities that are not networking

00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,290
related where our engineers have not

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,820
just been using open source but

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:49,280
contributing back you know peer-reviewed

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,280
code modules back into these forums

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,900
giving or implementing a platform as a

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,240
service for ourselves has also given us

00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,890
you know a level of flexibility for

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,630
business continuity purposes and this

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,660
means obviously when we need to move

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:06,420
workloads from one side to another we're

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,220
able to do that much much easier and

00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:11,670
much faster than we could do otherwise

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,780
and finally this is important our plate

00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,500
was kind enough to give you a little

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,870
flavor of my background and I

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,090
both on the vendor side I've worked in

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:23,590
other enterprise roles I vote for a

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:25,120
carrier and this whole concept of hybrid

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,820
cloud has been around for a long time

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,400
I think what what I'm really thrilled

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,200
about the way Amadeus has implemented

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,720
you know our technology roadmap and

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,030
vision is the fact that we actually have

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,309
implemented the hybrid cloud model it's

00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,340
not a theory it's not something you know

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,289
that we say we will do but you know we

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,820
do a little part of it this is something

00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,679
we have in production today it looks a

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,169
little bit like this you know we've

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,510
worked with the all three major public

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,950
cloud platforms and essentially what we

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,250
did is we took our infrastructure and

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,600
made it a private cloud so a lot of our

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,830
critical data and infrastructure still

00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:05,530
very much resides on Prem in our in our

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,299
data centers but we are now giving our

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,820
customers the choice to run certain

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,460
parts and certain applications you know

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,320
either in their data centers or on a

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,850
cloud provider of their choosing so by

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,000
getting that platform and service layer

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,260
you know we are able to essentially

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,350
truly abstract the applications we

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,419
provide from the infrastructure that

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,460
that it runs on and a good example of

00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:28,570
that this is on our website you can go

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,970
look it up if you are interested

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:34,480
something we do for the airlines

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:36,789
is the airline availability application

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,860
that we have and we have this again in

00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:41,740
production with a bunch of Airlines

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,510
where we do revenue management the

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,830
inventory kind of all the algorithms

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:50,590
that go behind calculation of flight

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,600
availability and we run this in our data

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:55,390
center but we also distribute that

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,559
availability algorithms and databases on

00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:01,690
multiple cloud locations and we are able

00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,909
to do this you know thanks to our

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,830
platform as a service that we build with

00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:09,669
again with openshift

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:11,380
and using kubernetes so that we can

00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:13,870
peacefully coexist you know with

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,840
multiple cloud providers for the sake of

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:19,659
our our customers and our business so

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,880
some quick closing thoughts I'm going to

00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:25,330
share some of my observations and and

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,220
what's worth going to channel my energy

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,970
aura here you know do or do not I think

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,710
a lot

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,840
of times companies do get stuck into

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,370
should we do this should we not do it is

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,380
the technology ready is it really going

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,770
to give us the benefits it is very easy

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,660
to just be in that mode and not take the

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:43,000
next step and I think what we have found

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,730
is having good strong leadership and a

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,280
good strong internal vision is very

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,730
important because it gives our teams the

00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,890
flexibility to go down an uncharted path

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,140
to some extent it gives them the freedom

00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,760
to work with industry leaders and to

00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,500
work in a model where you can partner

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,530
together to solve a lot of common

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,910
problems together it is a brave new

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,430
world especially when you talk about

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:09,780
DevOps and when you have teams that I've

00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:13,330
been working in very specific you know

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,830
siloed mode to some extent you know it's

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,200
very hard to be in this shared

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,910
responsibility and this continuous

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,130
integration continuous deployment of

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:23,680
code model and it is something you have

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:27,190
to as an organization really encourage

00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,110
and nurture and speaking of nurturing I

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,660
think it's equally important you know

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:34,240
the kind of culture you have for your

00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,190
engineers and we're again very fortunate

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,000
that our engineers are a very curious

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,740
Bunch

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,140
they'd like to find out what's going on

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,390
they challenge themselves even if nobody

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,100
else is doing so and they bring new

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:49,690
ideas and new approaches to us

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:52,240
constantly and in doing so probably the

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:55,530
last kind of take away I would say is

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,700
remember the Y you know we're not a

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:01,510
well-known research institution like

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,910
some of you represent here we are not a

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,090
maker of equipment like others of you

00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,430
here are we're very much users of the

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,720
brilliant thinking you do and their

00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:14,200
innovative engineering you do in

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,520
bringing solutions to us but the reason

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,110
we do it and the reason the

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,270
software-defined strategy is so

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,360
important is it does allow you at the

00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,860
risk of sounding a little marketing like

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,280
you know I do hear all this and which is

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:29,800
focus on business innovation the more

00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,140
our teams are able to less worry about

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,370
the infrastructure and scaling of the

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,590
infrastructure and doing so

00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,470
automatically and doing so reliably the

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,330
more we are able to actually focus on

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,440
specific problems that our industry and

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,509
our customer

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,179
saying we did something at South by

00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:47,769
Southwest with a customer of ours United

00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:49,990
Airlines where if you're watching a

00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:52,149
movie and you you are interested in a

00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:54,370
location you can pause and you can check

00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:57,100
details about where that was film and

00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:00,610
you can look at travel options to get

00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,590
there but what I'm proud of really even

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,539
more is something our team did last

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:07,299
month and this is a good example of how

00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:10,389
you can free up your teams to do more

00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:11,769
creative innovative thinking and it's a

00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:14,259
small team that essentially came

00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:16,720
together and I come from Boston where

00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:18,879
the weather is slightly different from

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,679
here let's put it that way and we were

00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:22,389
going through some pretty rough weather

00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,860
days and we said there must be a way in

00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:25,960
which we can give better tools to our

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,990
travel agency customers so we've worked

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,870
with a start-up in the Boston area and

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,789
literally over a period of a few days we

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:37,480
were able to ID it and come up with this

00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:39,340
solution idea that is going to be good

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,559
for our customers going to be good for

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,899
our business but most importantly it'll

00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,700
be good for all of you as travelers

00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:48,210
let's take a quick look at that and

00:27:45,700 --> 00:28:39,709
after that we'll do questions thank you

00:27:48,210 --> 00:28:39,709
[Music]

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,480
thank you again by the way just

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,700
interesting aside that video is also

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,060
made by three or four engineers it's not

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,230
made by an outside production house so

00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:55,460
engineers can be very multi-talented

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,460
