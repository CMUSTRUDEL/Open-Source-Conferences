00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:15,179
director of the Linux Foundation Jim

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:17,670
Zebulon hello good afternoon we for

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,490
those of you in the back we've got a few

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,890
seats over here and I think we have some

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,560
over here we're kind of tight on seating

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,769
here so if you have someone trying to

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,199
get in please allow them to get in

00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:33,809
welcome to the open networking summit

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,480
2017 we've got a great lineup this week

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,059
an amazing set of speakers and content

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,120
and hackathons and all sorts of good

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,620
stuff and it's a tremendous year I'd

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,960
like to first start by thanking our

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:51,660
sponsors Intel at as our diamond sponsor

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:56,629
platinum sponsors Amdocs and Huawei and

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,800
our gold sponsors Dell EMC and Ericsson

00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,199
another quick announcement if you need

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,910
any assistance please contact the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,350
registration desk we have lots of

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,229
different tracks going on if you get a

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,810
little bit confused go ahead and ask

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,189
them for help

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,500
so I thought I would spend a few minutes

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,320
at the opening here talking a little bit

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,460
about where we are as an industry and

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,840
about some of the things that have been

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,320
going on in 2017 in an open source and

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,540
networking and I want to start by saying

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,240
and tipping the hat to John gage of Sun

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,680
Microsystems a long time ago that after

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,570
25 years this is now actually true the

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,549
network really is the computer and my

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,110
favorite story about this is one that

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,670
was relayed to me actually last week by

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,990
a gentleman named min Joon who's at

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,759
Facebook

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,369
he works on their telecom infrastructure

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,420
project which is a really cool open

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,610
source project around telecom

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,189
infrastructure he said that at Facebook

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,229
you have this six-month boot camp where

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,090
all the engineers who work there come in

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,229
they take this six-week bootcamp and

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,329
they learn all about Facebook's

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,579
infrastructure and then after that six

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,799
weeks they go and sort of find a home in

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,740
the different groups within Facebook on

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,140
the application side or whatever and a

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:13,040
few years ago nobody wanted to go over

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,920
to the network engineering side but

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,390
now that really the network is where all

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,519
the action is happening it's

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,969
programmable it really is this

00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,819
incredibly dynamic software driven piece

00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:27,500
of their infrastructure that tons of

00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:30,019
Engineers now want to go there and I

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,750
think the same thing is happening across

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:36,129
the industry that the network now is

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,780
this rich managed programmable

00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:41,480
orchestration tool that's driving so

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,269
much of cloud computing an open-source

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,620
is certainly a huge part of that just at

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,750
the Linux Foundation we've seen an

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,359
explosion in the last five years the

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,510
number of open-source projects around

00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:55,430
the networking sector our most recent

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,099
project the open network automation

00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,870
platform is a management and

00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:03,319
orchestration platform that is in

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,419
production at companies like AT&T in

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,489
fact the open network automation

00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:10,909
platform this manno project that we have

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:13,220
it's even bigger the mono is has

00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:15,590
representatives from China Mobile China

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,260
Telecom China Yukon Bell Canada AT&T and

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,060
others essentially representing 40

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,370
percent of the world's mobile

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,590
subscribers this is open source code

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,229
production grade and I can kind of keep

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,620
on going and it's not just at the Linux

00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:32,569
Foundation open source is all over the

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,699
place whether it's at the Open Compute

00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,959
Project at the hardware level I already

00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:38,180
mentioned the telecom infrastructure

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,310
project things like the open source mono

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,340
project the open networking foundation

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,379
you name it there is lots and lots of

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,690
code out there for everyone to play with

00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,540
and build really interesting solutions

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:55,970
around and today we're welcoming another

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:59,060
project to our roster the DPD Kay

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,180
project is now housed at the Linux

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,310
Foundation we have a big set of

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,349
supporters who are backing that project

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,959
that we're announcing today and you can

00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:12,379
see and you will see even more work

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,180
going on here to allow for data planning

00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,310
and service acceleration through this

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,889
important critical project now at a

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,479
neutral home at the Linux Foundation

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,490
we're also announcing free range router

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,729
an IP routing protocol suite for Linux

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,380
and UNIX platforms is home now at the

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,540
Linux Foundation

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,970
and you can go to our website to find

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,770
out more about this exciting process a

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,580
project in all of the investment that

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,940
will help there too so all of this is

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,370
good we've got a lot of code out there

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:47,780
but it does create a problem lots of

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,900
code but not a lot of time you see there

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:53,090
are millions of open-source projects out

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,280
there right I mean it's not just an even

00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:00,410
in networking it's at every layer of the

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,900
stack github alone hosts 54 million open

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,640
source projects the real question for

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,890
all of you is there are all these

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,450
projects there's all these code the real

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:14,030
question is which ones really matter

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,830
which ones should I invest my time in

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,900
which one should I invest my career and

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,660
which one should I take a meaningful

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,160
commercial dependency upon that is the

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,110
real question that we want to talk about

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,530
this week at ons in particular around

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,450
networking and at the Linux Foundation

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,300
we think that projects that you can bank

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,970
on whether it's a networking or anywhere

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,669
else are projects that have sustainable

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,370
ecosystems this is the thing that you

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:41,930
should be looking for an ecosystem where

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,460
you have a really good developer

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,320
community from a diverse set of

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,979
stakeholders who create great code

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,530
provide true value which creates profit

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,360
you're a company you use that code it

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,100
could be cost savings if you're a

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,380
government it could be transparency and

00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,860
then that value creation is then

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,950
reinvested back into the project it

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,800
looks like this this is what all of the

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:11,300
networking projects whether it's onus

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,310
cord opendaylight OPN efi you name it at

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,340
the Linux Foundation are all looking to

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,330
achieve this same thing working with the

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:22,130
industry and developers to create

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:27,500
sustainable projects that will endure

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:29,419
for a very very long time and so the big

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,490
theme for this week is how do we

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,650
overcome the remaining challenges in the

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,320
networking ecosystem to create these

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:40,039
sustainable ecosystems well the number

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,590
one thing is it's the code without good

00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:42,630
code

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,400
you're not gonna have any outcome at all

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,950
we still need to keep our eyes on

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,690
building developer communities around

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,490
all these projects that will solve

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,040
really tough problems with really

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,590
well-written code but in addition to

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,270
that we need to harmonize these projects

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,030
that's one of the big themes this week

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,910
at OH&S is how do we harmonize up and

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,590
down the stack if we have you know three

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,360
or four different projects that every

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,280
whether it's at data plane services or

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,139
all the way up to mono how do we

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,540
harmonize those how do we create a set

00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,910
of common api's configuration language

00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,580
and so forth so that this code works

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,580
more effectively as a broad solution as

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,760
opposed to an individual piece part and

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,790
it's not just that the industry is going

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,919
through a big cultural change this is

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,169
most predominant in the networking

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,389
sector now I was just at Mobile World

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,160
Congress and I met with over 50

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,620
organizations it was an incredible week

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,729
and none of those organizations whether

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,280
it was a global operator or a product

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,770
vendor or a cloud service provider

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,080
wanted to talk about specific technology

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,530
they all wanted to talk about change

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,470
management how do I retrain the 20,000

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,289
Network admins that I employ today to be

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,240
software-defined networking DevOps

00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,100
professionals how do I teach them how to

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,070
code how do I teach them about this new

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,200
technology how do I retrain restructure

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,600
my workforce to do that this is going to

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,330
be a critical challenge for in

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,229
particular the networking sector because

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:18,030
it's sort of over invested in a way that

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,750
will be challenging to convert to this

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,729
new Sdn world so that's one of the

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,110
things we really want to focus on and

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:28,590
we're going to talk a lot about at this

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,930
event in addition we need to continue to

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,610
teach organizations how to manage open

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,050
source how to participate in these

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,839
communities both from a technical

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,490
perspective but also from a legal and a

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,800
business process perspective how do you

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,229
pull code in share what you want to

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,480
share keep what you want to keep how do

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,800
you make that process work this is

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,110
something that we really want to focus

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,770
on and will help us build this great

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,060
shared technology asset together and

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,529
then finally

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,730
the last thing we need to do in

00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,460
networking that we're going to be

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,930
talking about a bunch this week is

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,870
harmonizing the process of standard

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,580
setting and open source development open

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,980
source development is now one of the

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,870
leading ways where we create code that

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,060
interoperates across a wide variety of

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,800
networks but standards will still be

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,240
critically important and you're going to

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,130
hear from the folks at the Linux

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,770
Foundation about efforts we are working

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,140
on with Metro Ethernet forum with I

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,510
Triple E with other standard setting

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,880
bodies to make sure that standards and

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,040
code can exist harmoniously these are

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,950
big things that if we do them we can

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:36,240
build an incredibly strong shared

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:38,730
technology asset for networking and so I

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,040
hope you enjoy this event this week I

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,770
hope you learn a lot and we hope to see

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,200
you back again next year I want to thank

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:49,700
you for attending and introduce our next

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,170
speaker who is a very special person

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:57,240
many of you know him come on up the

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:59,660
executive director of OEO Republica good

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,040
to see you here before you get started

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,720
before you get started we actually have

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,990
a surprise for guru that's right come on

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,580
out

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,720
so guru many of you probably know this

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,430
if you've been attending on us we're

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,670
late but this is the guy who started the

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,800
open networking summit years ago but

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,230
more than that guru has really been one

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,210
of the people who has driven the concept

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,900
of Sdn throughout the inner plot the

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:31,350
industry a tireless engineer supporter

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,610
architect leader he really can it can be

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,800
said that he's one of the founders of

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,589
this movement and in recognition of

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,830
years of work we wanted to give you this

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:44,050
small token of our grantees give a hand

00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:47,679
to guru Paul occur

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,869
thank you thank you so much very nice of

00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,480
you really appreciate it I didn't expect

00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:54,759
I didn't know this so I'm really touched

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,079
I appreciate what you've done all right

00:10:54,759 --> 00:11:04,540
you have to hold that your entire talk

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:06,759
thank you Thanks okay again thanks Linux

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,910
Foundation and gym so again good

00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,670
afternoon and welcome to 2017 open

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,799
networking summit as Jim mentioned that

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,389
we have a very exciting program for you

00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,999
for the next three three and a half days

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,470
where we will try to showcase all the

00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:24,069
progress we have been making as a

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:28,600
community in open networking open source

00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:31,420
Sdn and NFV and so on what I want to do

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,809
is to take a few minutes to talk about

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,679
the ONS journey and the SBN journey so

00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:41,709
far and what to expect going forward

00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:45,879
okay so as Jim mentioned actually Nick

00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:48,970
McEwen Dan Pitts and myself started open

00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:52,899
networking summit in 2011 at Stanford

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:56,619
University and then last year we agreed

00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:59,920
to make open networking summit a part of

00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:02,559
Linux Foundation as open networking was

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,689
becoming more and more about open source

00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,490
and so that was the right thing to do

00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:08,829
and this year we completed the

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,629
transition and you can see that this

00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:15,519
year it is completely a Linux Foundation

00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:19,089
event during all these years ons has

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,579
remained at the premier Sdn open

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:24,339
networking open source networking event

00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:26,799
for all this time and I want to take

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,139
this opportunity to thank you all for

00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,839
all your support as well as

00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:34,749
participation in open networking submit

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,910
for all these years also more

00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:39,249
importantly I want to both congratulate

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,110
you and thank you for all the progress

00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:44,379
we have been making in the community

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:48,339
about open networking open source as DNN

00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:50,619
fe and so on as Jim mentioned I also

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,990
want to of course thank Jim and Linux

00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:55,919
foundation for taking over awareness and

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,070
taking it forward in a significant way

00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,500
there is

00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,030
one more person that I want to

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,620
especially acknowledge her name is the

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,840
deaf Oscar and I don't know whether

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,870
she's here in the audience so she has

00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:11,200
been my partner in Open Networking

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,660
Summit for all the years and responsible

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,170
for onf operations and I could not have

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,330
done ons without her and maybe part of

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,030
this whatever award I got from Linux

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,820
Foundation belongs to her as well okay

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:29,020
so we died let me turn my attention to

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:33,010
the SDN journey so until a few years ago

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,260
our industry can be best described or

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,080
defined by what can be thought of as

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,200
closed proprietary and vertically

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,230
integrated systems that inhibits

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,380
innovation and that made that

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:50,620
contributed to network operators high

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,080
capex and OPEX and network operators in

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,260
ability to create new services and

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,990
create new revenue streams for them okay

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,240
as Jim already mentioned we have made

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:04,570
tremendous progress during the past

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,710
several years and that progress can be

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,060
best described or I did defined by

00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,910
disaggregation disaggregation of

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,340
networking devices software ization and

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,100
virtualization that is programmable

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,320
control planes programmable forwarding

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,980
planes as well as network virtualization

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,900
and network function virtualization and

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,660
finally of course open source emergence

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,630
of many many open source components and

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,700
open source platforms and another way to

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,520
look at this and I think Jim already

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,190
covered this very well but at the bottom

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,500
most we have merchants silicon which can

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,120
give you very high performance but as

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,850
well as can give you program ability

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,560
then we have these white boxes with open

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,050
source component that can be used in

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,540
production networks then you know Sdn

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,880
controllers then network orchestration

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,500
and management and then all kinds of

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,880
virtual network functions and services

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,120
some open some closed okay now so far

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,070
when we think about disaggregation and

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,890
open source we think of it in terms of

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,840
data centers and cloud providers it is

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,910
true that that is where this

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,210
segregation and open source started and

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,250
has the biggest adoption so far but to

00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:21,100
me the most exciting and most

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,070
interesting thing about open source and

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,740
open networking is this particular trend

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,320
of disaggregation and open source is

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,540
taking hold in all these markets that

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,580
you see and that is together it is

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,650
pretty big and very significant and

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,720
offers a lot of opportunities and

00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:42,520
challenges as well ok but others for Jim

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,890
also mentioned right when you look at

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,140
all this disaggregation when you look at

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,790
all these open source platforms and you

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,030
think about yourself as a network

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,850
operator or even a vendor if you want to

00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:57,040
build integrated solutions and deploy

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,020
them in the production setting doing

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,060
that with all these building blocks and

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,610
all these open source components is

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,350
represents a significant challenge and I

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,260
will say that is our grand challenge for

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,360
every industry today so what we need

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,550
more than anything today Jim already

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,400
mentioned about harmonization and that

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,320
is definitely very very important

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,570
another thing that we need to do is to

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,470
now think about how we can build

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:25,690
integrated solutions that can leverage

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,150
network device disaggregation and many

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,980
open source platform and deliver an

00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,950
integrated solution that is easy to

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,620
consume and easy to deploy and finally

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,320
again as Jim also mentioned we need

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,080
software-defined standards that make it

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,050
easier to plug and play as well as

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,080
provide interoperability among all these

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,750
different open source building blocks ok

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,990
now if you don't mind I want to quickly

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,030
tell you about what this open networking

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,580
a new open networking foundation is

00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:01,030
doing which is the combination of onf

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,920
and the open networking lab what we are

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,430
trying to do with our mission is to help

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,500
network operators and service providers

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,230
transform their infrastructure into a

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,520
platform for service innovation because

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,200
that's what they are wanting to do

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,860
that's what we want to make it happen

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,740
but by leveraging this network

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,260
disaggregation open source platforms as

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,770
well as software-defined standards and

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,560
what we want to do is

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:30,620
helped build integrated solutions that

00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,620
are easy to consume and deploy and then

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,290
drive them through lab trials to field

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,710
trials to production deployment okay and

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,060
as we do that we have an opportunity to

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,580
build what we are calling

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,250
software-defined standards because once

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,470
we have operational software and we are

00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,090
putting together in solutions and we are

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,520
putting together with other open-source

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,800
building blocks we have an opportunity

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,490
to define these standards that specify

00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,680
either api's data models information

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,480
model about how you can plug these

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,940
open-source components together and

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,460
that's what the opportunity then what we

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,520
are trying to do and finally the idea is

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,920
that if you are a vendor or a company we

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,620
want to make it easier for you to plug

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,200
your innovation into this into an open

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,600
innovation pipeline and make it easier

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,690
to move that innovation all the way into

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,690
customers production network with

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:30,350
significantly reduced R&D investment as

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,240
well as significantly lower time to

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,770
market and that is the kind of value

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,620
proposition we want to bring to the

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:39,320
vendors now I want to give you a few

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,940
examples the good news is that at open

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,490
networking lab and open networking

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,650
foundation there are a few open

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:48,350
innovation pipeline that are already in

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,660
place for a few big markets like

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,600
broadband residential access mobile

00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:56,630
access enterprise wide area network and

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,310
packet optical networks okay so if you

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,980
look at the work we have been doing with

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,840
Ana's and Cod and some of the youth

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,060
cases and solution that we have been

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,820
building it turns out that we have

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,940
created multiple open innovation

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,030
pipeline as an example if you look at a

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,110
residential chord in residential chord

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,400
if you look at the hardware

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:22,190
infrastructure we bring white boxes for

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,710
olt devices for japan we use white boxes

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,230
for leaf spine fabric we use of course

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,270
server those other white boxes we build

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,370
a coherent hardware infrastructure on

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,740
top of that if you look at the software

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,840
stack that software stack is built with

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,010
many open source building blocks all the

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:43,380
way from OpenStack darker

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:45,870
or NASA then Sdn controller then X OS

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,570
and then many virtual network functions

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,940
that are implemented as services that

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,070
are managed and orchestrated by this X

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,080
OS platform so and we are already

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,330
putting this all together in a solutions

00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,790
form and some of this is going through

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,400
lab trial and field trial and hopefully

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,350
in a production deployment in multiple

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,840
service providers before end of the year

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,510
we are doing the same thing for mobile

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,680
court applying that to radio access

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:16,590
network mobile packet code as well as

00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,290
the mobile edge computing okay and then

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,000
we are doing something similar for

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,790
Enterprise card and the packet optical

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,740
networks as well so we have the multiple

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,810
innovation pipeline that are creating

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,230
solutions that are easier to deploy

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:33,300
now clearly onf is not doing this in

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,600
isolation we have brought two large

00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,310
ecosystems ecosystems of onf and open

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,410
networking lab they are like 200

00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,450
companies with number of leading service

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,030
providers system vendors chip vendors

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,440
software vendor system integrators that

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,410
are all coming together and working

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,600
together on this particular thing and

00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,840
the idea that we want to help service

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,780
providers create platform to turn their

00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,580
network into platform for service

00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,980
innovation and we want to help vendors

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,870
take their innovation and move it into

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,690
production network of their customers

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:11,580
very quickly by reducing our nd cost as

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:13,350
well as time to market ok now all of

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,880
this is well and good but there are a

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,160
couple of challenges that we are still

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,500
experiencing the first thing is when you

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,300
talk about taking something to

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,680
production readiness and deploying

00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,270
something all the way into the

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,340
production network there is a

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,370
significant amount of investment and

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,110
skills that are required ok and when you

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,910
look at many open source projects

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,910
including open source project that are

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,370
going on at for example onf or other

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,890
places we are able to create enough

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,990
proof-of-concept lab trials maybe couple

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,260
of deployment but that is it if you

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,330
really want to do this for production

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,730
you need significantly more investment

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,110
and you need significant resources and

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,030
you can

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,650
see there is the resource gap and the

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,900
question is who is going to make this

00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:59,600
investment where is how are we going to

00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,420
plug this research gap especially given

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,240
that there seems to be a major

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:07,730
misalignment of in incentives if you

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,160
look at network operators yes they want

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,100
to build open-source Sdn nfe networks

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,570
obviously right building a network this

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,429
aggregate leveraging network

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,130
disaggregation open source in all of

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:21,890
that however they don't necessarily have

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,410
enough development resources and they

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,780
don't have investments to make to be

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,429
able to do it on their own now if you

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,640
look at vendors yes they have

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:34,160
established products they have you know

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,799
processes they have revenue stream they

00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,960
have large pools of developers but this

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,850
whole network this aggregation and open

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,809
source is quite disruptive to their

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,330
business model

00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:46,370
now system integrators they see lot of

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,440
opportunity with network disaggregation

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:51,140
and open source but again they don't

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,049
have necessarily the expertise resources

00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,720
and investment to be able to make this

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:59,240
work so what that means is that if the

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,610
incentives are not aligned that leads to

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,140
insufficient investment that means we

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,030
cannot take some of this to real

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,640
production deployment and really bring

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,320
about the change we want to make so that

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,940
is something to think about because as

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,040
much as we are excited about all the

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,640
progress we have made this is something

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,500
to be thinking about so my last slide so

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,179
what you have is yes we have made

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,580
tremendous progress with disaggregation

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:24,620
software ization and virtualization open

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,600
source and we a lot of exciting work

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,809
ahead of us in terms of harmonizing

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,660
integrated solutions and all that but

00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:35,090
what we had to keep in mind is we had to

00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,640
find a way to align incentives creates

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,919
efficient investment and that will lead

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,809
to production deployment and that is the

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,419
only way we are going to really bring

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:47,750
about the kind of change we all are here

00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:49,580
for and what we hope for and again at

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,530
open networking summit over the next

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,140
three three and 1/2 days hopefully you

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,150
will see some of this in action so come

00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,770
and check out and then of course you

00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,720
will get to talk about some of these

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,890
issues as well so again thank you so

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,820
much really appreciate your

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,980
participation

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,800
our next speaker is our pet

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:14,510
Joshua who is new to Linux Foundation he

00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:16,880
will introduce himself alright

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:20,990
excited to be at the Linux Foundation

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:24,860
and your host for this o NS let me tell

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:27,740
you what we did when we joined or when I

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,970
joined the Linux Foundation we took you

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,940
know I've been in your position I've

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:35,450
been a you know sat right where Michael

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:39,110
said I have been an attendee I have been

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:41,780
a participant an exhibitor a sponsor a

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:44,450
keynote speaker okay so I understand

00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,740
what we need as an audience and so we

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,250
went back and looked at all your

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:52,340
feedback and so of all the six years and

00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:56,180
so this ons is designed based on that

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:59,780
okay and let me tell you why we believe

00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:04,670
networking is cool again okay let's go

00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:08,480
and first tell you who is here okay

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:11,240
and my goal today is just to tell you

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,550
how you can make your time efficient

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,630
that's it I'm not giving any pitches

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:20,750
okay there's an equal representation

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:25,520
from service providers also known as

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:28,970
carriers cloud and enterprise we have

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,850
about half and half technical as well as

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,790
business architecture in terms of the

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:38,600
attendee power in the audience we have a

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:43,430
third that work and the other two-thirds

00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,110
that make decisions okay not quite but

00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:48,380
that's that's kind of just the breakdown

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:52,520
okay let me let me tell you a little bit

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,740
more all of the major enterprise

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,050
verticals are represented like this is

00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,750
the first ons where we have proactively

00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,820
requested a lot of enterprise presence

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,010
and you can see why there's a lot of

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,750
convergence between cloud Enterprise

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,760
carriers right the boundaries are

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,070
blurring so we have the top enterprise

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,320
verticals whether its financial

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,780
manufacturing healthcare business etc of

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,450
course all the vendors who supply to the

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,970
enterprise's are here we have

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,390
keynote speech speeches from the top

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:25,310
cloud providers we have the carrier

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,220
infrastructure vendors and best in fact

00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:30,620
all of them we have the top five service

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:34,640
providers here and most importantly as

00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:37,910
as Jim alluded to in the audience you

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,190
know if if we don't align properly half

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,470
of the global mobile subs will be

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,960
impacted that's the power of this room

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:47,630
so the quality of people we have today

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,400
is just outstanding so take advantage of

00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,040
that in the Holloway conversation and

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,420
and make sure you sort of at least ping

00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,650
your neighbor on on what they do okay

00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,440
let me give you a sneak peek at some of

00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:03,770
the keynotes they are insightful and

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,940
visionary if you need to understand the

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:11,060
role of networking and how hundred and

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:14,030
twenty nine billion transactions are

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:17,780
carried out just wait for 30 minutes

00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:22,070
Justin will be here and then we have all

00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,900
the buzzwords containers 5g IOT so let

00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,330
me tell you one progress as a community

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,990
we should all be proud of is in the next

00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,450
two years

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:33,410
all our acronyms have moved from three

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:37,010
letters to two letters okay AI bi CI v

00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:38,450
are AR you know you name it 5g okay so

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,380
that you should all give yourself a

00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,490
round of applause for that

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:46,240
just kidding we have another very

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:49,520
interesting vertical represented here

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,760
what does network do to transport all

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,430
these passengers right I mean we all

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,770
travel but how do what's the data center

00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,000
networking stroll listen to that right I

00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,240
mean this is a very different

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,370
perspective and it's not just VLANs and

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,410
IP addresses and you know port numbers

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:10,900
we've done that before we have been

00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:13,430
geeks okay there's another one

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,340
networking is used and this is open

00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:18,110
source networking in molecular analysis

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,700
to solve cancer right this is very

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:25,760
interesting how do you do that right get

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,680
them behind the stories from how do two

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,050
of the largest world operators come

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,550
together AT&T and China Mobile Jim

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,560
mentioned the owner

00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,870
one thing is the architecture but the

00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,670
other thing is is the culture right how

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:40,270
do you bring those communities together

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:44,990
and of course you will hear a lot about

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:45,740
5g okay one key takeaway if you remember

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,970
nothing else

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:52,760
5g mandates Network automation you can't

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,740
have a smart meter on a call with an

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,430
operator trying to register on a network

00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,200
okay

00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,470
it's not going to happen so just

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,000
remember that and there's a lot of that

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:06,140
over the over the course of the session

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,930
all right as far as the tracks are

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:13,510
concerned it's a very simple algorithm

00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:16,190
there are five tracks depending on your

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,930
inclination you can either go to a

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,330
general track these are you know

00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:23,360
hardware and a-six and security and you

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,740
know basic common building blocks or you

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,920
can take a carrier track or an

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:32,650
enterprise cloud track and within that

00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:36,550
you're either a developer or you are a

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:39,770
product management CTO architecture so

00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:42,650
effectively that's a 2x2 plus an

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:44,630
additional track so feel free do again

00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,540
you can cross boundaries but we have

00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,430
adjusted it so that you know you it

00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,750
doesn't compete with itself and of

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,870
course morning and evening we'll have

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,670
keynotes okay beyond that we already

00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,790
started with a hackathon that's going to

00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:00,440
go through the day so do visit that

00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:03,200
educational tracks I saw most of them

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,300
they were like full standing-room-only a

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,610
lot of meetups a lot of summit a lot of

00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,410
mini summits exhibits are going to open

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,230
shortly and you know it's the most

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:15,170
visited thing this awards reception you

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,540
know you name it so last slide I want to

00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:19,790
sort of show is there's a lot of

00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,770
announcements that will go on but from a

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,870
networking perspective and an open

00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:27,250
source networking which is what sort of

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:30,800
I own we're really proud to sort of

00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:33,260
announce today one of our leading

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,540
operators reliance Geo from India this

00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,280
is the fastest growing largest 4G LTE

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,670
network over a hundred million

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,200
subscribers they just joined our app and

00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,860
just stay tuned I know I've gotten a lot

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,360
of questions on when an app is cool

00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,220
we open to the community we're just

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,210
doing a rebranding you know naming

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:55,090
change just stay tuned it's happening

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,799
the other piece of announcement for

00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,780
those of you are working on Opie NFV and

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,580
the Danube release let me tell you it's

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:04,410
flowing quite well this week okay and

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:07,510
then Jim already covered the DP DK and

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:10,870
free-range routing so with that what I

00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:13,929
wanted to do was bring up two keynotes

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:17,919
this afternoon and while I introduce my

00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:21,400
first keynote I wanted to tell you that

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,620
true to the tradition of ONS this is the

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,110
only conference you know I've been to

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:30,340
and I support where you can ask

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:33,220
questions in keynotes okay so if nobody

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,830
stands up we'll cancel that privilege so

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,860
I'm hoping that people would have their

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:41,770
mics in the middle just line up and ask

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:44,770
the questions to the presenters anything

00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:47,770
goes just don't pitch your product but

00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,720
otherwise anything goes and and so with

00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:53,679
that said let me introduce our first

00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:56,280
keynote speaker we all know him so no

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,679
introduction required see VP from

00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,050
Microsoft as your networking Albert

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:07,230
