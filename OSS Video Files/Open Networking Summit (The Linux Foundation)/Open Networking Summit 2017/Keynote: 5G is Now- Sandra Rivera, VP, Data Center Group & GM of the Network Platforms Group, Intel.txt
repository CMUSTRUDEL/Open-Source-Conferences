	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,049
good morning I bet if I asked each of

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,139
you what 5g means to you that I would

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,200
get almost as many different answers as

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:16,049
there are people in this room and many

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,500
of you would think of 5g as something

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,930
that's way off in the future but from an

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,420
infrastructure perspective 5g is

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,599
actually happening right now and if

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,050
anything I believe we need to go even

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,260
faster

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,200
I don't have the opportunity to ask each

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,079
one of you what you think about 5g so we

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,940
conducted a not so scientific survey of

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,160
the average person on the street and

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,590
asked them what they thought about 5g

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:50,910
what 5g means to them and this is what

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:52,590
they said hey everybody I'm Sarah

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,989
Sweeney and we're here in New York's

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,539
Grand Central Station asking real people

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,520
what they know about 5g and some of the

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,520
innovations it will bring let's go

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:07,759
can I talk to you for a second about

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,530
five g's whoa tell me about it

00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:15,049
no idea what it is you tell me about

00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:18,229
five G stands for 5 grand 5 so 5 G isn't

00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:21,229
a good thing about 5 G is it puts a lot

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,930
into a small package spongy it's um I

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:26,780
know that like is it has to do with

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,090
Wi-Fi right is that the 5g that they do

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:35,810
put a phone order network like that

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:38,210
there is I say 5g you say internet fast

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,390
4G do you know what the G's don't work I

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:45,530
don't you know she you know yes you are

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:49,310
the first guys good yeah if you have 4G

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,799
that's the 4th generation to generation

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,500
to generation its generation it's the

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,299
fifth generation oh my dog allergies oh

00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,840
my god that's why we're in the fortified

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:02,209
it is the new 5th generation wireless

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,380
communications technology that new

00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:09,360
spectrum approved by the FCC of 28 37

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,890
and 39 gigahertz fans yeah

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,630
you heard me ask somebody else you

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,720
looked it up on Wikipedia Tintin

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,740
yeah have you ever heard about Intel let

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,630
me spit about it

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,150
it's 5g technology and here's what's

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,320
legit about it I believe it's fast

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,030
correct reliable if it would become

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,630
really a little bit really happen

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,380
5g Internet you got it guys it's rappin

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:39,140
we got this one

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:42,150
[Music]

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,830
so five G equals five grand that's my

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,180
personal favorite because I think that's

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,110
the way my mother would have answered

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,110
that question so when we look out into

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,959
the future and we're talking about 5g

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:58,650
because we see a future that is all

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,940
about data in fact of course of course

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,870
all a lot of that data will be generated

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,980
by humans where we believe that in the

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,970
next five years

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,810
over 70% of the human population will

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,820
have or use a smartphone and over 90% of

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,900
everyone over the age of six would have

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:22,380
some kind of mobile device but beyond

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,360
people the the next data revolution in

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,100
the future is really about the things in

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,650
fact by 2020

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,440
we believe that over half of all the

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,680
data that is generated on the network

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,340
will come from machines and to put that

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,730
into context if you look at a user today

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,080
you and I we generate on average about

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:48,660
one and a half gigabytes of data per day

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,120
but that pales in comparison in terms of

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,840
what a connected car will generate a

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,080
connected vehicle will generate 2,500

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,680
times as much data up to four terabytes

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
a day

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,940
a connected plane five terabytes a day

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,489
and a smart factory up to one petabytes

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,230
of data per day and one petabytes

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,570
for any of you keeping track is a

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:17,280
thousand terabytes or one quadrillion

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,350
bytes so to handle all of that data we

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,780
need a fundamental different approach in

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,960
terms of how networks are architected

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:29,460
and deployed and we believe 5g is an

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:33,090
answer to that problem looking backwards

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,610
now we see that over time there have

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,190
been innovations that have been captured

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,550
as general-purpose processing

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,229
technologies these are innovations and

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,960
inventions like the printing press and

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,870
the

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,560
and the Telegraph and the Internet all

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,599
of these are in an elite class of

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,669
socio-economic mainstream technologies

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,280
known as general-purpose processing

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,840
technologies because they have been

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,150
pervasively deployed across many many

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,490
industries and they have become

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,160
catalysts for transformative changes

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,259
that raise up the level of human

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,280
productivity and improve all of our

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:14,349
lives in fact we believe that 5g has the

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,120
capacity to become one of these

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:21,250
general-purpose processing technologies

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,610
if we look at 5g and all of the

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,699
different use cases that are going to be

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,930
enabled by the increased capacity and

00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,360
coverage and distributed intelligence

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,630
across the entire spectrum of the

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,150
infrastructure we we know some of these

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,340
today some of these are yet to be

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,970
invented but they can be categorized

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,949
into three different areas the first is

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,720
massive massive machine-type

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,780
communications and these are indicative

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,030
of the types of technologies and

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,199
capabilities that are enabling the

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,320
Internet of Things

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,740
so sensor data in the smart appliances

00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,199
in your home or smart lighting and smart

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,539
infrastructure in the smart city of

00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,139
course all the infrastructure in a smart

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:11,860
factory there they don't require large

00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:14,169
amounts of bandwidth and they are not

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,180
sensitive to latency but there's many

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,099
many millions of these sensors that need

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,990
to be aggregated and where you can

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:23,159
collect data and I turn that into

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,139
valuable insights and information a

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:29,289
second use case is enhanced mobile

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,990
broadband in fact many of the trials

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:35,500
that we're participating in today are

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,650
under this category of capability the 5g

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,870
tech forum with Verizon is focused on

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,419
not just the immersive experiences

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,150
you're trying to enable in the home but

00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,500
that last mile that last few hundred

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,659
yards or a few hundred meters of

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,759
connectivity that's what the innovations

00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:55,110
in the new wireless technology will

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,760
enable for enhanced mobile broadband and

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,220
the third category is

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,920
ultra-reliable low-latency types of use

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,960
cases and one of the best examples of

00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,780
this particular use case is the

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,680
connected car where you need a very fast

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,560
response response time when you're doing

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,050
functions like collision avoidance or

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,090
overtaking a vehicle or lane changing we

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,940
know with today's 4G network that

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,130
round-trip response time typically takes

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,830
about 15 milliseconds between the

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,190
connected car and the network but in

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:33,100
order to deliver on the collision

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,170
avoidance promise that we have with

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,990
connected cars you really need to take

00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,780
that down to three milliseconds and with

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,540
5g that response time is actually

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:49,900
shortened down to just one millisecond

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:53,050
with 99.99% reliability so if we look at

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,880
then what is fundamentally different

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,370
about the network infrastructure that's

00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,670
needed to support these very broad and

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,620
varying use cases we know that we need a

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,660
different approach to the network

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,040
architecture we need a network

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,890
infrastructure that is much more

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,170
intelligent not just in the core but in

00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,940
the edge and in the axis of the network

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,830
with distributed intelligent

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,340
programmable and scalable capabilities

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:20,880
through that spectrum of infrastructure

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,080
we also know that when we introduce

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,420
programmable computing in parts of the

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,120
network that never existed before you're

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,370
able then to harness a lot of the data

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,500
that you collect and turn that into

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,870
valuable information that you can then

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,370
monetize and where you can create new

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,290
services that are available both

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,930
upstream to the content providers and

00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:43,360
also downstream to the consumers of that

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:47,320
data whether they're people or they're

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,230
things and of course open source and

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,080
open standards really represent a

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,270
critical capability of accelerating that

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,880
distributed intelligent network

00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,680
architecture because open source and

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,860
open standards lowers the barriers to

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:07,279
entry accelerates the pace of innovation

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:10,310
it allows us to have many more new

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:15,019
cases and capabilities and overall more

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:17,120
choice and lower cost in the market so

00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:20,389
let me step through a few of the use

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,300
cases that are being enabled today by

00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:26,420
this intelligent infrastructure and that

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,300
will be enhanced by 5g and we'll start

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,300
with drones in the access network and I

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,759
love drones drones are fun but they're

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,779
also quite useful today they're used for

00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:40,819
photography and surveying their use for

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:43,910
inspections and they're even used to

00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:46,819
create an on-the-fly cellular

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,199
transmission capability so imagine a

00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:51,199
natural disaster where your

00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:53,389
infrastructure is wiped out you can

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:55,879
actually recreate that infrastructure

00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:58,449
that wireless access capability through

00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:03,680
a drone network in fact this is being

00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:06,889
trialed today by a tea in a example or

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,920
in a technology called cell on wings or

00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:13,819
cow so there's a flying cow in this in

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,069
this environment but if you look beyond

00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:18,379
some of the things that we're doing for

00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:20,389
future in the future in terms of

00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:22,100
wireless tower inspections and and just

00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:24,740
this recreation of a cellular

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,509
infrastructure we can look at some of

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,879
the examples that are happening in the

00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:32,860
enterprise we've been working with

00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:36,110
Airbus and Airbus provides a number of

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,879
aircraft inspections clearly for for

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,790
their aircraft throughout the year and

00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:44,029
typically this is the job of two people

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:47,000
hoisted on cherry pickers that inspect

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:50,420
that airplane end-to-end and that

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,329
process takes about two hours with a

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,850
drone that process only takes 15 minutes

00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:59,240
but you have added capabilities with a

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,519
drone because you can begin to collect

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,429
data on those inspections and build a

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,699
database of flaws and faults and

00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:10,639
diagnosis of problems with with

00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:13,329
airplanes and be able to test what you

00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,069
see with the 360 cameras on the drone

00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:20,250
with the database that is stored back in

00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:22,470
the cloud and that combination of local

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,010
value creation local data collection

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:28,620
that whole inference capability that is

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,050
provided by the drone locally and then

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,050
the scoring capability that happens in

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,770
the cloud is an example of where

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,430
artificial intelligence and machine

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:41,010
learning is being used to to increase

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:45,030
and improve a capability that today

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:47,490
takes humans to do in fact one of the

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:50,310
other ways that this helps the industry

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,740
is that Airbus has found this to be such

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,840
a great improvement in efficiency and

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,960
data collection that they are also now

00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,760
providing this as a service to other

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,420
airline companies or aircraft companies

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,400
and so they see an opportunity to turn

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:10,470
valuable data into services and

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:13,560
monetization opportunities when we look

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:16,650
at 5g intelligence in the edge of the

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:21,600
network we look at retail as another

00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:24,300
example retailers today have a lot of

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,520
challenges of course competing with or

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,010
complementing the online retail

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,870
experience but one of the biggest

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,960
problems they have is in something

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:38,640
called inventory distortion and this is

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:40,770
the the ability to accurately to assess

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,050
what their inventory position is and to

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,910
avoid stock outs or over stocks or

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,210
something they call shrinkage which is

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,330
really just a nice word for theft so

00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,130
when you look at this inventory

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,620
distortion problem it represents over 1

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,080
trillion dollars of negative impact in

00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,570
terms of retailers globally and in the

00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,880
US alone that shrinkage or that fifth

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,520
problem represents about 42 billion

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,310
dollars of negative impact because you

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,390
can't you can't trace or track what is

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,510
actually happening with your inventory

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:17,490
we know that with 5g technology and with

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,740
sensor data and RFID and NFC

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,380
communications that you can improve that

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,570
accuracy of your inventory up to

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:28,320
virtually a hundred percent and with

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,970
every three percent improvement in your

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,380
knowledge and assessment of your

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,920
inventory of true inventory position

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:38,110
you actually increase revenue by 1%

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,880
today the the best that you can get and

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,600
most retailers are somewhere between 65

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,520
and 70% accuracy but again with 5g

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,210
technology we see that increasing to

00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,070
almost a hundred percent of the accurate

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,830
information around urban inventory

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,020
position and then you extend that beyond

00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,610
just the inventory to the actual

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,510
experience that you're trying to enable

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,590
with the user coming into the store

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:06,250
immersive experience is where you can

00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:09,070
try on different different outfits and

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:13,090
see how they look on you virtually in in

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:15,750
a mirror you can also just track the

00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,620
behavior of the consumer suggest

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,440
complimentary items to the things that

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,000
they've selected and collect data to try

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,460
to ensure that you have the right

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,800
products that satisfy your your users in

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:31,750
that store at any point in time moving

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,030
to the core of the network and greater

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,940
intelligence their event is a great

00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:39,460
example of a use case that we're

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,850
enabling through technology and that 5g

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:46,600
enhances so today at events and concerts

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:49,440
we know that the distribution of the

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,230
data and the load on the network is very

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,240
it's very spiky and and if you look at

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,790
something like the Super Bowl the high

00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,180
peak traffic for content actually isn't

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:04,480
for touchdowns it is during the halftime

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,380
show when you see people taking selfies

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,680
and photos and videos and uploading the

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:14,470
the Beyonce halftime show the Lady Gaga

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:17,020
halftime show what what that represents

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,540
to the network provider is of course a

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,580
great load on their network and one of

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,500
the ways are overcoming that is by

00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,210
bringing more intelligence to the edge

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,790
of the network from the core and

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:31,060
extending that capability and building a

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,910
cloud ram capability that now allows you

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,270
to cache content locally and to be able

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,760
to satisfy the users experience without

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:43,190
the backhaul costs and latency that you

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,050
would normally incur with 5g the

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,860
capacity coverage increases anywhere

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,149
from 100 to 5,000 times and it does so

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,829
in a way that is much more

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,750
cost-effective again bringing that

00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:56,240
intelligence from the core to the edge

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,860
to the access network and having a

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,410
consistent architecture by which you

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:05,959
deliver these new experiences to all of

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:08,120
the users exactly the same time finally

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,040
you can't talk about next generation

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,839
networks and network requirements

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,180
without talking about video video is

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,730
that workload that every single network

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,069
operator has to contend with it

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,519
represents over 80% of all the data

00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:26,120
traffic at peak times over 75% of video

00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,189
traffic and over 60% of the traffic

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,850
that's generated by the Internet of

00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:34,120
Things and increasingly that video

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,279
experience is becoming more immersive

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,769
through experiences like augmented

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,750
reality and virtual reality or even

00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:44,629
merge reality the idea that you would

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,579
place a physical object in a virtual

00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:50,180
world or a virtual object in your

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:53,389
physical world this requires a lot of

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,689
flow latency of processing and large

00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:59,829
amounts of bandwidth and you see 3d

00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:02,959
experiences with VR glasses or

00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:04,610
experiences that are enabled by facebook

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,919
360 or Google Streetview

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:09,140
all of these requiring much more

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,539
immersive much higher bandwidth and much

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:17,959
lower latency to deliver to the end user

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:22,100
experience so Intel's view is that 5g

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:24,220
truly is an end-to-end opportunity where

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,500
you have distributed intelligent

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,570
programmable networking from the device

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,520
through the access through the core and

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:36,320
up into a cloud and it's a circular a

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,960
cycle of goodness in terms of the

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,030
content creation the ingestion into the

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,850
network the processing in the cloud and

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:48,110
then back out to deliver that experience

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:51,440
to the users and in that Stadium example

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,960
we know that for example in the Olympics

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,210
that we're looking at for 2018 and 2020

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,700
some of the Opera

00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,669
exist to actually create a virtual

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:04,450
ticket to an event and have a courtside

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:07,450
view to the actual race or competition

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,330
or match when you are half a world away

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:15,309
all of that requires innovations that 5g

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:17,590
is enabling so when you look at all of

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:19,450
those varying use cases and all of the

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,299
different capabilities that we need to

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,279
deliver from a network infrastructure we

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:28,120
know that we need an infrastructure that

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,809
is highly composable that can actually

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,340
create on the fly in real time an

00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:36,789
experience that is tailored to that end

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,580
user or that end use case without over

00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:41,770
provisioning of the network resources or

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,260
under provisioning and then impacting

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,990
the quality of experience and those will

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,779
vary greatly in just the examples I gave

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,419
from high bandwidth to low latency low

00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:54,250
energy that you need low bandwidth for

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:56,740
the inner things and then the ultra high

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,559
bandwidth examples of video immersive

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:03,520
video and of course connected cars all

00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:05,559
of that capability with a logical slice

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,600
being served up by the network that is

00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:11,260
highly tailored and highly tuned to that

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,960
particular use case and of course what

00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,080
we we need here is not just the resource

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,360
orchestration but actually the services

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,480
orchestration to manage all of that

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,460
capability and here to share a little

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,250
bit more of their insights on the

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,289
network of the future and how 5g meets

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,830
them one of those requirements is chris

00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,779
rice

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:37,889
senior vice president of ATT claps

00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:41,849
please welcome Chris hi Chris

00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:44,589
so I've talked a lot by 5g and I already

00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:47,169
so and I wanted to ask well how does 18

00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:49,089
TC 5g and the next generation networks

00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:51,399
impacting your capabilities and what

00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:54,309
you're offering to your customers so

00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:59,079
think of it as we're creating a VIP

00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:03,609
network VIP VIP virtual intelligent and

00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:05,619
programmable VIPs not exclusive to VIPs

00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:08,289
but virtual intelligent programmable and

00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:11,469
so for us you know we have at the core

00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:13,419
now tens of millions of mobile

00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:16,419
subscribers on a virtual Evolved Packet

00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:18,039
core that's already happening now at the

00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:19,779
edge we're seeing these low latency

00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,609
latency use cases that you talked about

00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,440
driving you know more compute more

00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:26,049
intelligence at the edge which again you

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,719
just discussed and in both at the edge

00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:30,519
and in the core you know what's really

00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:32,169
key is open interfaces because those

00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,329
open interfaces allow us to get data

00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:35,859
allow us to do analytics and it drives

00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:39,509
an unprecedented amount of automation

00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:42,219
into our network going forward so open

00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:44,139
open source made some big announcements

00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:46,059
recently right tell us a little bit more

00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:48,190
about what you think onap will deliver

00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,629
not just ATT but really to the industry

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,719
at large and I promise you I'd be

00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:55,869
briefed on this so yeah you know onap is

00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:58,269
a Linux Foundation project it's a

00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:01,479
combination a harmonization of what we

00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:04,839
were doing in open source ecomp in open

00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:07,329
o today the service providers that are

00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,889
members of own app account for about 38

00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:11,169
percent of the worldwide mobile subs so

00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:14,739
about 1.8 billion there's more on the

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:18,219
way in fact we have 27 members now and

00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:22,950
we had five new members just this week

00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:27,429
let's see wind river siena reliance geo

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,989
Microsoft and we even had the open

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:32,109
networking forum joining right I mean so

00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:33,999
that's a very diverse group and I think

00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:35,529
the open networking forum is really

00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,579
interesting in the sense that and we

00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,529
talked about this on your panel the

00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:40,389
other day of kind of driving a directed

00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:41,859
innovation and so I think that

00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:43,389
harmonization that we wanted to do is

00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:47,759
paying off because you know just like

00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:49,690
iOS and Android became de facto

00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,369
operating systems for the mobile phone

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,709
we'd like to see own app become the

00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:55,539
de-facto network operating system for

00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:58,839
Sdn automation and so we think that's a

00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:01,690
really good harbinger of that invitation

00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:03,700
to join yes so let me ask you finally

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,679
then when you look at that Ryo

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,859
architecture of the network

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,129
what role does data analytics play in

00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:15,639
terms of either ways to lower costs or

00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:17,649
perhaps to become a vehicle monetization

00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:19,029
for new services yes I think if you

00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,859
think about analytics you got to go two

00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:22,869
steps back because analytics really

00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,519
requires data and data requires open

00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:25,659
interfaces and so I've said that a lot

00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,239
but I'm gonna say it again for emphasis

00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:29,859
they're really the key for for us in

00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:32,469
analytics and data is open interfaces

00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:34,899
and that's open interfaces at the edge

00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:36,099
and at the core and you know really to

00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:37,869
be honest with you that what we're

00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:41,279
trying to do is get more and more

00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:45,549
capability to be able to you know

00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,989
collect analyze and act on data and once

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,219
you can do that you can learn from it

00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:50,289
that's where the machine learning comes

00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:52,629
in and once you can learn from it that

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:53,919
jar is literally a whole new level of

00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:56,049
automation something we call hyper

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,139
automation so totally changes the way we

00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:01,450
run and manage our networks and so is 5g

00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:04,599
and the foundations of 5g happening now

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,549
at 18 Chi and and is that really part of

00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,749
the journey that we're on in terms of

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,950
the network transformation thank you

00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:11,049
yeah you know I like the way you

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,789
described it that you know when people

00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,079
buy that first phone and it's a 5 g

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:16,209
phone they kind of feel like that's the

00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,739
first day but you know there was a lot

00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:18,940
of work going on right you know just

00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:21,969
like when the baby arrives there was a

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,349
lot of work right before that so you

00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,759
know we're we're excited about that and

00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:26,200
yeah we're well on our way and we

00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,749
certainly thank you and others for the

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:37,059
help and making that happen

00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:39,219
there you go take care so from a

00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,559
management and orchestration perspective

00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:44,829
clearly we have a lot of work to do but

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:46,539
we are well underway with own app and

00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:48,759
with other open source networking

00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:53,289
projects in fact two that I wanted to

00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:56,559
call out here today is DP DK and OPN EFI

00:23:53,289 --> 00:24:00,369
so DP DK the data plane development kit

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,430
is a set of optimized libraries and

00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:05,420
device drivers

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:07,130
that Intel invented back in 2010 and

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,350
this is to provide high performance

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,530
packet processing functions on

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,600
general-purpose CPUs so function is

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,630
queue and buffer management and quality

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,790
of service flow classification all of

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,410
these functions that you can run on your

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,870
general purpose CPU that's probably

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,880
running already in your server platform

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:30,080
of the application and the control plane

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,060
functions until invented it in 2010 it

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,220
was actually one of the key enabling

00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,690
technologies that was included in the

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,720
original Etsy MFE white paper in 2012 we

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:44,540
open sourced it through DP DK org in

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,700
2013 and over the years have added multi

00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,010
architecture and multi vendor support

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,380
and earlier this week on Monday Jim's

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,720
Emlyn announced that DVD K will now be

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,490
hosted in the Linux Foundation as a way

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,010
to broaden the community of developers

00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:00,440
that are contributing to this innovation

00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:03,430
so we're very excited about a DB DK now

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,990
being hosted by the Linux Foundation

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,020
another big announcement that we made

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:13,160
just yesterday is with OPN fe or the

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,350
open platform for NF e so OPN F V is an

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,780
open source project that brings together

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,520
all of the elements that you need to

00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,820
deliver and accelerate the

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,120
commercialization of NF e solutions in

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,530
the market we are on our fourth release

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,960
where two and a half years old but this

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,690
was our fourth major release and we work

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,940
upstream with with the upstream

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,150
communities like OpenStack and ODL and

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,250
OVS and then of course we work within

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,440
the project to harden a lot of the

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,740
capabilities to automate functions of

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,690
nfe onboarding to include capabilities

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,790
in this latest release for a faster data

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:53,030
path through the integration of the

00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:54,950
phyto stack and also some key features

00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,590
that we've introduced like service

00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:00,550
function chaining and support for ipv6

00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:03,050
so open AV is a catalyst to accelerate

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:06,290
the network transformation which of

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:13,309
course NFV and SDM are a critical part

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:17,019
of so in summary 5g is happening now

00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:19,490
this idea of an intelligent scalable

00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:21,499
programmable Network from the core to

00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,019
the access to the edge is indeed the

00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:26,929
hallmark of what work we're driving in

00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:28,700
network transformation and in fact when

00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:31,129
you have that programmable computing

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,529
capability in all areas of your

00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:35,870
infrastructure you're able to provide

00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:38,570
data analytics and turn so much of that

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,730
data into valuable services that you can

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:43,639
monetize with your upstream customers

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,460
and your downstream customers open

00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:49,759
source and open standards all of you are

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:52,429
a critical element and accelerator to

00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:55,159
that 5g vision and on behalf of Intel I

00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:57,889
invite all of you to join with us to

00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:05,090
accelerate the 5g future and deliver on

00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:08,470
the promise of 5g thank you and I think

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:11,210
we have time for a few questions yes so

00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,909
if you have a few questions I think

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,190
there's mics in the audience there's one

00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:18,769
right there good morning hi good morning

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,350
cliff Grossinger I H s market just one

00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:24,409
question I'm wondering if you have any

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:27,740
thoughts about hardware accelerators for

00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:30,379
machine learning in AI and did those

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,139
find them said do these find themselves

00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:34,190
way into this network yes that's an

00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:36,350
excellent question

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,139
hardware acceleration is a way to

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:43,190
perform very very fast deterministic

00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:47,029
functions a highly cost effective in a

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:51,559
low-power way and they can take on any

00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:53,240
number of forms within a CPU or chipset

00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:55,340
a lot of the technology that we provide

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,679
to the market we have crypto and

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,149
compression capabilities for for

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,700
hardware acceleration that we integrate

00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:03,889
into the standard platform with the

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,600
common tool chain and all of the the

00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:07,039
capabilities that the ecosystem and the

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,610
developers have to take advantage of

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,889
that but beyond that we know that Asics

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,600
actually provide a lot of excellent

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:17,389
functionality and Intel made an

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,980
investment in an ASIC company that

00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:19,999
specializes in artificial intelligence

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,799
nirvana

00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:23,570
and that we are integrating that now

00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,179
into our tool chain so that you have

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,070
that same interface whether it's running

00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:29,320
natively

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,830
CPU through hardware accelerator blocks

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,740
there or in an ASIC and then finally

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,600
FPGA is another way that we can provide

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,659
hardware acceleration an FPGA is in

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,850
particular are very valuable in the

00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:46,269
wireless network infrastructure because

00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,559
so many of the standards and so many of

00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:49,419
those networking stacks and particularly

00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,700
in the case of 5g are evolving over time

00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:53,500
and so FPGA gives you that program

00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,169
ability but the key here and certainly

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,870
Intel strategy is to provide a common

00:28:56,169 --> 00:29:00,820
programming interface so that the

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,470
developers themselves don't don't

00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,659
necessarily have to care how that

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,179
hardware acceleration is delivered

00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:09,429
whether it's in the cpu in the FPGA or

00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:11,500
in the ASIC it's a common interface and

00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:13,139
allows them to develop solutions much

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,809
more quickly

00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:18,309
alessandra don't talk just a bit of

00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:20,230
information really that there is there

00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:23,529
is a another joint operator white paper

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,330
that on 5g which was published in in

00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,710
February which outlines what the

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,710
operators considered to be the

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,360
priorities for nfe to support 5g so they

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,610
includes things like network slicing and

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,379
cloud native design so that's available

00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,279
and then fact I'm talking about about

00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,049
that tomorrow morning

00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,429
and then the second thing about open

00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:42,730
standards collaboration is that we've

00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:46,240
just finished an Etsy NFV joint session

00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:50,200
with the 3gpp sa-2 which is about trying

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:53,350
to align the 3gpp network architecture

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,029
to consume the NFV stuff that we've been

00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,350
developing over the last four years just

00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:58,480
a bit of information I know this is

00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,850
mainly an open source software group so

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,590
of course I also welcome the the open

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,509
source people participating in that

00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,429
collaboration as well well actually it's

00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:08,620
a it's a valuable comment on because we

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,409
see an increasing interdependence e

00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,850
between open source and open standards

00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:16,000
one helping the other two really go

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,559
faster so thank you ok I think we're out

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,750
of time thank you so much have a good

00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:23,049
day

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,049
