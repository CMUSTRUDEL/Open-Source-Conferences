hi everybody hopefully you'll enjoy the

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,740
presentations today I know at the end of

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,070
the day and thank you for staying awake

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,269
for it yes last year I was here and we

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,549
talked a little bit we started to talk

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,650
about how Equinix is starting to think

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,660
about open source ecosystem and what we

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,270
need to do and what I'd like to do today

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,090
is just give you an update of where we

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,160
are and what we think that looks like

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,859
this is a journey for a lot of us of how

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,970
we build the next generation

00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:32,610
architecture for data centers & networks

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,320
and I feel really good about the fact

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,800
that we're making tremendous progress as

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,210
a community and as an industry and let

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,629
me share with you some of the thoughts

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,820
we have so first of all I think you know

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,530
Equinix but we are global data center

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,750
company with a multi-tenant data center

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,940
company so we have the biggest clouds

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,000
and networks and financial services and

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,550
enterprises all come in we continue to

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,210
expand the platform we have we're going

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,129
to have / 179 data centers with the vice

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,500
and acquisition that we announced by

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,110
sometime in the second quarter and we

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,610
have more and more market expanded so we

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,590
feel really fortunate that we have a

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,600
global platform to deploy so anything I

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,549
tell you about is something we will make

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,140
available across the globe which is

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,180
critical for any kind of deployment to

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,280
be able to have global each so we're

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,640
going to be in 43 markets around the

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,320
world and and I think that gets the vast

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,549
majority of where the places people want

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,100
to go so what is this aggregation for us

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,869
so for us this aggregation is we want to

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,299
enable the ecosystem that's showing up

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,220
here in a lot of places the significant

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,159
announcement everywhere you go this this

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,020
this time almost every weeks is a new

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,180
announcement a new hardware open-source

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,740
ecosystem a new switch or new

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,290
disaggregation option as well as

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,180
software new open source software we

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,950
call it this aggregation and I think you

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,299
know that term very well it's you want

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,060
to be able to make the hardware

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,890
innovation and interchangeability of

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,680
open source independent from the

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,689
software and support both for most

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,460
companies who talk to you they would

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,810
have picked one software or one hard

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,729
work platform because they're building

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,289
one network the challenge for us is to

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,239
be able to support dozens of those

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,410
because everybody who comes in have

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,000
already and

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,710
the end controller or they have a

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,900
hardware option and we need to be able

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,510
to make that available so we can open up

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,070
the community for these people so first

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,420
of all we are a member of tip the

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,480
telecom infrastructure project

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,910
especially in the open optical packet

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,230
transport I myself share that with with

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,970
hans jürgen and then we we do have we

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,210
really focused on high speed data center

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,400
interconnect and we have tested the open

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,330
optical white boxes and switches i'm

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,100
going to tell you a little bit about

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:49,710
that we we are looking at open network

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,600
switches and the programmability program

00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,160
abetik control of all the inter

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,980
connection and outing via API

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,630
integration and in terms of hardware we

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,020
want to enable the ocp data center

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,150
infrastructure and since since they'd is

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,100
next after me we also probably want to

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,930
enable the open 19 and he asked me to

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:11,130
say this I just want to let you know so

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,720
we the point is that it's not just one

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,740
ecosystem we're starting with ocp and

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,530
the ecosystem but we're going to

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,000
continue to add more and we will

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,310
continue to participate and hardware

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,050
software disaggregation an ecosystem

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,700
development just like ons here we see it

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:29,700
as one of the key places so this is what

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,740
the architecture looks like for us we

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,990
what we want to be able to do is test

00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,270
and enable both open source hardware and

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,220
software at the same time and allow

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,410
multiple vendors to happen so in the

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,050
case of the hardware we're starting with

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,840
the open naqvi to from ocp so we can

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,970
support compute and storage and the

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,910
wedge 100 is the one we're using for the

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,850
networking we use the backpack also from

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,770
the open optical innovation and the

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,660
voyager switch is the one we were

00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,280
testing at this time so these are the

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,489
ones we have but we're going to add more

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,140
to them and what we want to do is enable

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,940
this architecture and multiple data

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,590
center and continue to test the

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,709
connectivity between them back and forth

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,320
so the idea here is that not just we

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,290
have the ocp hard when open XV too but

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,400
things like open 19 and others and

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,440
people who have different hardware

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,400
modules can come in and be able to put

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,229
them in and see all the different

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,870
hardware Howard how it's set up so

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,610
servers from multiple providers storage

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,439
for multiple providers Network liquid

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,750
meant for many vendors and we have

00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,729
hundreds of them making it now as the

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,110
same with the optical switching and all

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:39,780
the software in terms of the open switch

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,939
router and what we feel is what we're

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,789
championing in terms of opening in s and

00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:47,669
flexibility here is what we what we are

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:49,500
after is to have a the ability to design

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,759
the hardware and it can be any kind of

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,770
hard work depending on the application

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,719
you want with completely opened

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,539
components and then we would use that

00:04:54,719 --> 00:05:00,539
Linux open line open network Linux as

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:02,310
the kernel and be with SDKs and be able

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,650
to load different software modules on

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,270
top so like the snapper out that you

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,460
heard about from AT&T would be one that

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,560
we tested but we want to support many of

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,000
those that go in so that we're not

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,279
limiting ourselves to a single software

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,620
or single function and through this

00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,849
architecture we see the ability of all

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,300
the different functions to work together

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,560
so when through the SDK and the API so

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,360
because that's one of the things that

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
nobody in the industry is testing how

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,270
all these different open-source software

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,919
as well as all the different option of

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,650
open hardware are going to work together

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,180
and interoperate and we'll get that lab

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,460
and make it available for people to come

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,440
in this equipment is all connected to

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,449
our internet exchanges as well as cloud

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,940
exchange so people will be able to test

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,500
against the entire war Internet of the

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,940
globe and all the connectivity and all

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,039
the cloud providers that we have in our

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,960
data centers I think this is going to be

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,669
critical in terms of enabling the open

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,740
source hardware and software and this

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,449
architecture is the one we we support

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,279
and endorse many other architectures are

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,620
good but this is the one we feel would

00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,750
scale in our world which is this

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,919
ecosystem centric multiple networks and

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,800
clouds and how they all need to be

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,279
together with many creators of hardware

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,409
options and and the way you would be

00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:14,219
able to use it with the api's you can

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:16,289
have different Sdn controllers all able

00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:17,779
to control this infrastructure and be

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,610
able to control everywhere from

00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,620
physically how the optical and Outing

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,509
comp and switching components all the

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,759
way to the different functions that

00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,460
exist in the software so you could use

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,169
owners you could use or opendaylight any

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,029
kind of SDN controller would be able to

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,219
use the S api's and control this

00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,630
infrastructure which is what we feel is

00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:38,759
going to be needed to enable this

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,510
ecosystem you would just put them

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,610
whatever use case you want your kit

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,820
module use the controllers and be able

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,050
to to enable it and these use case it

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,330
could be anything between two data

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,310
centers inside one data center you can

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,980
combine optics and routing or just

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,560
optics or switching so all the stuff in

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,910
our view this is how all the benefits of

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,010
open hardware and software becomes

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,830
available when you can do it in in an

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,720
open mod world where you could connect

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,820
to all the different internet networks

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,470
and clouds out there as the different

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,970
networks as you heard for many of them

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,920
continue to deploy the new

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,150
next-generation architecture we are

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,340
working with many of them to be

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,900
available at equinix so you could use

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:21,100
this to connect to them and connect to

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,350
multiple providers and one of the things

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,440
we just tested was the open line system

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,020
using or completely open optical

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,450
switches between two of our data centers

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,430
we did it jointly with Facebook and we

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,860
had fantastic is also the performance of

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,990
these all these open optical modules and

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,950
switches is equivalent to anything you

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,260
have there and we're going to continue

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:44,770
to test and publish what we do we talked

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,090
about this at ofc and soon enough we

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,890
will we will continue to go down the

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,540
path and we will make more announcements

00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,150
in the future when we have a lab

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,190
available for people to test against so

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,330
this is this is all I had and I want to

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,870
make more time for the next two

00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:02,050

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:07,030
questions if somebody has or pass you to

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,190
