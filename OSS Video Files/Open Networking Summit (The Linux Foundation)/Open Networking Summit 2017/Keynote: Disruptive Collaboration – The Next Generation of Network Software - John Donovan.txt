	00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:05,819
good morning everybody always great to

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,580
come out and see this crowd it's

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,179
interesting the size of the crowd has

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,130
grown but the depth of the undertaking

00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:17,240
gets better every year as we move from

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,570
concept and powerpoints to prototypes to

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,880
production so a lot of folks are going

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,220
to talk today and in the next few days

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,320
about the evolution of where things are

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,869
headed where things are are as an

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,660
industry what we wanted to do today for

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,989
the AT&T portion of the program is lay

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,910
out some specifics of how we think about

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:44,329
software-defined networking the open

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,570
source component of it and what our

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:51,510
explicit roadmap is designed to do and

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,270
so what I wanted to do first well thank

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,370
you are paid for in the introduction

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,309
there is very kind of you

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,420
we have a great team on which I rely so

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,250
what I want to do is to tell you how we

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,380
think about the evolution of our network

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,920
we and in the mobile part of our

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,700
business as we roll out technologies we

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,150
would go from 2g to 3G to 4G and and

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,259
what we realize is we go to five g 5g

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,900
will be the first time that something is

00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:27,390
born in a modern architecture and there

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,170
were always compromises with us at AT&T

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,820
and in how we did things and so what we

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,280
did is we wanted to go back and look and

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,860
say okay well if if software-defined

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,860
networking is what we're about today

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,140
then what's next and what is our network

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,479
of the future and what I laid out here

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,579
is a simple schematic for how we think

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,829
about things in what we called our

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,290
domain one program our legacy

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,869
environment what we used to do is single

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,520
vendor optimization frankly we were just

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,680
a good supply chain we were good at

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,200
understanding the field of use and how

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,890
we're going to apply something and our

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,320
job was to specify and purchase it no

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,899
more that was a very difficult task we

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,150
could feel like industry leaders but our

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,400
job was to specify and then we went into

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,750
this this next

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,829
wave of networking where I remember in

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,030
2009 we got into this multi-vendor

00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:25,849
optimization and we called that program

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:30,829
domain 2 it's really that our first

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:33,980
modern kick at at work our role had the

00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:35,299
switch to being an integrator and if we

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,150
were going to do this effectively at

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:42,140
AT&T we had to build the skills to be

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,810
able to integrate frankly in hindsight

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,519
that looks very easy but at the time we

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,099
were extremely nervous as to whether we

00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,370
had the competency to deal with all of

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:55,010
the complexity of the the service

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,989
chaining of virtualization of figuring

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,750
out how to move from that appliance

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,090
world into the complexity of more of a

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,790
systems world and then we got into

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,489
network to where we had to shift from

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,530
being an integration leader to being the

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,849
architect so in software-defined

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,889
networking and I don't need to tell

00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:16,159
anybody in this room where the state of

00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,930
that was five six years ago we had to

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,269
take on the role of architect we had to

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,239
take the risk that came with being first

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:25,760
going into undefined territory and then

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,220
what we started to do was ensure that

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,540
that not only did we think about every

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,010
element of the network and decompose our

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,290
traditional network into network

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,109
functions there were approximately 300

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,599
Network functions we had to virtualize

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:44,120
those and then we had to move them into

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,620
a multi-tenant environment and so you

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,560
know a little bit because we're very

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,729
public in our internal metrics that we

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,799
wanted to get software-defined

00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:55,340
networking to 5% of the network

00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:59,650
functions we made six last year we set a

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:02,090
target for 30 we hit well over 30% and

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:06,560
this year we said we would take that

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,239
number to 55% but when we get to 55%

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,819
there's no turning back

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,579
you're more software-defined then you're

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,919
not software-defined and you when you

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:19,549
hit that tipping point you start to say

00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,440
ok now what now what do we do when we

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:23,659
have a software-defined network and how

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,180
do we capitalize on it and that's when

00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:26,790
we looked and said ok the future of our

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,280
network

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,830
is not just about the architecture but

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,930
once it's built how do we leverage that

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,310
and that's where we came with what we

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,560
call our network 300 which is a data

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,010
powered network if we do this correctly

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,230
and we decompose our network into their

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,090
primary functions and those functions

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:54,420
are properly built we have a vociferous

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:58,230
capability to get gather data out of our

00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,840
network to go into a loop to build

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,820
automation and machine learning that

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,920
allows our network to be the best that

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,110
it's capable of not only for how we

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,420
build networks but for how we

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,760
authenticate customers onto the network

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,580
how we deal with threats on our network

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,580
and so all of those traditional services

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,490
that used to sit outside of traditional

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,340
networking now become part of networking

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:27,030
and so our role in this data powered

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,910
environment is shifts to being a

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,830
differentiator I mean we really have to

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,540
understand how to use our data and

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,000
that's where we came up with the

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,280
platform concept of indigo indigo is

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,200
really taking a page out of the software

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,980
folks whether it's the Android folks

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,540
naming after deserts our logo color is

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,970
blue and we've said okay we're going to

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,970
start to launch platforms in colors of

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,650
blue so indigo is our first

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,870
instantiation of a software driven

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,880
platform and so if you think about

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:01,140
things in moving from traditional

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,170
networking to this new world indigo is

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,450
an abstraction layer that sits on top of

00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,340
traditional networking so we have

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,010
software-defined networking that's a

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,600
function that are that's a capability in

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,450
our network that will be true of

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,120
everything we do this this year our

00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,430
targets to get to 55% we're going to

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,280
evolve our raw network technology for

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,410
access so the next trick in Wireless is

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,630
5g but we're going to evolve everything

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:33,750
we do to 5g capabilities 5g speed 5g

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,460
software-defined architectures and then

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,530
the third and important element is how

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,350
do you leverage that data power to

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,740
create data powered everything

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,160
so what we're architecting today is the

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,630
abstraction layer that sits on top of

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,630
access technology software-defined

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:53,150
networking and the data that flows

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:56,300
around our network indigo is that

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,130
abstraction platform that indigo will

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,500
evolve and accelerate over time just

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:04,130
like your phone's operating system did

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,790
so as you think about own app and the

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:11,300
network operating system indigo is the

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:15,260
how that gets manifested into customer

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,120
into services and performance and so to

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,740
talk about some of the specifics and to

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,770
make some announcements today I want to

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,080
call up AT&T s chief technology officer

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:32,330
Andre foolish and Andre will come and

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:39,710
take indigo a layer deeper all right

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:41,480
good morning great to see you all so you

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,930
know I can't think of a more exciting

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,850
time to be part of networking and I hope

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,980
you're excited too in fact I talked to

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,870
my 11 year old daughter this morning she

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,510
says what are you doing this morning I'm

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,790
saying I'm giving a talk to a bunch of

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,710
network folks she said that sounds

00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,230
pretty boring I said these are the folks

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,240
that are going to change the way you use

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:06,320
your smart phone and she says that

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:10,280
sounds pretty cool so I can't tell you

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,500
how excited I am about where we are in

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,240
this place and time in terms of where

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,190
networking is going it's it's really

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,890
networking's era and really the role

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,270
that many of you play and I know many of

00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:27,920
you are in different parts of this

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:30,190
ecosystem will really not just impact

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,830
you know the various industries we serve

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,940
but really impact the world and you're

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,719
really going to be part of something

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,810
special here so this this is more about

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,290
you know taking network to a whole new

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:49,940
powerful impactful level that we've

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:51,890
never seen before and at AT&T you know

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,190
we're really excited to be taking this

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,339
journey with you

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,670
and you know if you think back you know

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,639
Martin talked about you know ten years

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:06,389
ago where he started on this journey and

00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:10,050
for us at AT&T you know the real trigger

00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:11,399
point for us was also ten years ago and

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:17,069
that was the launch of the first iPhone

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:21,600
and in fact when you look from 2007 on

00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:25,040
how much our network how much demand has

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,939
hit our network it has grown over

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,180
250,000 percent in the last ten years

00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:36,089
it's pretty staggering and what we

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,579
quickly realized was the approach we've

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:41,579
been taking for many many decades a very

00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,540
hardware centric approach just wasn't

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:45,689
going to cut it anymore

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,990
and we realized that shifting to

00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:53,310
software was our best bet to meet this

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,199
accelerating demand we also realized

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,439
that if we're going to become a software

00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:02,189
company we really needed a new

00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:05,670
architecture and we really needed a new

00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:07,800
platform but when we looked around at

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,810
that time there really wasn't anything

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,490
off-the-shelf that fit so we decided

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,019
well what do you do you can't find it

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:24,240
around somewhere else you go and build

00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:25,220
it yourself and so we decided to build

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,279
ecomp

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,860
now ecomp isn't some ecommerce platform

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:35,610
or some sort of executive compensation

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:38,279
system ecomp is really a model driven

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:43,290
network operating system for Sdn

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:45,990
automation it's highly modular it's very

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:50,160
scalable and of course it's reliable and

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:55,110
secure and we have it running in our own

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,059
80 integrated cloud we've had ecomp in

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,389
production now for over two and a half

00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:03,509
years it represents about eight and a

00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:06,060
half million lines of code it's

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:10,200
supporting well over a hundred

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:13,380
print virtual network functions at all

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,280
layers of our network serving all levels

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:20,970
of customers and to give you a couple

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,900
examples we have it running operating

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:28,950
and supporting our mobility network

00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:33,360
where every voice over LTE call is part

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:36,690
partly managed by ecomp where we have

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,710
our mobile packet core we have tens of

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:44,340
millions of subscribers again being

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,660
supported by ecomp we also have ecomp

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,020
supporting our enterprise business

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,270
customers with one of our products our

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,000
network on demand product called flex

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:57,270
where where our enterprise customers can

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,720
basically pull virtual network network

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,880
functions onto their premises and manage

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,130
them as well as manage their bandwidth

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,480
dynamically through our network so

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:13,110
pretty powerful we also have ecomp

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,110
supporting how our optical transport

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,970
network operates so all the various

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,890
wavelengths that we switch across the

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:26,370
country are now part of Sdn and ecomp

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:29,490
control in doing all this you know we

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,200
talked a lot about it publicly and we

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,760
also notice that other operators were

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,590
very interested in what we were doing

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:40,980
too so last year a little over a year

00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:44,940
ago we released the white paper about

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:48,510
ecomp in fact John Donovan stood on this

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,690
very stage a year ago and put out a call

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,460
to all of you in the industry to say

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,840
please download this and let us know

00:12:53,460 --> 00:13:00,090
what you think and we got tremendous

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:03,390
feedback in fact we had over 7,000

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:06,330
downloads of that white paper and we had

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:09,860
a tremendous amount of interest not just

00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:13,320
from other mobile operators but really

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:16,110
many different parts of the industry

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,970
very interested in what ecomp has to

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,280
offer

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:23,450
so last summer after all this feedback

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:28,560
we decided to make a pretty big step and

00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:30,090
that was to open-source ecomp so we

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,950
worked with the great folks here at the

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:35,520
Linux Foundation to figure out a plan

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:42,270
how to roll this out and earlier this

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:44,400
year we released open source ecomp while

00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:48,030
we were doing this we realized there was

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,830
an even bigger opportunity and the

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,920
bigger opportunity was to really work

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:56,280
with some other operators that had

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,370
another project going on the open OU

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:02,490
project and this was an opportunity here

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:05,520
to really sit down and create a global

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:09,120
standard an opportunity here to really

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,810
align the industry on a single

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:17,400
consolidated effort and so just recently

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:22,140
here we merged ecomp with open oh and we

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:27,600
created a new name own app open network

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:31,830
automation platform now own app we think

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:36,060
is tremendous opportunity here currently

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:40,380
as I speak here we have over seven

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:44,040
global operators representing nearly two

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:48,750
billion mobile subscribers across North

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:52,200
America Europe and Asia that's over one

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,800
third of the global mobile subscriber

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:59,760
market signed on to own app right now

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:03,120
I'm even more excited about a whole

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,730
pipeline of additional operators and

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,450
service providers that are lined up

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:11,430
representing about another third that

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,760
will be joining here in the coming

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:17,760
months so we're really excited to see

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:22,040
that own app and John talked about the

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:26,130
tipping point own app really will become

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,070
the global standard for service

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:32,860
providers to introduce and operate and

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:34,390
manage Sdn

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,940
so you can see there's a tremendous

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:40,120
amount of momentum building here but the

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:44,440
onap community is more than just telcos

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:48,490
and vendors we also see many web and

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:51,460
cloud companies and integrators very

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,710
interested in joining as well in fact

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,680
just announced Microsoft just came on

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,890
board so we're pretty excited about that

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:03,280
also so own app is really about many

00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:05,050
things but what's most important I would

00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,230
say is it's really about working

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,450
together as a as a common aligned

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,930
community here to innovate and deploy

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:16,660
faster it's about working together to

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:20,440
build new things and not the same things

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:24,670
twice so I've talked a lot about how

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:28,120
important open software is but guess

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,750
what open hardware is just as important

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,620
too so let me talk a little bit about an

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:36,310
announcement we just released this

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:39,600
morning that we're very excited about so

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:43,480
this morning we put out a press release

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,510
where we announced a very successful

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,930
trial what we believe a first in the

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:54,820
telecom industry where we put together a

00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,580
set of light boxes consisting of

00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:02,970
multiple suppliers disruptive suppliers

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:05,920
and a lot of open source capability

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,700
carrying customer traffic from coast to

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,980
coast so what did we do here

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:14,740
we collaborated directly with three

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:19,000
merchant silicon providers barefoot

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,530
networks Broadcom and Intel and we

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,860
configured a set of different white

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:29,020
boxes with each of these we work with

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:32,950
two open networking ODMs a jima and edge

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:37,390
core and we stitched it all together

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:40,410
with a single common open network

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,850
operating system from snap route and

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:46,659
this common operating system works

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,999
across all the boxes and really provide

00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:52,690
a tremendous amount of capability to

00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:54,549
take this much much further we did a lot

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,669
of interesting things here that we've

00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:00,820
never done before we program some of the

00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:06,009
packet pipeline processing with the open

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:10,629
p4 language we did this running ran

00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:13,119
carrier features such as MPLS we managed

00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:18,599
the white box network with telemetry

00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:22,269
into own app and this amazing team of

00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:26,129
collaboration did all of this in less

00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:28,690
than three months in fact one of the

00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:33,539
merchants silicon providers provide us a

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:37,029
chip right out of the silicon foundry

00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:39,340
back in December and again in less than

00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:42,369
three months we had that chip running in

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:47,169
production with live traffic on it I've

00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:51,309
never seen in all my career us deliver

00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:53,830
something from chip to production that

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:56,409
quickly and so it's really excited about

00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:00,369
the potential of what these white boxes

00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:02,950
can deliver so think about it it wasn't

00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:06,639
just about a half a decade ago what it

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:10,269
took the process six terabits per second

00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:11,769
of packets you'd walk into one of our

00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:14,619
data centers or one of our central

00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,349
offices and you'd see basically half a

00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:21,879
dozen refrigerator-sized racks of

00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:26,200
routers now processing six terabits per

00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:28,840
second can be done on one chip that fits

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,950
on the palm of your hand installed into

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:36,970
a white box the size of a pizza box and

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:41,349
all controlled by an open common network

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:44,169
OS this is really fantastic and we think

00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:48,070
this is going to open up a whole new

00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:51,489
opportunity of things to come so why did

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:53,289
we do this this is more than just about

00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:56,190
lowering costing the achieving higher

00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:59,559
performance frankly that's table stakes

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:04,179
this is really about removing barriers

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:08,919
removing layers removing all that

00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:12,190
internal proprietary API stack that we

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:15,279
lived with with these legacy IT systems

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:18,070
now we can bypass all of that and go

00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,980
straight to own app this is about

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:24,159
pushing software program ability as far

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:29,259
down into the switch as possible the

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:31,570
furthest we've ever seen ever this is

00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:34,869
also about removing all that multi

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:37,600
vendor CLI removing all the complexity

00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:40,600
around what it takes to test all these

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,330
multi vendor routing configurations that

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,159
would take frankly months and months and

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,860
months for us to test

00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:52,090
now we've completely sped up the process

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:56,409
here again by this very open common

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:59,470
approach this was really removing the

00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,940
barriers of entry of innovation one

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:05,409
great example I want to highlight here

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:08,649
is the ease of use of utilizing P fours

00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:11,110
in band network telemetry and we were

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:14,909
able to use this on top of this barefoot

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:18,789
Tofino chip and it was really remarkable

00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:20,100
what we were able to see this gives us

00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:23,440
for the first time

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:26,860
unprecedented fine-grained visibility on

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,809
a per packet level if this were like a

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,269
medical conference I would be talking

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,820
about how we're moving from x-rays to

00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:38,710
MRIs that's how big a deal this is

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:41,789
okay think about being able to find the

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:45,220
state of every packet in your network

00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:49,210
this is no longer the world of you know

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,039
traceroute and relying on on SNMP meds

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,580
that you can only pull every five

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,610
minutes

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:57,369
in fact traceroute I just looked up was

00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:00,580
actually invented 30 years ago this year

00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:02,730
so pretty rudimentary still most

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,779
commonly used tools out there probably

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:11,230
this is about getting fine-grain

00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:13,120
telemetry visibility that allow us to do

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:17,559
some amazing things on the

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,890
old side think about this like what GPS

00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,450
did for the smartphone all of a sudden

00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,570
when GPS was enabled with the

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,559
smartphone's all these amazing new

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,230
things could happen

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,320
think about navigation think about how

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,680
you order your food or you order a car

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,450
to come pick you up this is the kind of

00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,400
capability in the new sort of

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,400
opportunities and industries that we

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,490
think this new visibility will bring to

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,059
networking and this is really important

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,700
to us from the standpoint of 5g 5g is

00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:55,240
more than just about delivering much

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,550
faster speeds it's also about delivering

00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,760
ultra-low latency highly reliable

00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,880
services you think of all the common use

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,770
cases you hear about self-driving cars

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,140
how are those going to work how is that

00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,990
car how is your car going to know about

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,600
that dangerous pothole to car lengths

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,850
ahead of you when another car just went

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,040
through it wouldn't you want to have a

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,530
highly reliable ultra-low latency

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,679
network that will ensure that that

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:26,380
packet of that information to get to

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,230
your car to move you into safety gets

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,780
through those are just one of many many

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:35,860
new use cases that are going to happen

00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:39,670
by getting this level of visibility so

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:43,360
with that in closing here I can't tell

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:46,890
you how excited I am to see all of you

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:50,410
be a part of this new evolution

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,890
networking is really going to change the

00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,370
world

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:57,010
it's more than just more than just

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,660
making Sdn better this is about

00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,960
connecting lives and creating new

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,370
opportunities and this is really about

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,160
helping make life easier and happier

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:10,170
around the world so with that I'm open

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,170
to take a couple questions thank you

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:26,400
any question I can't see so hello I am

00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:28,530
Rajesh this is from the Academy as we

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,350
know from the Pareto principle only 20%

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:35,010
can success so what things you expect

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:37,910
the academia pnes should look into for

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:42,660
the future from this perspective what

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:45,060
you have given well so that's a good

00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,610
question so everything is about the 8020

00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,500
rule right true and so everything should

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,100
be about you know what are the things

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,460
that are most important let me tell you

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,840
in a couple areas that we need help with

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,310
that I think the 20% should focus on

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,320
when it comes to new features and

00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:09,080
capabilities for the network such as

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:13,980
with Network virtual network functions

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:17,520
we really want to see functions that can

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,820
align on standards you know that old

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,100
saying you know we don't want to build

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,830
for snowflakes it's really about

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,260
building for Lego blocks we really want

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,230
to make sure that whatever you deliver

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,030
is standard and we'd like to see as much

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,160
of that as open but we realize too that

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,100
there's a proprietary aspect that people

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:42,080
need to make a business out of and so

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:45,030
how do you you know how do you do that I

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,070
ask you to look at this own app platform

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,890
and all the capability it has because it

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,480
really can allow you to do both it can

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,500
allow you to deliver things in a

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,270
standardized way very quickly but also

00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,150
has the ability where you can sell your

00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,820
secret sauce as well and so that's one

00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:05,880
big focus area I would say the 20%

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,460
should be focused on great thank you

00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,970
regarding those math standards it takes

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,910
almost a decade to actually become a

00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,700
standard so before that there probably

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:21,900
might be some things where we have to

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,670
trial upon so that that can be left yeah

00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,020
so I would just say and I can take

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,210
more question here because I've got this

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,160
hook here on the tank you but just

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,290
really quickly on that open source

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,030
really isn't about standards it's really

00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:36,240
about getting into a community working

00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:38,490
together to align the community and to

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,590
make sure this contribution gets adopted

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,230
so I would tell you from a standards

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,510
perspective we really want to focus more

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,120
on open source it's a much faster

00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:51,240
vehicle but certainly there needs to be

00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,450
standardized aspects about it but it's

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,270
really working in these much more faster

00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,160
agile open communities is the way to go

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,190
one last quick question and then I've

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,440
got a I rap merit from e times thanks

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,990
for your talk can you give us any sense

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,690
of under the covers which you expect to

00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,520
see in terms of your adoption of these

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,410
white box systems and new kind of

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,350
merchants silicon for a more

00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,790
programmable silicon in the future and

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,700
what you want to see in those systems

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:23,880
and chips yeah so as I mentioned it's

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,700
really about we're looking for solutions

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,710
that are open that we can do new and

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,250
interesting things as I discussed

00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,230
earlier and the opportunity here is huge

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,710
if you think about how the cloud is

00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,300
evolving how the cloud is pushing

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:43,110
frankly going to push back to the edge

00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,700
and you think about service providers

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,200
such as ourselves and the way we're

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,530
positioned we have here domestically

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:56,490
5,000 central offices we have over

00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:59,160
65,000 cell sites cell towers these are

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,350
all opportunities here for all these

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,020
routing and switching solutions and the

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:07,290
time is really right now as 5gs coming

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,360
onboard here this is the opportunity to

00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,180
get this right and to take advantage of

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,940
these new approaches so I think it's a

00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,270
it's a really exciting time and I would

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,830
tell you you know stay tuned there's a

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,960
lot more interesting things that we all

00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,850
have to share later in the year so with

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,990
that I'm going to pass the mic here

00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,050
thank you

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,050
