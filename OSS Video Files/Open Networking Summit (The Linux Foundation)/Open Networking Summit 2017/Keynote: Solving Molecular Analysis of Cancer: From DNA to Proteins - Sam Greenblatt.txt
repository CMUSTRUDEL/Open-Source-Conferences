	Keynote: Solving Molecular Analysis of Cancer: From DNA to Proteins - Sam Greenblatt, CTO, Nano Global

This session will focus on the networking requirements using open source to treat diseases through cell-based analysis at the molecular level. Transporting this knowledge across devices and centers requires a whole new structure and networking. Terabits per second with high-availability and guaranteed delivery is required to meet the needs. Shared knowledge is the critical  for real-time analysis. This will discuss data flows, open networking, and databases that are all open source and have been optimized for this problem.
