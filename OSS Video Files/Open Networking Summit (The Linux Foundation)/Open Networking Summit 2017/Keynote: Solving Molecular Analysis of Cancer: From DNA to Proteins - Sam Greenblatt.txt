Description: 
	Keynote: Solving Molecular Analysis of Cancer: From DNA to Proteins - Sam Greenblatt, CTO, Nano Global

This session will focus on the networking requirements using open source to treat diseases through cell-based analysis at the molecular level. Transporting this knowledge across devices and centers requires a whole new structure and networking. Terabits per second with high-availability and guaranteed delivery is required to meet the needs. Shared knowledge is the critical  for real-time analysis. This will discuss data flows, open networking, and databases that are all open source and have been optimized for this problem.

thank you what it did what a way to end

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,500
your day talking about cancer as it

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:14,940
doesn't quite do well at cocktail

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,460
parties let me start out by telling you

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,000
how I got interested and then I'm going

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,570
to go into what it's all about when I

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,800
was at Dell there was a project that the

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:33,480
Arizona State University and it was

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:40,530
called Tegan & P gen was basically doing

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:44,719
molecular analysis of genomics in order

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:49,469
to be able to cure or at least identify

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:53,489
some of the problems with pediatric

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:58,530
cancer there's nothing that is more

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:03,500
important to open networking than to be

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:09,000
able to enable this kind of application

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:12,119
everybody in this room has cancer the

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,390
reason you're not dying of it is because

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,860
your killer cell which is in your immune

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:23,700
system is basically killing the cancer

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:28,259
but somewhere along the line the killer

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,259
cell either goes to sleep or basically

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,549
cannot see the cancer clips cancers

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:39,320
cloaking it what happens is we are going

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,740
to be talking about precision medicine

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,509
when we look back at this year in

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:51,600
medicine we're going to look at the way

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:53,970
we practice oncology as the way almost

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,520
like bloodletting and I'm not saying

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:03,630
that negatively we do not understand up

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,560
until just recently how to work on

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,560
solving the problem in our lifetime

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,840
that's going to help us we want to

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,879
improve patient outcomes

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,300
have to read it for you but what's

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,099
important is what i'm going to show you

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:26,370
the next couple slides how it works and

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:31,650
it requires a network in order to

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:36,410
basically create enough data to give the

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:40,140
oncologist of you and let the cancer

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:43,980
tumors speak to us and tell us what it

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,819
needs and eventually we'll be able to

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,480
deal with the information but the

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:55,739
problem is no one I know linkedin was

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:59,760
just here realizes that genomic data is

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:03,989
the second biggest big data issue that

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,799
we all have number one is YouTube's the

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:11,610
largest genomics is number two but what

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:16,440
we need to do is take this thing up here

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:21,630
and you can see it that's the genome you

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:25,260
can look at it you can see the helix you

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:29,639
see the ACG tease the way that it's

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:33,480
created that's really a blueprint that

00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:37,310
generates proteins and from that helix

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:42,900
and the 23 chromosomes thus the name

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:48,019
23andme you're able to determine what a

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:53,040
person is like everybody in this room

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:56,910
male and female we have ninety-nine

00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:02,840
point nine percent of our genomic data

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:06,829
is identical it's that point 0 1 percent

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,230
that makes the difference of who we are

00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:15,660
whether you're tall with your female

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:20,180
whether you're basically going to be fat

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:23,360
like I am or short or tall but it also

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,410
what we need to do is take a look at it

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,440
because if you look at

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:35,010
it's 3.3 billion pairs of nucleotide

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:39,210
pairs if you I'm going to show you how

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:42,150
much and its coding five thousand five

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:46,770
hundred thousand proteins what this does

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:49,410
is this generates a lot of data and from

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,590
any one of these proteins you can

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,310
rebuild the human being that came out of

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:59,490
that DNA and the way gets down there is

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,160
something called RNA or new g lighted

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:06,960
assets and I'm not going to give you a

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:11,900
cancer lesson but what's important is we

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:15,150
need to give the oncologist through or

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,710
technology the best evidence-based

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:24,630
information available and what we found

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:29,100
is farmer genetics companies need to

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:33,300
accelerate the drugs not health a one of

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,960
my heroes dr. Patrick soon-shiong has

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,460
just gotten into phase one with a cancer

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,610
vaccine we never thought we'd see that

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:47,490
what that is done he's able to build

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,250
that because he can look at the unique

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,720
biology and the specific health

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:58,710
conditions of a patient and it enables

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:04,080
the patients to also participate in the

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:07,740
curing of their disease we have to speed

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,080
up the analysis and that means we have

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:14,280
to take all this data and moving through

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,380
the network extremely fast and one of

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,760
the things that you just often linked in

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:25,050
which is being used is kafka kafka and

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:28,470
what that is is basically a producer

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,750
broker consumer model where you can

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,640
create virtual speeds that we never

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,310
thought would be in the network and

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,590
you've got to be able to do the data

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:41,830
flows right and I'll talk about that is

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:46,300
second so one of the things that is used

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:48,850
is 95 and people will get knife is a

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,850
while you the dupes running around

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:56,830
talking about it but what it does is it

00:06:51,850 --> 00:07:00,370
enables you to do data flows anybody who

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:03,280
thinks of the network is a plane and not

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:07,240
doing data flows has to start rethinking

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,920
some of these applications cassandra is

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,910
in the mix for key databases spark

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,790
Apaches there so you can do in memory

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:22,420
manipulation of the data and one of the

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:25,930
things we want to do is once we get down

00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,900
to that point on one percent which we

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:33,010
will call the variant we want to analyze

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,800
it up against something of a healthy

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:39,670
gene which is called a germ line and

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:45,280
when you see the differences you start

00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:48,030
to see where the discrepancy is so what

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,670
happens is you have sequencer machines

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:55,330
as you know we've gone from ten thousand

00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:59,410
dollars to sequence back ten years ago a

00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:03,010
DNA sequence to under a hundred dollars

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:06,490
you have aluminum all the way down to

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:10,810
Oxford nanopore that just came out but

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:13,870
take a look at the sample size for a 50x

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,700
and what that means is you take the DNA

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:21,550
sequence and you basically cut it into

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,220
50 slices and the reason you're doing

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,380
that is so that you can start the

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,860
variant analysis and I'm not going to go

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,770
through how that happens but it's a

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,250
hundred and fifty gigs of data per

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:41,380
person sitting in this room the bam file

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:44,530
is another output and it's a hundred and

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:47,380
fifty gigabytes and then you have a

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:50,410
ninety cram which takes you down the

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,570
ninety four gigabytes and it has

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,810
something called lousy compare

00:08:52,570 --> 00:09:00,100
and while it's lousy compression is

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:03,700
there can be many earths so what we do

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:08,580
is we don't want to use crammed files we

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:11,530
rather get it down to a more usable math

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,680
mechanism that we can move across the

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:19,870
network and we want to do it in a pull

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:23,170
model not a push model we want to then

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,780
take it into a mapping alignment so once

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:30,960
you get these 50 pieces the first thing

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:34,810
you do is called a hidden Markovian

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:38,350
matrix and put it all back together and

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:44,410
when you do what you want to look at is

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:48,580
the variance from the in the DNA that is

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:52,840
not identical and then if you look at it

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:56,470
this says 3.3 billion of which only

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,410
three million are variants so the thing

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,020
you're fishing for is the variant but

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,470
once you find the variant you also want

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:09,850
to look at sequencing the RNA which is

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:13,420
the assets that move down to the

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:17,890
proteins and you want to basically look

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:22,030
for what is going on and you also want

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:26,490
to use images of the tumor and you want

00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,490
to take biometric data such as

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:34,110
electronic medical records and all this

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:39,700
stuff has to move at the speed of the

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:43,660
real time we don't have time to wait the

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,160
sequencing used to take three days we're

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,550
lucky if we can get it down to three

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,670
hours some of the new processes get it

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:54,990
down under an hour and then once you get

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:59,410
it you got to get it in line with the

00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:02,500
radiology with the imaging with the drum

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,320
lines and put this all together and it's

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,250
moving over a big network this is not

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,160
just an H

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:13,150
pc problem this is an open networking

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:16,810
problem and the one thing about open

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:20,050
source and you heard orbit say came from

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:25,000
the days of os feel when Linux first

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:28,150
came out the open source community can

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,440
work hand-in-hand to making this a

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:36,640
reality so what you need is you need a

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:40,920
data pipeline you heard of and you see

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:45,630
Kafka and knife on you want to basically

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:49,120
transmit this sections to a server and

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,580
then what you need to do is you need to

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,730
get and why we went to knife I it's

00:11:51,580 --> 00:12:00,520
lossless you can't get lousy day lousy

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,980
reception and I hate the fact they call

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,620
it lossy because it sounds like lousy

00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,890
and then you want to deal with data

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,080
program Provence because you're moving

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:16,120
all kinds of different types of data as

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:19,600
fast as you can the key is parallel ism

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:23,339
we always knew it but we didn't know

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:29,140
what applications would have to drive it

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:31,860
so one of the companies is using an FPGA

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,950
at a goat genome and down in San Diego

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:39,700
has a chip called the dragon and it

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:42,970
takes the four hours down to under an

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,910
hour and then one of the things you got

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,000
to do is you can't afford hours so you

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:52,810
got to use smith-waterman to basically

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,450
do cute quality control and at the same

00:12:52,810 --> 00:13:01,720
time you want to look at the IBM just

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:05,100
announced the first commercial quantum

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:09,100
computer qubits are beautiful things

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,860
because the parallelism and the quantum

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,890
entanglement really takes away the

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,890
fabric would you just saw and by doing

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,540
that and being able to create all this

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,570
parallelism

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:26,529
all the sudden you're speeding up to no

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:31,829
end when Ginni Rometty the CEO of IBM

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:35,199
announced the IBM Q which is our quantum

00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:39,970
computing one of the things they talked

00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:43,360
about which is using it for genomics we

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:46,240
actually believe it's great needs the

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,720
networking needs needs to be distributed

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,759
and one of the things that we're

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:57,880
starting to look at we haven't is

00:13:51,759 --> 00:14:00,190
blockchain fabricating so that you get

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,639
more security knife i gives you great

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,639
security with encryption but you need

00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:10,449
speed and that's where you guys come in

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:13,380
the open networking committees have to

00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:17,380
look at it not just as moving around

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,959
general Ledger's or any other accounting

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,810
data you've got to look at your moving

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:28,329
valuable data that saves people's lives

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:30,399
I can go through the molecular profiling

00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:35,699
I'm sure this is going to be available

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:39,970
to you DNA is 3 billion base pairs

00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:43,540
20,000 genes is by the way 14 million

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:49,029
people in the United States today have

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:52,870
cancer and the act and we get 7 million

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:55,600
every month so you gotta ask is a

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,980
growing that exponentially no we're

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,889
losing people so we got to win this war

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,360
the recent publication is the genome

00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:09,790
atlas and I'm not going to go through

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:14,199
that so here's the problem 20,000 genes

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:17,380
and three billion DNA base pairs until

00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:21,910
recently the scientists have focused

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:24,490
only on two percent and incorporating

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:28,870
something called a priori assumption

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:32,620
that captures the most common jeans we

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:37,190
have to get everyone in the country

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:41,029
sequenced right now we have about thirty

00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:44,630
two million people sequenced countries

00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:46,550
of over 350 so you can imagine what kind

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,440
of data we're going to get and what kind

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:54,529
of network needs we're going to have so

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:59,089
it's really also increasing because we

00:15:54,529 --> 00:16:03,050
got to take the radiology the imaging

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:05,779
and the electronical medical records put

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,760
them all together we got to create

00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:12,079
something called logic total record

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:15,260
access across multiple cases and we have

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:18,860
to know the outcomes so when you get a

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:23,029
variant you can see whether or not it

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:26,029
affects people and a classic example is

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:30,529
the guy who invented the concept of

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:34,670
sequencing was a young guy and when he

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:38,420
did it he found that when he did his own

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:41,149
sequence he had a variant that really

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,990
matched a lot of people who had prostate

00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:47,420
cancer so he went to his doctor and he

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:51,019
said I want to be checked for prostate

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,709
cancer and the guy says we don't do PSA

00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:58,069
test unless you're over 35 or 40 years

00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:01,459
old this is the old medicine go to the

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:05,600
prescription go to the concept and

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:07,880
believe in annika logic doctors get very

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,750
uptight when you want to use a new

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,770
protocol so all of a sudden by looking

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:23,949
at this he got his PSA backing guess

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:27,049
what he had a very aggressive cancer and

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:30,470
he had to get operated on but it was

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:33,169
caught very early that is the beauty in

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:36,590
the magic this is not magic this is a

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:38,990
lot of computations a lot of cognitive

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:42,470
and machine learning a lot of different

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:45,110
sources bringing it together there's a

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,010
couple software company say we can build

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,400
our database

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:53,030
databases are worthless unless they're

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:57,140
proactive so what are the technology

00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:00,410
issues transport messaging and data

00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:05,660
graphing and real-time transport and

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:07,910
security as of today and you never know

00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:12,530
in this country HIPAA is still in effect

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:16,640
and we basically want to make sure the

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,700
patient confidentiality is there the svn

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,510
is required for aggregating the

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:26,390
bandwidth and also dynamically routing

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:29,030
and bringing up more bandwidth when it's

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:33,050
needed through multiple ports and

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:37,790
dynamic adjustments cognitive systems

00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:41,510
are in at inadequate today for analysis

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:45,650
I know IBM is going around saying Watson

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:49,780
can do it and Cassandra's the fastest

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,780
mechanism we found for data storage

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,880
problems with the existing data we've

00:18:52,850 --> 00:19:00,230
been collecting data for years four

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:05,090
percent six percent of the data did not

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:09,220
provide the proper or DNA RNA to be

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:13,940
accurate without a germ line which is a

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:17,410
cancer-free concept we have sixty-nine

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,060
percent false positives because the data

00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,300
we're getting smarter and smarter and

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,780
letting the tumor speak to us we had

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,910
twenty-six percent false negatives if I

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,100
took this to any one of my old bosses

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,430
and said I'm going to be wrong

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,680
sixty-nine percent of the time and

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:38,060
twenty-six percent of the times i want

00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,810
to tell you it's not there it's there

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:45,380
i'd be shot so we got to create a bridge

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:48,160
and that's where you guys come in we got

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:52,370
it basically take the open-source

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:56,710
technology to be able to deal with the

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,429
traffic demands of this amount of data i

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,460
looked at

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:06,289
if the block chaining is fascinating if

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:13,240
we can get it performing properly open

00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:15,799
SDN is absolutely important what's

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:20,059
happening is we're getting closer and

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:24,049
closer to developing a cancer vaccine it

00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:27,049
is in phase one trial at FDA right now

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:30,409
and it needs FDA approval to go through

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:34,399
all four phases but unless we get the

00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:38,210
technology to move the data and dr.

00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:43,009
Sheerin says I got it that's great but

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:45,950
you have 26 cancer centers in the United

00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:50,899
States all getting samples or getting

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:54,249
real-time data we need this group to

00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:59,360
really think about open sourcing things

00:20:54,249 --> 00:21:02,480
not just for the businesses and trying

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,850
to make networks better but actually

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,429
solving a major problem in this world

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:13,909
cancer 2020 if you don't know what that

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:17,480
is that is the national immunotherapy a

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:20,629
coalition started by Joe Biden because

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,499
the Sun beau died of cancer and we're

00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:27,850
seeking to accelerate the potential of

00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:31,249
convocation combination immunotherapy

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:34,879
where most of this data comes from so

00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:37,429
what my whole message to you is when you

00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:39,590
come this conference and whether you

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:42,350
want to talk about open daylight and if

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:46,129
they would it whatever it is you want to

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:48,019
talk about the whole stack you really

00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:50,389
should talk about the whole stack

00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,639
because these are the kind of

00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:57,350
applications that are going to change

00:21:52,639 --> 00:22:00,740
the world my old friend Steve Jobs has

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:04,970
saying those people who think they can

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:08,090
change the world really do dr. Shin is

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:11,240
doing that in cancer and I think this

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,020
group working together not just the

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,830
carriers

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:18,350
but everybody else can change the world

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:21,530
so I could have gone very deep I could

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:26,150
explain the problems with payers and

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:28,640
pharmacies and doctors and patients but

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:32,860
I rather just show you what the what the

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,540
problem world facing is and with that I

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:40,490
want to thank you for your time unless

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:44,150
you have a question I if you want to

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:47,300
talk about immunity and meaner therapy

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,970
will be glad to talk about that but I

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,990
will take one or two questions well

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,180
thank you very much for this kind of

00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,560
inspiring presentation I think curing

00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,300
cancer is something that's really

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,920
exciting and you know perhaps motivates

00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,240
people more than maybe like oh I don't

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,290
help the phone company save money

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,910
although if you're the phone coming

00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,710
saving money is great right and cheaper

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,600
phone calls and more services good too

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,950
but I have a couple questions for you

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,840
couple things that I find it very

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,110
interesting and kind of you know

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,910
genomics you know one of them is that

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,040
often you know there are at least two

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,840
flavors of humans you know xx and XY

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,700
humans in it their differences a

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,260
cellular level and actually like male

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,060
humans are closer to it may be closer

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,310
genetically to chimps then to female

00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:29,330
humans and do you think like and that's

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:31,580
sort of course number 12 is is this idea

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,110
of privacy of data as you know whenever

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,490
you send something out over the network

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,080
well the cats out of the bag you no

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,660
longer control it and so do you think

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,220
that you know in the networking like you

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,230
know open networking and open source can

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,210
help you know improve the situation in

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,580
both of these areas first is like you

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,110
know considering you know all the

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,480
different types that you know both types

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,800
and other types of human cells and

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,240
possibly their differences which we

00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,220
don't normally necessarily do enough of

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,500
and the other is dealing with this data

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,770
privacy data privacy is important the

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,950
reason you see knife I splattered all

00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:07,370
over data flows is you know that came

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:10,310
from the NSA they donated it what could

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:13,340
possibly go wrong to the Apache we can't

00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,930
we can't unmask who donated it but we

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:18,310
can tell you that it was donated by the

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:23,600
NSA that's a jerk by the way I'm not

00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:26,809
before I end up on TV the one thing

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,690
that we do know is networking and

00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:33,020
privacy is going to be a big hot topic

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:39,860
especially in this as far as looking at

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:43,070
chromosomes proteins rnase and DNA and

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,020
looking at the differences your germ

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,419
line if you're a female is totally

00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,610
different than if your germ line of a

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:52,390
male but believe it or not you still

00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:55,789
have ninety-nine point nine percent

00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:59,020
similarities in the way your genome is

00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:02,000
formed and by the way the genome is

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:05,600
literally determined at point of

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,250
conception not a time of birth what

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,760
you're going to be and what you're going

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:14,929
to grow to be was determined when you

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,240
were when the egg was fertilized so I

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:18,799
don't know how open source can help with

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:28,750
that but I know they can help with

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:28,750
