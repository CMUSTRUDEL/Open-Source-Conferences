00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:04,770
target's driving growth through all the

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,460
great investments were making to

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,530
reimagine our store experience as we

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,340
continue to open flex format stores will

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,470
focus on three areas college campuses

00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,810
dense suburban areas and urban

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,880
neighborhoods we then curate our

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,920
assortment and our store design - what's

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:31,619
right for the local neighborhood and our

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:33,719
guests love the experience my name is

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,489
Gillian I work here in the Rittenhouse

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,190
area at a nearby restaurant a couple

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,100
blocks away I find myself here a couple

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,800
times a week it kind of turned into my

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,539
convenience store the fresh fruit and

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,340
produce is all here right when you walk

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,050
in there's apparel right at your

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,329
fingertips and then you only have to

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,969
walk a couple steps away to find

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,890
everything else that you need it makes

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,630
me feel at home which is really really

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,759
awesome

00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,759
[Music]

00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,409
my name is community are Piett I live in

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,350
Long Beach California and I'm a working

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,869
mother of two I like shopping at this

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,150
target because it's very convenient it's

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,970
right next to where I work and it gets

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,070
me in and out quickly I come to the

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,320
store at least three times a week they

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,600
have the essentials so things that you

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,530
run out of quickly you can just come in

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,990
here and pick them up

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,270
I also can go online and make a shopping

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,159
list order it up and just pick it up I'd

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,750
like to spend my time more cooking meals

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,220
and spending time with my family so I

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,229
can just run in here pick up a few

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,509
things and be on my way to cooking that

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,189
meal and spending time at home you know

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,049
I work with students at the college and

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,390
I get asked well you know I'm not from

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,799
here where can I go and I just tell them

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,799
right up the street there's a target

00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:55,969
my name is Brittany I'm a third-year at

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,530
UC Berkeley and we're at my neighborhood

00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:00,080
Target store

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,830
what's most Berkeley about the store is

00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,180
probably the size and its location

00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,310
definitely into accordance to campus

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,800
it's pretty conveniently located with

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,780
class schedules being so crazy and like

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,460
random sometimes I'll only have an hour

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,700
so it's really easy to just come in and

00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,020
go out back to class I love most targets

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,940
just because there's always that cheery

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,560
bright red but I definitely love the

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,890
artwork on here I think it's really like

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,110
custom and different I grew up with my

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,150
mom going shopping at Target and now

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,739
with this location downtown in Berkeley

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:38,030
I feel like targets definitely growing

00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:40,850
with me hello everyone this is Lakshmi

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,950
Sharma I'm vice president cloud and

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,709
compute and platform engineering at

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,260
Target I'm going to take you through the

00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,510
IT transformation journey that target

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,970
that's happening a target to deliver the

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,350
best guest experience and how it is

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,480
happening it's happening through

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,239
continuous learning process using

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,989
technology all-around through putting

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,630
agile devops using open sources all of

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:09,200
it using networking data all of it in

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:11,090
scale and in action at scale and how we

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,620
are doing it I'll take you through some

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,900
of the glimpses glimpses of that

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:20,180
technology transformation and the

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:22,070
business drivers behind it so some of

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,140
the pieces I will cover so there what's

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,060
the investment we that's behind what are

00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,560
the business driver what's happening in

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,150
infrastructure and operation space

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,120
what's happening in connectivity

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,390
connectivity is about networking data

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,880
center networking cloud networking and

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,950
what is a how is this whole thing you're

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,560
in connected the video that you saw I

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,709
will keep referring to that video in how

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,620
technology is driving that evolution

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,570
that you saw here and how data is data

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,480
is being used how analytics has been

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,700
used to drive the entire experience I'm

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,190
going to take you through and how could

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,019
you help so what are the you know direct

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,360
feedback from some of the consumers of

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,310
this technology which is our users in

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,290
the stores and the team members of the

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,970
stores I have taken some of the feedback

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,780
and I brought it brought it here to

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,780
share with all of you

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:20,510
so some little bit about us target is it

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,340
it 1806 1806 in United States

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,590
thirty-year distribution centers

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,600
continue to grow three hundred and

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,540
twenty three thousand team members all

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,400
across these tours and headquarter we

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,040
are headquartered in Minneapolis and we

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,100
have a global team in India we are the

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,460
fourth most visited retail website in

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,580
United States and more than 26 million

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,060
unique visitors and unique mediums and

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,650
unique visitors each month on average so

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,080
when you are given I'm giving these

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,060
numbers think think of it as IP

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,120
addresses think of it as the data

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,760
endpoints IOT n and multiply them by

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,890
some number X numbers to get to your IOT

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,480
devices so that's the scale of the data

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,910
and that's the scale of the network

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,830
bandwidth and latency I'm talking about

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:12,740
and that's where technology

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:15,920
transformation is important so seven

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,930
billion dollar in February our CEO Brian

00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,420
Cornell he announced an investment

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,160
capital investment of this much amount

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,190
over the next three years in various

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,120
categories to drive to drive the sales

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:32,540
to increase the market share and to

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,240
increase the guest experience at all

00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,000
levels levels at digital level said

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,700
mobile phone stores all around all

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,770
across the sector's so all of that and

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,080
what the thing that is driving it the

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,750
most is technology and our supply chains

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,280
so innovation in those two areas

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,440
innovation and digital that's all is

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:57,470
driving and that's where the investment

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:59,600
is happening and what are the what are

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,210
the pillar is that that are going to be

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,730
used in order to kind of feel this

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,130
growth and get get us to the market show

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:10,010
that we are looking at a digital first

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,710
and three pillars will be looking at

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,900
stores digital channel and supply chain

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,910
how do we bring them how do we bring

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,430
them together and make them a smart

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,770
network a smart network from a supply

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,569
chain perspective and smart network from

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,999
connectivity perspective

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:28,610
and what else do you put on top of it to

00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:30,889
drive the efficiencies across all of

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,800
them to get to our vision and get to our

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,110
goal of us high scale high efficiency

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:43,639
and the best user experience best guest

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:46,159
experience we have five priorities that

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,189
we have identified and not all of them

00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:51,080
may sound to you directly as some

00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:52,999
technical priorities but think of all of

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,649
them somehow connected through some

00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:56,419
technology somehow being delivered

00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:59,509
through software or some hardware

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,639
experience on-demand shopping it's not

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,009
just online on-demand shopping miss any

00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,529
Enosh Anytime Anywhere

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,360
same shopping experience if you have a

00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:10,759
cellphone and you're going to an online

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,099
if you're an app on your cell phone or

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,169
you're using a laptop or you are in

00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,479
store using a laptop you're in store

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:20,029
using a phone no matter where you are

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:23,389
giving you the same experience same

00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,699
quality you being able to ship an item

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:28,189
which is ordered from online to your

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,589
home within a time that you want you can

00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:32,599
go to a store and be standing in a line

00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:34,519
somebody coming to you and getting your

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,990
order delivered right when you're when

00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,419
you're thinking that you spend more than

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,069
15 minutes in the line think of all

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,759
those possibilities and all of them

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:46,699
means on-demand shopping experience

00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,680
merchandise categories on the item side

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,300
yes we need to continue to evolve one

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,369
what are the categories and what are

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,369
different brands that we will continue

00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:57,860
to kind of add to our portfolio look

00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:59,419
localization and personalization now

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,599
we'll refer back to the video that you

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:04,999
saw and combining the next bullet which

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,409
is small format so a lot of investment

00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,599
that we have announced that's going to

00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:11,990
happen in next few years is in a small

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,629
format stores or in remodel ization of a

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,939
store so what does that mean so when we

00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:20,419
are going from a big general purpose

00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:23,149
tour format to a small format which if a

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,089
lot of customization need to happen in

00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,199
the inventory a lot of space

00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:30,589
consolidation need to happen you cannot

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:34,130
buy the same size store as you buy in

00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:36,390
you know in some remote area the similar

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,160
similar amount of money and a similar

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,140
count of inventory you won't be

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,810
operationally efficient if you use the

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,750
same kind of capacity in say San

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,270
Francisco City or in New York so in

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,550
order to address the local needs of the

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,190
market in order to address the give the

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:56,580
personal experience to your guests in

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,220
the store the small format stores are

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,930
going to be key but what it means is

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,640
that there is a huge amount of

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,070
innovation that needs to happen in

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,250
supply chain now you cannot use those

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:11,340
big trucks sending big boxes of items

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,740
now you're thinking about really your

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,570
personalized experience of five items of

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,810
each type or one item of each type

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,690
coming to a store now visualize each

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,400
item has an RFID tag in each item needs

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,440
to be placed somewhere to be brought

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,170
from hundreds of location to that store

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,020
the small form is told they may not have

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,000
any inventory in the store so how a

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,660
distribution center is going to send

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,610
them in the time so that that that small

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,050
format store which is sitting in a

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,410
university which is sitting at the

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:46,380
corner of a very very populated or

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,540
densely populated diverse kind of area

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,640
so all of that is technology you are

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,800
talking about how you pull the inventory

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,110
same day within an hour from a

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,340
fulfillment center how do you deliver

00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,500
that to the guests

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,630
you know ship to that ship to a guest

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,180
all of that in this new format word

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,800
supply chain software and technology

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,450
they all get march together while we are

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,690
focusing on the priorities it's really

00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,800
important that we continue to look at

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,470
transformation in a way that we continue

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,690
to simplify our cost we call it n minus

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,150
1 N and n plus 1 so every time we are

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,010
looking at n or n plus 1 we will

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,170
continue to kind of look at how do we

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,420
retire or how do we consolidate n minus

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,400
1 technology how do we consolidated

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,070
business processes which are n minus 1

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,600
before we get to n plus 1 otherwise the

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,790
number and the variations of the

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,730
processes and technologies that we use

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:44,430
will be will be out of control so

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,000
connecting with our guest so target one

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,089
and a half year ago like in July 2015

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,600
target open this

00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:55,120
a target open house it's a it's a place

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,449
of connected device concept so it's a

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,759
place where we can invite our guests we

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,860
can invite our partners and you know

00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,319
some customers and vendors they can

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,290
touch and feel what an IOT experience

00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:09,910
looks like how should we how should we

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,399
put things on the Shelf how do we use

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,290
technology to address the needs of this

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,259
flexible fulfillment we are talking

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,149
about the speed and delivery to our

00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,769
guests across different channels we are

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,259
talking about so there have been like

00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:25,420
around more than 75 companies in past 18

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:27,309
months more than hundred and fifty

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,529
thousand guests and customers and

00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:32,259
partners and even some friends from the

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:34,389
retail world like you know our partners

00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:36,220
from that industry have also come and

00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:38,499
they get to kind of experience and feel

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,290
how technology is put into action a

00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:43,990
really good place to see that how IOT

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,730
works and once we once we get that input

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,800
from our guests when we get that

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,870
experience from our partners in

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,089
technology and business we take that

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,550
experience then we try to put the best

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:57,279
case in to use and operate try to

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,980
operationalize that into our stores and

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,809
other experiences so a good concept so

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:07,059
so far we have learned a lot from this

00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:08,800
and will continue to do so all the

00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,429
transformation like at any time you're

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,709
talking about

00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:14,709
world called transformation you know

00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:16,329
it's people are the key right so culture

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:17,679
needs to be able to support that people

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:20,079
need to be able to support that

00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,209
technology transformation needs lot of

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,189
education a lot of learning a lot of

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:27,009
investment in people and target has done

00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:29,319
all of that a continuous learning does

00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,600
not happen if you don't give allow your

00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:33,670
team members allow your team's to invest

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,899
into that learning invest into that

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,990
training so we have we have gone gone

00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:43,079
and invested into people practices

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,970
around agile practices around DevOps

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,730
formal training in formal training and

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,620
putting special programs in place so

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,769
that we make it and put it into action

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,259
in real time so their investment in

00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:58,480
people investment in technology so when

00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:01,059
I talk about technology again going back

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,110
to supply chain putting that format

00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,750
putting a store like

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,339
they open store concept all of that is

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,220
about training and continuous learning

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,589
so me being there only five months as of

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,690
you know this month but a huge

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:16,120
investment has already happened here and

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,370
that's the reason to be honest I feel

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,709
like we are ready we are just ready to

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,839
take that investment that our CEO has

00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:25,600
announced and put it into action to the

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:30,910
right use and to really be a leader in

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,589
this space so if this investment has

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,190
already been happening if the culture is

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:39,220
ready what's changing its the speed so

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,930
if you want to do open these many stores

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,970
just change the way you are putting your

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,610
format and putting your supply chain

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,769
being almost real-time inventory

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,410
management on your shelf from the

00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:53,019
distribution center or shipping it takes

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,899
lot of speed and a kind of focus on that

00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:59,079
speed and delivery linear to smart

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:01,180
network what is linear means were just

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:04,510
very quick kind of definition from

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,760
retail like going from a merchandise or

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,250
a shipping comes from someplace x place

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,769
to a shipping place it goes to some

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,050
distribution center or some fulfillment

00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,970
center if it is digital then from there

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,310
this distribution center it will go to a

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,880
store and from store it gets fulfilled

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,769
or it gets sent to a and sent to a guest

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,050
if they have ordered it to shipped from

00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,570
store otherwise it gets just directly

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,190
sent to the guest from a fulfillment

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,220
center so think about all of that

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:36,399
so now what's changing from linear model

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,290
to a smart network means that it can

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,839
directly go from maybe a shipping place

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,240
directly to a customer or maybe a store

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,040
becomes a fulfillment center think of

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,839
how much technology changes now when

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,050
you're those of you like if you're

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,610
thinking network think of like what kind

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,769
of bandwidth would be required for those

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,720
stores what kind of backup things were

00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,420
you thinking about how do you serve a

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,279
small store versus a big store you know

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,589
satellite links all those kinds of

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,360
concept backup lengths but what would be

00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:06,850
that like what would be the latency for

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,860
that be like so that's all is going to

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,709
happen like with this change so linear

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,140
to smart network it's not just a process

00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:16,510
change it's a technology change as well

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,400
our digital infrastructure we re

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,040
platforming we have replayed from our

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,350
digital side and we re platforming it

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,510
more and more to support the scale to

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,970
support the new number of customers and

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,440
give the agility to our developers so

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,680
that they can continue to give these

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,510
applications every day we we have scrum

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,480
teams that have one day we have scrubs

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:40,240
that go one day we just put things from

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,580
writing to deploy within sometimes in

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,890
five minutes so that's how truly DevOps

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,840
we are and in order to support that

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,240
skill you really need that technology

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:53,050
and those people culture and mindset and

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,790
support the re-platforming mobile

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,040
channels so when you visit a Target

00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,470
store you see team members with devices

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,960
in hand so they can come to you and they

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,440
can offer you the same online experience

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,780
as you get from your mobile phone or

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,460
from your laptop so that that needs some

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,230
platform as well because you are

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,110
thinking about that being able to be

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:18,450
being able to from data center deploy

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:21,550
applications to all those 323,000

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,260
team members I talked about imagine the

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:26,980
scale platform running on those many

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,700
devices maybe into 2 into 3 X devices

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,230
and then that platform should be able to

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,110
deploy those applications that I talked

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,270
about which are being deployed every day

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,970
so that's the technology transformation

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,610
I'm talking about more speed more

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,590
performance stability capacity so how

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,510
much capacity would you need on an

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:50,230
Android device versus how much capacity

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:52,180
would you need an iPad versus you know

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,030
data center the server where you are

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,190
actually running these these application

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,050
where you're building these applications

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:02,080
so a lot of those you know decisions to

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:04,990
be made and but at all the time scale is

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,699
in our mind because that's a skill the

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,130
number of team members the number of

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:12,010
stores and how fast you kind of move

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:15,339
around your items across them how fast

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:18,250
you deploy a promotion or a coupon to a

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:20,650
guest who is coming online that's all

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,320
it's a huge scale we are looking at and

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,390
all of that would not happen if you

00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,850
don't have a feedback mechanism if an

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,950
item gets if you see a shelf which is

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,240
and of empty you'll feel like oh my god

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,730
is this tour going to close or something

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,309
right so even to from like how do you

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,860
fast kind of put things on the shelf and

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:40,870
if you're bringing experience online

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,809
experience to a customer how that

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,549
customer only gets gets the items and

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,830
things something which we are all used

00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,500
to doing it but at the back daily there

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,450
is some you know personalization there

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,000
is some Identity Management there is

00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,039
some analytics playing the role in order

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,080
to get you the inventory or in order to

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,390
get you the items on your screen that

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,390
that you want based on based on your

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,010
previous behavior so behavior analyst

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,470
analysis and the data analytics Identity

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,230
Management they all play a role in order

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:15,970
to get you the flexible and a experience

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:19,450
that you want for yourself so while we

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:22,090
are executing fast you know we cannot

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,970
lose the focus focus is on operational

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,570
efficiency we make sure that

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,070
operationally we are right

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,240
you cannot just deploy an application

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:33,610
which doesn't work because disrupting a

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,830
sales store we call them pause point of

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,169
sales or the cash registers that you see

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,659
you know imagining an application going

00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:43,030
bad at the deploy and you kind of

00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:45,309
holding all those files just cannot

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,990
happen there is no scope for making it

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:49,120
happen I mean this there's just no scope

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:51,340
for failure in those cases you kind of

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,559
somehow putting an application or an

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,090
upgrade on digital in imagining digital

00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,010
side going down and think of those

00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,260
twenty six million plus subscribers just

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,880
cannot happen so there is no scope for

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,789
error when it comes to configuration

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,669
management kind of deploy it has to be

00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:08,470
real time and it has to be right core

00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,710
business investment our core business

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,450
and digital code and supply chain and a

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,909
user experience that you get from it

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,860
that's core business investment store

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,720
shopping experience I talked about there

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,000
there was an application that just

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,960
really it was launched to two weeks ago

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,169
by our CIO CEO so it was it's about save

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,510
the sale so you you go online and then

00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,850
you save all the items there you go to a

00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,679
store you're standing in the line and

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,350
then somebody can come with come to you

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,580
and they will open your inventory from

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,530
online and they will

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,410
just look at this and we'll be able to

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,510
serve you so like as if you have bought

00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,690
that into the store so you can just

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,760
choose your items from any place

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,680
anywhere online and then you go to any

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,080
store which is nearest to your home and

00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,570
you will get that delivered and get that

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,970
experience the river of online into a

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,270
store so mixing both of them converging

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:06,340
both of them and it's all of it is about

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,720
how you're developing application how

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,760
you're connecting the inventory in

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,160
stores where is the data getting stored

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,990
how fast you replicate that data what is

00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,240
your data replication strategy so that

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:19,210
the information that you put in into

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,460
online that gets reflected on to the

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,560
cash register where this person is going

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,860
to be fulfilling your experience to

00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,390
think of replication think of data here

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,180
and learn and innovate we are we are

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,460
continuously learning and we we have a

00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,960
culture of learn if it doesn't work

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,700
because it's like we're talking about a

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,220
day cycle we are talking about strands

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,710
running for two or three days so it's

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,320
very fast you learn you know it and you

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,820
continue to drop the things that don't

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,320
work and then you move on with the

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:52,420
things that are working so what we have

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,210
done so far with all the transformation

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,810
so we started by reorganizing themes

00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,490
what it means is that we are very

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,130
outsource focus so we just turned it

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,800
around now we are in sourced we have a

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,870
lot of engineering talent the ratio has

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,810
reversed we used to be around 70%

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,790
offshore outs outsourced to 30% in

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,410
source his number has changed so a lot

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,480
of hiring in past two years a lot of

00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,400
people like who understand all this

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,360
technologies brought brought from all

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,770
many places means 50 60 PhDs their data

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,440
scientists and the artificial

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,930
intelligence category there are a lot of

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,790
people like you know author of spinnaker

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,790
people like who have authored like

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,590
Dockers and means from all Netflix's and

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,870
googles and Facebook and you you name

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,610
like our Cisco's our brocade so we have

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,110
people from all over working on this

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,490
technology in order to support this

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:47,290
growth very laser focused so the company

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,420
used to run in a services model which is

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,730
like project based model it went from

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:55,210
project based model

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:57,640
to say product model so we are we have

00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,160
you we have used DevOps agile and in

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,350
order to drive the products use data and

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,160
continue to use the data to focus on

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:09,190
priorities how we operate so said like

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,490
we are product model agile devops we

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,570
work like and continue to reduce our

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,090
technical debt and all the newer

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,320
applications they they are using like

00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:21,490
you know new technologies like

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,680
containers and CI senior CGI CD

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,490
pipelines near way of networking all of

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:30,520
that so how do we deliver to that

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,470
experience application and data so

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,510
everything that is our API is there

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,370
built using you know every every

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,010
application that has to be written using

00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,500
API says the interfaces externalization

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:44,380
which is like public facing and API so

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,870
as well as internal API s-- data is is a

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,640
data is all there and then we put layer

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,130
on top so that you can consume that data

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,770
so data is a service being offered to

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,770
any application that is written a risk

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,900
profiling of application and data

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,640
continuously cloud and compute we are we

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,380
are into a public cloud use private

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,930
cloud private cloud based on OpenStack

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,660
Huber netis all of that so all the

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,400
choices we we have all those options we

00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,890
make decisions every day and how do you

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,140
redesign the application and what load

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,360
goes fair through the CD ends and

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,010
through the global load balancer like

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,720
you know internal products for the

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,990
internal load balancing all of that in

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,480
action continuously use connectivity to

00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:29,020
give a consistent user experience faster

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,300
response time to over network all the

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,650
network segmentation that you that you

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,590
that you are aware of

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,780
very importantly application base VPN

00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,760
when you try to rewrite an application

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,040
and try to put some components of that

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,810
application in your private cloud for

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,020
some reason and some part in public

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:49,720
cloud your thinking about you know think

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,420
of nfe but at an application layer so

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,610
now your network becomes key security of

00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,320
your application becomes C key and how

00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,880
do you deploy that application how do

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,160
you make sure of the keys and the

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,500
security and the identity of the user

00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,030
who is deploying it and the network that

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,010
is serving it so all of that

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,320
segmentation

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,049
running an application-level I call it

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,090
application VPN so managing keys and

00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,280
managing security add application level

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:18,000
which is distributed across clouds and

00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,640
data centers identity becomes identity

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,140
Federation role based access all of that

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,500
plays a role in there because you think

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,210
about this hundreds of thousands of

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,590
customers hundreds of thousands of team

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,040
members trying to access these

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:34,530
applications identity management is very

00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,390
important or any device can be taken

00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:39,059
outside a store and then how do you kind

00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,770
of manage that identity devices all the

00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:44,100
devices that I talked about the team

00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,840
members using like iPods and Android so

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,270
writing applications for all of them the

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,250
platform that can here it's not just

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,660
public cloud or private cloud the cloud

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,030
that is sitting on your Android device

00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,890
and a team member that's a cloud for me

00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,620
that's that's a place where I have to

00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,480
deploy my platform but choice of the

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,799
platform for that device would be

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,780
different for the one that you are

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:06,030
running in public cloud or running in

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:11,040
private cloud and we are huge users are

00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:12,720
open source huge users of open source so

00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,640
the focus is an interest in

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,890
infrastructure and operations the focus

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,470
is simplifying the environment using

00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,480
open source standardizing on compute

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:24,750
storage and networking when I use what

00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,480
compute in I T word compute storage and

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,630
the elements around it they're all kind

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,280
of same we we do kind of talk about that

00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,590
Hill administrator is a network

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,059
administrator of computer storage but

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,490
lot of convergence has already happened

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,470
at least for us so we are into converge

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,840
infrastructure journey we have converged

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,630
like almost a block with compute storage

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,700
and even the networking layer has kind

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,740
of come and converged from a

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,840
software-defined perspective into kind

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,730
of compute so we have already made that

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,520
kind of journey and then lot of

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,840
performance testing and monitoring in

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,260
what makes sense in the convergent

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,820
researcher so so I believe in conversion

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,080
for searcher and we are making that

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,929
happen

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,000
relent automated infrastructure recovery

00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:12,600
so today like if somebody calls from

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,409
stole they they won't before they called

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,470
from the store there is already lot of

00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:19,570
reliability a lot of kind of

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,129
troubleshooting already happen in the

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,340
background and that us all has happened

00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:26,980
through automated recovery and automated

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,980
healing I'll quickly run through my

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,289
slides because I'm running out of time

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,330
so we we are as I said like we are we

00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:37,029
have our own API gateway that offers

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:39,970
security key management everything is

00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:42,100
like in a continuous delivery have

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,320
invested a lot if you think about ABG

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,389
for example from Google think of an

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,490
equivalent of that like you know at API

00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:52,690
gateway level so all of that developed

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,610
managed by us by my teams at Target we

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,620
do be we are a big user of spinnaker to

00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,559
do see ICD deploy pipeline our same

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,720
pipeline drops images and immutable

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,480
images across all the clouds and data

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,639
centers I talk about spinnaker pipeline

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,529
you know running drone drone kind of

00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:11,230
driving kubernetes deployment all of

00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:12,730
that has already happened because I the

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,759
hybrid cloud and the journey doesn't

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,710
happen without all of that integration

00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:21,190
so they're big users of open source like

00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:23,409
Kefka cassandra spinnaker OpenStack

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,970
human it is a lot of lot of investment

00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,679
and all of those we have a lot of

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,539
experts on their team who are working in

00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:33,309
developing this and putting that to

00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:35,649
action so open source adoption to us

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:38,230
means like it's a title to control so we

00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:39,879
can own our product delivery roadmap

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,610
because we can deploy and we are not

00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:44,740
dependent for every single key element

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,679
of our delivery on the vendors and the

00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,929
partner so our teams believe that open

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,049
source and adoption of open source has

00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:54,639
given us the CI CD and the DevOps like

00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:56,470
the way we are doing it because we

00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:58,870
wouldn't have been faster if he wouldn't

00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,490
have build those things on our own and

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:04,629
have the support of the open source

00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:06,100
platform that we have so this is a view

00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:08,799
of like you know without putting like

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,019
public clouds and clouds of how we are

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,330
connected like you know it stores to

00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:16,240
data centers to cloud we have three huge

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,769
data centers all in Minneapolis and we

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,899
are into public cloud we have our own

00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:22,600
internal public facing cloud as well

00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:26,070
they said we use OpenStack and you know

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,070
Cuban artists technologies

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,460
so using data evolution some of the

00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,440
technologies DV we are big users are

00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,600
deep learning machine learning we have

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,220
scale distributed so when you think

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,049
about stores you're really talking about

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,850
not terabytes of information you're

00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:43,760
talking about petabytes of information

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,409
in some cases almost every day and then

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,539
how do we store that information what do

00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:49,820
we drop what kind of analytics do we put

00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:51,710
on top of it that's all part of that

00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,510
whole journey I'm talking about using

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,760
data as a service it's a big big thing

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,799
for us and data is a service through

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,000
api's and making sure that it is

00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:03,649
delivering to the promise that we have

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,720
how you can help so this is a feedback

00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:07,700
as I said coming directly from the users

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,620
or from the deployment people at the

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,539
stores and other places so better

00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,640
utilization into VPN connectivity

00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:15,140
performance so we run into these

00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,760
challenge when you're trying to connect

00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,370
to different stores or to you know

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,980
clouds or data center so if the VPN goes

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,870
wrong like IPSec VPN or your MPLS VPN

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,760
there is very less kind of control we

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,110
have and what's happening there and now

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,460
think of these people who are coming

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,919
from DevOps and troubleshooting

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,240
experience they just want to know what's

00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,159
going wrong because they want to be able

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,289
to fix that so there is very less

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,970
trending and reporting like it just

00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,010
takes hours and hours to get that

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,080
troubleshooting going our clear

00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,539
recommendation so this is just very

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,309
recent so it seems like hey we are

00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:48,289
already talking about 5g but there are

00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:50,179
still challenges and you know is LTE is

00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:51,620
the right thing for us or Wi-Fi is that

00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:53,779
I think for us at this particular

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,279
location versus another location still

00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:57,140
kind of you know need more help there

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,840
like from you know service providers

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,789
offering managed services to us selves

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,799
are offering we would like to if if

00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:06,200
you're bringing applications if you want

00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:08,480
us to use software as a service please

00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,730
make it a you know self self-serve

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,549
experience for us because we have moved

00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:15,649
pretty fast in agile and the DevOps word

00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:17,539
self serving is really the key how do

00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:19,640
you consume being very prescriptive and

00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:21,740
how do we use applications and make it

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,960
easy to support those services give the

00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,880
same experience don't it's it's today

00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,130
it's a different experience for on-prem

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,169
troubleshooting versus off prem or how

00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,480
do we consume on Prem versus off Prem

00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:34,279
that takes a lot of time two days of

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,080
kind of training here and one day kind

00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,460
of training there that's a lot of time

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,260
and different kind of focus that

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,670
requires so a consistent

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,980
perience for deploying and

00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,180
troubleshooting on trim off prem so

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,560
those are some of the things that I

00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,990
believe like you know would help our

00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,560
teams so with that like thank you very

00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:53,550
much

00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,550
