Description: 
	Keynote: Five Trends Enabled By 5G That Will Change Networking Forever - Dr. Jan Uddenfeldt, President & CEO, jUTechnology (Innovator, Entrepreneur, Board Advisor to Startups)

As an innovator wireless technologies Dr Uddenfeldt has pioneered several  disruptions such as GSM and 3G/4G LTE mobile broadband.  As the current disruption with open network, SDN/NFV and cloud technologies moves into mass adoption, we are at the footsteps of the next revolution enabled by key technologies like 5G. Wireless 5G will include Gbps broadband as well as narrowband IoT with a need to accommodate 100 B devices. New applications such as AI and VR will require very low latency in the networks. Those trends will change networking and it is important to have new architectures such as distributed cloud. Connectivity is no longer sufficient. Automation, Life-cycle Management, Granularity coupled with massive scale are inherent ingredients of how Networks of the future will be built.

well thank you very much good morning

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,500
everyone that was fantastic I hope you

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,170
woke up as well so so that's pretty good

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,950
to see all of you know it's a pleasure

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,350
for me to be here and discuss a little

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,840
bit about the future and of course I

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,320
think got a really good introduction

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,930
from our Pete but also from from Sandra

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,390
talking about 5g is here now and that's

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,730
really what we have to realize and and

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,740
how do we see the implication for the

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,219
networks I think that that's that's what

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,059
we have to really discuss first a little

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,280
bit about my my my background yes I'm a

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,670
wireless guy I kind of worked a lot with

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,750
the wireless technologies and back in

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:52,680
the late 80s GSM basically came out of

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:56,370
my my lab at at Ericsson so that that

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,100
created is this fantastic evolution that

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,559
we that we saw but that was voice only

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,470
kind of thing so anyway after that I

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,780
became the CTO for Ericsson and that I

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,780
had like 15 years and that was during

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,070
the time when we invented 3G 4G those

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,720
things we actually called mobile

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,490
broadband because you know this was not

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,400
voice and what we have took it to the

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,720
next level realizing that internet was

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,270
going to change things and and of course

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,540
it really didn't and and that just

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,520
created the continued success but of

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,770
course we invented a lot of other things

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,430
like like Bluetooth what happened those

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,700
things but then then of course then a

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,950
little bit later I moved to to Silicon

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,920
Valley still being with with Ericsson

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,770
and then I found out a couple of things

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,490
one was really this these these people

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,280
working on on open flow and that of

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,079
course had a very profound impact and we

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,479
started to work very close together with

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,320
Nigeria and so on from from Ericsson

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,840
point of view and really I mean that

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,729
that that was a fantastic revolution we

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,439
had done similar things with with what

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,939
we call soft switch in the in the in the

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,129
circus which world but that wasn't

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,379
really driving the applications that was

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,110
just to tour to separate the control

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,090
plane and the and the data path of

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,650
but this was more more much more

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:23,190
profound so anyway then I started to to

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,080
work with with with Sony mobile and that

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,310
was really working a lot together with

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,990
with the Android team at Google and that

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,600
was really open source although it was a

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,550
little bit different it was one

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,100
organization creating most of it but and

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,340
it's was done in a fantastic way by by

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:45,060
bringing all these vendors as as

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,160
partners and and the whole open-source

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,140
way of doing it the way that Andy Rubin

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,420
drove these things and started from

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,060
scratch created a new operating system

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,390
and making it even the fantastic success

00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,030
of course along with with with iPhone

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,860
but nevertheless this was very very fast

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,250
and I think that was a tremendous thing

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,910
to really be a be part of that to see

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,580
what open-source can really create and

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:14,390
now I'm I'm more working with being

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,770
advisory on company boards and so on

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,480
still with some big companies but also

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,150
with a lot of startups here in the

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,459
valley and and of course these are or

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,250
from very diverse areas because I've

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,230
been covering both Network and consumer

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,350
electronics so I work with of course

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,780
algae IOT cloud the technology but also

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,330
with with more things coming coming from

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,420
the end-user perspective like AI and VR

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,630
a or and so on so let's talk a little

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,060
bit about this thing about because this

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,820
is all about in my world it's all it's

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,890
all about disruption and innovation and

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,600
and that's that's that's really this is

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,700
not the end of it I think we are having

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,230
some very interesting journey ahead of

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,360
us

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,739
if you look at a mobile computing this

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,080
is where you can see these these

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,080
generation starting with we like you

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,239
know text and voice really moving in to

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,970
touch base phones by the way they came

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,459
along before iPhone although they had a

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,380
pen so I think that was a big thing that

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,630
that changed the world with getting rid

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,760
of the pen but actually when we invented

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,979
3G of course we had to have some some

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,229
much much more advanced phones so they

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:25,160
were they were like touch based phones

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,880
but what really happened then with with

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,130
having a small

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,770
tones very advanced smartphones like

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,340
Android and iPhone definitely was that

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,810
only thing about being really connected

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,600
to internet and having all these video

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,220
that kind of exploded because in the

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,710
previous days we didn't really have a

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,860
food browser and things so that that

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,040
that that changed it and now of course

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,270
we have all seen that evolution going on

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,670
for the last 10 years

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,670
looking ahead though I mean things like

00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:00,780
AR and VR will have a very large impact

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:04,260
on on the whole evolution from the from

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,140
the end user perspective if we look at

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:11,040
the the network you know all these G's

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:14,430
2g 3G 4G 4G basically what I have spent

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,760
a lot of my time I mean we have to

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,130
realize that that these this evolution

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,750
we have seen is basically six orders of

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:28,170
magnitude of data rate increase during

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,880
during the years so it started like 2g

00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,740
was basically like 10 kilobits per

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,680
second and now we talk about foggy which

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,560
is like 10 gigabits so that's that's six

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,890
orders of magnitude and of course that

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,170
has a fantastic large impacts on what

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,360
what you can do and with with the things

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,210
we can see on the on the left hand side

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,990
what going from from voice to web to to

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:55,080
to video and now further to to to new

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,960
things but it's also very important to

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,870
realize that at the same time there has

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,900
been a very strong evolution on the on

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,120
the network side I think 2g kind of

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,910
built on the circus fish world however

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,900
what it really did was to create a

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,640
global mobile world and and with roaming

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,740
and all of these things so that was a

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,760
pretty big step in itself to really

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,070
create all of that and of course then

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:27,660
merging like the Internet world and the

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:30,750
mobile world into 3G 4G using tcp/ip

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,870
that that definitely helped everything

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,310
to align these two worlds and of course

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,040
now we have seen the last couple of

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,800
years that Sdn and if we is having a

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,819
profound impact moving to too

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,440
of course that's like John Donovan

00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,240
mentioned yesterday that really means

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,300
that that this is the first time that

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,400
you really can have a modern

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,289
architecture and and network

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,470
architecture when you are deploying a

00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,610
new radio technology which is has not

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,680
been the case in the past it's always

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,270
been like an evolution so this is really

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,220
interesting we can create all of these

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:08,789
things that we talked about and we can

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:12,330
get rid of some of the the old stuff

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:15,150
that we don't have to took to carry any

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,879
longer however we also have to realize

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,330
that all these things about foggy also

00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,409
put a lot of things or networking

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,419
implications that we heard a little bit

00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:27,060
about yesterday and this morning as well

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,969
so we have to realize it it will be

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,469
quite different you're only going going

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:36,539
ahead so what will the the next big

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:38,849
thing well I would say distributed cloud

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,280
I think there are many words for this

00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:44,550
that people use very different words to

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,740
really explain what it is and what I

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,139
think it's it's self-explanatory if you

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,270
use the word distributed cloud so

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,710
basically of course I will then try to

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,370
talk a little bit what what are the

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,349
trends that are leading up to this

00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,159
distributed clouds things like Saji IOT

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:04,139
AI V or AR so I will I will spend a

00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,830
little bit of time on each each one of

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:10,770
those I think sorry we have heard I mean

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:14,310
if you look at file G it is happening

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,680
now it's it's just around the corner and

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,900
this is a new network it's new radio and

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,759
of course there are it's a it's a you

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,710
know from the application point of view

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,690
it's going to be different so on a radio

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,810
perspective is like 10 times higher data

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,909
rates it's 10 times lower date latency

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,099
so basically we talk about more than 10

00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,979
gigabits per second we talk about less

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,449
than one millisecond so I you know

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,729
there's a lot of things you can you can

00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:40,949
do with these things there are some

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:44,219
challenges on the radio side because in

00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:45,750
order to to generate all of these data

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,790
rates of course it's also important to

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,440
go up to higher higher frequency bands

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,510
which has its own challenges but

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,699
nevertheless I think that is that is

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,779
really happening only on the network

00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,180
side again

00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,069
this is basically building an opensource

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,779
we don't have to carry all the all the

00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:02,670
old stuff around we can really think

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:07,529
about virtualization and cloud you know

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:12,420
in in a very creative way and and and

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:14,279
that is driving this whole new world on

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,680
the application side I think basically

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,649
this is not only mobile any longer this

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,569
is going beyond mobile this will be that

00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,389
will be fixed wireless because anyway

00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:27,660
you fibre is very expensive if you if

00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:30,809
you really want to do fixed networks and

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,629
and deploy residential broadband to the

00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:36,809
homes outside cities or large city

00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:38,970
studies then Wireless is much more

00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:41,490
attractive and that is big it is really

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,470
becoming obvious so so that that's going

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,480
to have a very important impact but

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,339
there is also these verticals that many

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,470
people have talked about that is

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,209
definitely for for enterprise that's

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,240
going to drive things and I will touch

00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:56,339
upon some of some of them but basically

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,100
of course five 5g is going to have a

00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:03,569
major impact on on on the on the

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:06,629
distributed automated network so another

00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:08,160
thing is IOT and well it may be hard to

00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:11,339
see all the numbers but of course we are

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,850
this is like 50 50 billion devices

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:17,009
pretty soon and of course they're going

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,620
to generate traffic and some of them are

00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:22,529
just not generate you know some of these

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,930
devices are actually more like sensors

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,949
and so on and they are very very many of

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,689
them and they're going to be all over

00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:31,019
the place going to require a lot of

00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:33,029
signaling but not necessarily so so so

00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,089
many bytes but nevertheless you can see

00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:38,129
that even on their only bytes

00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,740
perspective it is actually driving up

00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,360
traffic although the main traffic is

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,519
still coming coming from other sources

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:51,629
like you like you like video now IOT is

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,120
a buzzword it's being useful for for for

00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:56,040
many many different things some of the

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,679
things around IOT or force more like

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,259
indoor applications only but it was

00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,509
important that to realize that for that

00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:08,520
for wide area outdoor applications there

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:10,320
is also a big need for for for IOT so

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,720
then there are some some new

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,790
technologies being developed by the

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,120
standardization organization like the

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:21,210
3gpp has launched this new narrowband

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,340
LTE technology and what that really

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,910
means is low-power wide area so you can

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:29,040
extremely low-power like like it devices

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,800
can can can be out there for four ten

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,800
years basically until you forget about

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,290
them right so so so then you just lit

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,790
that let them be there and then then

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,130
then you can with something else and

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,110
this is for consumer devices of course

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,960
like legs here like wearables but but

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,870
also for a lot of enterprise IOT sensors

00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,120
being done for for asset tracking smart

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,460
cities or retail with a lot about retail

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,710
and in the last presentation and and

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,790
different kinds of transportation and so

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:02,190
on so of course this is definitely gonna

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,230
change and it's going to drive the

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,540
future when it comes to a number of

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,510
devices out there in the in the world

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:12,840
this is low speed technology but again

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,450
it it does require a lot of signaling so

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,790
it does require that you have more

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,290
distributed network to really take care

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,920
of all of these things and you don't

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:25,670
want to have everything up up up lowly

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:30,750
because it's so many devices out there

00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:32,670
then I think the VRA or this slide is

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,120
just kind of highlighting the fact that

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,220
this is going to have a profound impact

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,560
of course these these numbers are all

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,560
pretty big and I don't know exactly how

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,100
fast it is going to take normally things

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,050
you know happen a little bit slower than

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,740
you think but once they come it goes

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,600
very very fast so very actually I think

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,010
we definitely going to see numbers like

00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,660
like like this out there and VR it's a

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,300
little bit smaller than a are on this

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,400
chart here but of course we if you can

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,800
see it just looking at from the device

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,530
point of view it's it's it's pretty big

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,200
and it's it and it's happening already

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,150
because we have really advanced your

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,000
devices out there on the market already

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,580
now and then of course we can see that

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,700
the implication of that is starting to

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,520
happen

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,380
now in this we have to realize that we

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,070
are a or is quite different from

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,150
ordinary video because video

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,550
distribution when you do that like with

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,950
using CDN technology and and so on I

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,500
mean real time is not so important you

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,140
can have a little bit of of latency

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,260
doesn't really matter so much but for

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,720
these applications it does so you it's

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,280
very important to have low latency for

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,190
instance VR if you have if you have

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,920
glasses and you can I mean the way it's

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,690
supposed to be when you have three 360s

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,610
if you move your head you should really

00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,470
follow right because otherwise you get

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,290
you get dizzy so you have to get a new

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:06,100
scene within a couple of milliseconds so

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:09,220
that's pretty hard latency restrictions

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,290
on a are similar you really are looking

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,200
at the virtual world and the real world

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,730
at the same time and and and and this

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,380
does have to be kind of kind of

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,240
synchronized if you have too much delay

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,370
you have you have it you have a similar

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,320
problem so I mean when you're just

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,020
watching video you are kind of you're

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,030
kind of doing it without having to worry

00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,310
about the latency but these applications

00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,920
are really talking about very low

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,900
latency so it's really completely

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,850
different and it's going to drive this

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,390
whole thing about the distributed cloud

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:43,720
of course so if you look a little bit

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:47,590
about AI as well and come back to the

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,990
bit V or AR but of course AI is kind of

00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:53,170
is kind of similar

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:56,920
as humans we always expect very fast

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,810
response and and and I mean going to

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,410
computer that might might be even more

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:04,150
so like we like I think I mean Lee from

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,130
Google mentioned yesterday so of course

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,860
this is not restricted just to just to

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,900
AI but nevertheless you talk about AI

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,670
and all these applications that are

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,610
related to to to humans

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:17,800
it does require low low latency that

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,630
goes for that goes for voice interfaces

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,760
it goes for things like like face

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,670
recognition you don't really want to be

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,390
kind of bothered about but these these

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:30,400
delays and of course for things like

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,980
what Animus driving is definitely

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,690
profound and that's also what Sandra

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,080
talked about I mean we talked about the

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,910
Kinect

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,760
car and some of those applications but

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,850
you know go to autonomous driving it's

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,700
it's even it's even more than that and

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,740
so all of these things basically means

00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,750
that we are talking about the new world

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,780
with with very different requirements

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:57,400
and I think definitely you can you can

00:15:52,780 --> 00:16:00,780
say that the way to look upon this is

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:05,770
and network has to have to change

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:07,210
quite quite much now on the VRA our side

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,900
of course I think I already mentioned

00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:13,030
this is the seasickness problem that

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,000
that you can experience if you don't

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:18,490
have very low I mean you really need

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,440
very low latency for that and we can

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,100
understand or experience from from from

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,100
Playstation and oculus and so on and so

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,290
that's really of course if you have if

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,810
you just have it in the inspector calls

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:35,110
that's one thing but go into online then

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:39,220
it puts rate these requirements to the

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:41,680
network instead and again you're granted

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,860
reality is it's very similar so we

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,770
talked about high speed low latency and

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,840
of course automated so this has to be

00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:53,290
very intelligent but definitely the

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,380
network has to handle handle low latency

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:59,200
and of course high speed I think fargy

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,950
is then of course the number one vehicle

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,600
for that but if the network cannot

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,120
follow follow through and do the same

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,209
thing then then it you know it doesn't

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,110
really help so so I think definitely

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:16,870
it's becoming very obvious that we have

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:20,650
to focus on getting the distributed

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,480
clouds out there and this is I guess

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,270
starting with with things like the

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,070
central office and also following

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,040
through with the with the base station

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:32,110
so basically we can we can do it at the

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,880
edge people call it different things of

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:38,380
course I mean mobile edge computing

00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,210
multi multi axis edge computing and I

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,980
think Sandra had a little bit different

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,380
wording as well but but but these things

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,200
are all really driving driving it and

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,600
from the capacity and latency point of

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,640
view I mean we have to realize

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:57,670
this has this has been the kind of way

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,640
of working for for all mobile mobile

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:04,390
networks and that when you do this

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,010
single on on a mobile network syncs when

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,910
it comes to latency when it comes to

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:12,880
direct access it requires so much higher

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,740
higher response time and effort shorter

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,140
response time if you say so of course

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:21,700
that is things that we will continue to

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:24,130
to also see and it's really great to see

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,190
that open networks are now being

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,690
embraced by the by the telecom world I

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,950
think that is fantastic it takes a

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,560
little while you know everything case

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,840
why like we heard from from Morton

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,280
yesterday morning he was a little bit

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,810
embarrassed that it took so long time

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,150
but it does you know I mean you have to

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,560
be you have to realize that and and and

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,330
of course now we can see that the

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,470
tradition of standardization forums such

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:49,570
as 3gpp and so on or of course working

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,180
very close together with with the open

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,060
network fora so I think that that's

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:58,480
that's really the way to create the

00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,570
future and I think just to have a closer

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,360
relation continue to have even even

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,520
better relation and then of course I

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,670
think the the harmonization between

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,680
different open Network for us could also

00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,990
be very important has been a little bit

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,970
fragmented but to speed up it and

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,850
aspetta tool to really harmonize and

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:21,190
then I think of course we have we all

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,890
have to realize that it's good to focus

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,390
on the end-to-end application again I

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,270
mean Morton talked about that yesterday

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,040
morning that that to be generally a

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,890
little bit tough sometimes you have to

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,440
focus and and I think that that's also

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:39,130
very good advice for for for doing

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:43,510
things for the next generation so with

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:47,280
that I think I have tried to be the tool

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:51,190
to give this this message about the

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,200
distributed cloud so I'm I'm happy to

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:57,200
take in all right guys okay it's like

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,820
round of applause you

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,770
if you don't mind staying here I have a

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:07,200
couple of questions before we open it

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:09,330
now you know you said it takes a while

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,130
and that's one thing I know Silicon

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,070
Valley does not have which is patience I

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,280
know right and a lot of people here in

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,710
the audience I'm sure some of them may

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,630
not even be born when 2g or 3u is there

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,840
right so what advice do you have for

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:27,270
them what should they do okay

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,470
well I mean what should you do of course

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:33,179
how to be a successful I would say still

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,720
is just to be first you know you have to

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:39,270
innovate and be first so then you have

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,340
you know if you don't do that then of

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,740
then of course that it's very hard to

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,200
really be very very successful that has

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,030
been the mode to I have been working

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,320
with all these early years you have to

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,660
be first you have to innovate you have

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,160
to be first and of course sometimes it

00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,290
takes a little bit longer than you think

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,940
and that that's the thing you have to be

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,410
a little bit you have to be a little bit

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,210
perseverance kind of kind of with those

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,480
things because networks takes takes a

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:10,020
while so it's so big of course so that's

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,059
that's that's one thing another thing of

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,580
course you have to you're you know I

00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,840
mean it's not how do you do this you

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,730
cannot just say I'm going to innovate

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,890
and and be first because sometimes you

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,360
actually to early also if you if the

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,100
technology is not ready what the market

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,049
is not earlier you are you are too early

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,179
so but of course also it's very

00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:29,820
important that you are that you have to

00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,450
be best you really have to make sure

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,570
that pick your pick your area and pick

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:38,429
your subject and try to work in that and

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:40,380
learn it and be this because if you are

00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:44,100
best you can you know it's really hard

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,570
to to object to what you are to what

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,820
you're doing so I don't know I mean it's

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,620
very it's very hard to give advice but I

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,780
mean you know these these are some of

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,360
the things love it now we love it so we

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,510
have questions pretty sure Michael hi

00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,260
Michael heart from my chest market and

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:03,750
when we met before it was in phonetics

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,000
when you were at Ericsson but dr. Yanna

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,370
I have this question now every time I

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,680
hear the 5g

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:14,610
edge computing high-bandwidth

00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:18,650
millimeter-wave it seems to me it

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:20,309
requires deep fiber fiber ization out

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,550
everywhere really

00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:25,860
and but nobody talks about it at these

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,620
conferences maybe they talk about it at

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,930
optical conference I don't know but I

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,690
don't go to those anymore but what do

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,820
you think about that is it does the

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,410
industry just expect that fiber is going

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,670
to be out there close enough that the

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:43,950
short distance of millimeter wave well

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,020
yeah I mean you're absolutely right of

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,940
course I mean going to millimeter wave

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,470
is these frequency bands about 20

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:55,080
gigahertz definitely the the range of

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,030
the radio you know the coverage of the

00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,950
radio will be much smaller so so you

00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,480
need much more base stations actually

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,000
and they have to be shaped and small and

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,070
lots of them or at least many of them

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,050
and then of course fiber is the right

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,470
way to really connect them yeah I would

00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,840
say so

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,460
absolutely so that will be fiber maybe

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,690
not fiber to the home but fiber to the

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,740
hub or whatever you want to call it

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,300
fiber to the base station yeah thank you

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,440
very much for your talk for each thing

00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:25,500
from telefÃ³nica your insight about

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,530
distributed clouds our customers utilize

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,750
services and their experiences on those

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,760
services are enough with Google and

00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,100
Facebook and obviously those are OTT

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,940
players so the question to you is do you

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:42,870
not think it's time for the OTT players

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:46,860
to come to the party and work with telco

00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:49,230
operators on these distributed clouds in

00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,940
that set of central offices and this

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,210
does mean that the OTT players have to

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,410
give up a piece of the pie which I mean

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,780
they did a really good job in the last

00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:00,120
10 years but to support all of this I

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,630
mean for virtual reality in a virtual

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,940
reality players have to build and build

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,440
their architecture which supports

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,450
distributed cloud and that means that

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,400
they have to give a piece of the pie so

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,250
telco so do you not think that now it's

00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,560
time for them to kind of say let's work

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,220
together well of course I mean I should

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,900
not answer on their on their behalf but

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,580
definitely I think we see I mean

00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:27,150
I think it was really good to see now

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,760
the how how AT&T or presenting the way

00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,740
forward for the telco industry and a lot

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,810
of cooperation around that at the same

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,820
time we also see Google have very strong

00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,100
plans for what they are planning to do

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,380
on the only public cloud you know this

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,780
is Silicon Valley and of course people

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,030
drive their own agenda so it's not that

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,160
simple all the time to just bring people

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,050
to the party but I mean you have to ask

00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:53,810
them right I cannot answer on their

00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:56,370
behalf but it might not be so easy okay

00:24:53,810 --> 00:25:01,470
thank you very good

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:03,360
perfect answer from from the techie all

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:06,980
right thank you very much good thank you

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,980
