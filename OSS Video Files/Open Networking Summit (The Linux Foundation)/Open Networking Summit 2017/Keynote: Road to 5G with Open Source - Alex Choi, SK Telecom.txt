	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
so I am from South Korea just for those

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,900
who are not so familiar with my company

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,049
SK Telecom we are the leading operator

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,170
Chauhan operator in Korea both fixed and

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,710
mobile combined occupying approximately

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,529
50% market share and we also one of the

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,869
three IPTV service providers and now we

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:30,330
are pursuing and moving forward to the

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:32,640
next era which is a 5g so even if the 5g

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,710
first global space specification is

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,920
still under development and expect it to

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,379
be done by the end of hopefully this

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,530
year and then the major rollout

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:48,270
worldwide war out probably will start to

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:52,350
begin like year 2020 or later on but you

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,390
know this year 2017 it seems to be a

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,050
very important milestone as far as the

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,289
5g community operator community concerns

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,040
because you will see you will see the

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,409
real trial services sometime this year

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,530
and here and there here in America and

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:14,600
in this Korea you know so this is a

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:18,450
major milestone we are very much excited

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,460
but knowing that the ecosystem is not

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,130
fully ready yet we have to fully

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,460
understand what risk is what risks we

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,610
are dealing with so so today I'm gonna

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,880
use my presentation to explain you about

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,820
our thoughts about what part time shift

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:47,159
we try to Institute during the course of

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:51,210
about 5 G Network rollout so starting

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:55,950
from this slice I presume that these are

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,600
the key initiative we are pursuing but

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,729
most of you are already familiar with

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,740
all these that you know keywords so

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,810
unbundling open source software ization

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,550
and clarification those are the four

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:11,700
major initiatives that we try to you

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,090
know implement embrace because this is a

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,640
perfect opportunity

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,780
for us to changed our track network

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,769
architectures and do things right this

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,629
time right so open source you know you

00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,420
know what that means softer ideation

00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:30,040
clarification very straightforward

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,560
unbundling is very tricky things you

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,220
know a lot of unbundling or

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,220
democratization is already done on the

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,739
data center side they an open source

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,590
community has an excellent job including

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:47,829
hardware and software Democrat izing the

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:52,599
company is you know convention or data

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:54,670
center and transform it to a very you

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,269
know flexible and agile program upper

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,500
and operation efficient cloud systems

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:04,299
and the open source community

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,099
you really must be very proud of it you

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:08,950
are the one who actually make that

00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:11,620
happens but can you expect the same

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,890
unbundling democratization on the

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,889
opposite side which is a radio access

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,920
network side which actually the major

00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:24,519
portion of operator TCO total cost of

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,290
ownership because you know when you

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,079
speak when you talk about ready access

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,420
unit you have to deal with many many

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:34,870
operation problems including sell-side

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:38,590
occasion and installing the equipment's

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:41,139
antennas and did calibrations and also

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,750
you have to regularly dispatch your

00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:47,500
engineers making sure everything is

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:51,130
operating well so that make things are

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:56,440
very difficult for operators to you know

00:03:51,130 --> 00:04:00,040
to aggressively go for the you know

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,639
access network unbundling but it's time

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,859
to to make it happen so we asked a

00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,310
telecom together with other operator

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:11,760
friends we started unbundling many

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,730
unbundling project here and there and

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,930
open source technologies also it's gonna

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:22,390
be a very crucial ingredient doing so

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:27,010
but what makes unbundling difficult and

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:29,920
other area the domain is because the

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,260
specification is not being developed

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,950
here it's being developed by other

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:39,430
community which is a 3gpp and very into

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,680
semi open community but anyway it's and

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,230
also the specification is very happy and

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,380
you have to make sure you have support

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:50,020
and all backward compatibility for the

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:54,340
compatibility and also the existing

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,410
network equipment vendors they are

00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:01,140
trying very hard chain try to change

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:06,340
themselves and try to be become more IT

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,720
centric vendors but then still there is

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,240
a lot of not just the technical

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,650
challenges but also culture challenges

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:23,350
and operation challenges I'm gonna

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:25,270
address that later on and so we came up

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,680
a skate elico we came up with the two

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:33,070
important architectures named me this as

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,980
scale and cost cosmos so on the right

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,900
hand side bottom you see known as scale

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,750
and cosmos so as scale

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,470
it's a overlay network architectures

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,780
where as the commerce cosmos is underlay

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,060
you know clarify the software eyes you

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,910
know softer eyes the platform

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,580
architectures I'll talk about that so

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,670
here's the whole board picture of what

00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:02,470
is right aura is mentioned that scale

00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:06,550
and cosmos so as you know if you're a

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:12,010
key operating exactly to what concern

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:15,820
you had now when it comes to you know

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:20,890
may making a decision on the big

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:24,210
investments like a 5g want is you want

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:27,490
to achieve

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:32,310
agile new service introductions new

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:37,620
service introductions so that's one

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:40,100
important agenda the second is a

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,370
significant TCO

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,800
efficiency and savings like I said

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:51,110
access network comprise most part of a

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:54,440
whole TCO so you have to you have to you

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:58,000
have to you know be very cautious that

00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,710
and and last but not least is the

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,170
consumer experience quality or

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,860
satisfaction so those are the three

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:10,820
priorities and top of my you know in in

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,490
their mind they expected mine so how our

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,090
has Katie's architectures you know s

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:22,400
scale and cosmos combined can can

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:25,030
deliver that that achieved at targets so

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,190
a scale like a set is mobile a

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,760
architectures it comprised

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:34,990
next-generation OSS which is big big

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,670
there data on ethics based and

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,250
networking slicing and software-defined

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,590
R and s 2 n and software-defined their

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,800
core software define core is a

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,020
relatively straightforward because

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,030
thanks to the Sdn and NFV technology

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,890
whereas Software Defined the Ren is very

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,110
tricky because it's a it's not

00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,930
especially the phone hall side back

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,270
horse is still a lot of you know closed

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,650
the architectures it's it's supposed to

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,040
be open architecture but the in

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,560
realities is not that open yet so we

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,540
need to democratise all these interfaces

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,630
between the different building blocks

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,750
horizontally and vertically and you know

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,820
control plane use a plane I you know

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,860
personally I would like to introduce a

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,740
new plane called the radio plane which

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:30,380
is less addressed during the whole

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:32,330
summit here this week so and the cosmos

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,400
is our software-defined interest in

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,530
faster it's not just open source

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,440
hardware but also just software-defined

00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:46,750
investors based on open hardware

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:49,910
softwares so this is a more detailed

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,520
diagram so

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:58,240
and let me skip this but I'd like to

00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:02,870
emphasize the importance of in 5g how we

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,120
how we should do the function splitting

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,120
between the axis net I mean the

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,050
centralized the access unit and remote

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,720
unit so remote Union up until 4G or its

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:18,200
evolution so we only have just a direct

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,640
component there and used very expensive

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:26,180
fiber based from all to transmit

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,860
received and digitized data signals to

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,930
the central data processing unit and

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:37,790
there is a high performance constraint

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:40,850
on the foot on the front hold a so so

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,440
it's gonna be important in 5g we have to

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,680
loosen up all those performance

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:49,220
constraints so that we can replace it

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:53,690
with the commodity front-hall such as

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:56,980
carrier ethernet so and then to achieve

00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:01,390
that you have to be very what I know you

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:04,040
have to be very smart splitting of

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,620
functionalities for the basement

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,920
processing so you have to move some

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,790
portion of l1 processing to the radio

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,770
remote unit site and then leave some

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,870
functionalities on that data processing

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,710
side but you don't want to centralize

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:25,190
data set disease and data you know these

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:29,180
30 units today you want to centralize it

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:34,430
to the extent possible right so that

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:37,970
part is a very tricky so and what is so

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,190
I mean you know in the conventional

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,500
cloud architectures

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,900
there are three resources you are

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,340
dealing with right the compute and

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:54,710
storage and network but you forgot to

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:57,040
incorporate radio as a no resources one

00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,050
of the resources you have managed

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,390
because of that your cloud architectures

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,150
cannot penetrate into the access network

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,140
today

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:11,610
so you have to introduce this radio

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:14,220
resource as a part of your you know

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,470
resourcefully mechanisms so otherwise

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:26,490
that you know you cannot properly

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:29,279
address the radio access domain so now

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:32,300
I'd like to emphasize that the

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,470
significance of a thirteen so too

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:39,750
because the radio is the most precious

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:42,210
asset and resources from mobile operator

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:46,650
perspective first it's very expensive to

00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:51,270
acquire second is may get even more

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:54,660
expensive and cert is the more spectrum

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:58,589
you have the more from haul-back whole

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:02,160
networks you need but that requires a

00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:05,279
huge TCO increase Minh so overall you

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,940
know more spectrum means more tissues so

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:13,950
how you can deal with you know this kind

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:18,270
of undesirable teach your increase so if

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:20,700
you do things right and if you properly

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:24,230
embrace the radio resource as part of

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,089
your you know cloud resource management

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,400
framework then you can do much better

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:32,910
job and there won't be any

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,920
customizations today's no to embrace the

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,000
cloud in all the innovations done and

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,580
data center can be applied to the ready

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,410
access unit but it requires a lot of

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,360
customizations because there is no

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:53,400
research radio resource management

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:55,410
scheme there so and SK you know this

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,630
lies best very PG is pretty much

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:01,490
self-explanatory

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:06,810
but this week you know I recognize that

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:11,100
this radio side is less addressed than

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:14,490
any other topics so once again I'd like

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:17,520
to you know underline the importance of

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,930
addressing this space because this is

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,550
the where you can find the use of

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,310
business opportunities and also

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,820
technology innovations and also more

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,430
healthful healthy ecosystems

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,730
cultivations so our radio access network

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:39,600
software-defined radio access network

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:42,600
initiative comprised fiber projects open

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,960
front all my cassette and modular ready

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,210
a remote access unit and control plane

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,280
user praying separation through standard

00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,110
interfaces X Ren

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,370
there is a activity called the X ray and

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:58,710
they've done a good job to make this

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:01,860
this happened and they introduced this

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:05,190
kind of a notion of Ren server which is

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:08,610
a very good and the cert is open

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,310
hardware software I mean the white box

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:15,180
parameter also be compliant hardware is

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:17,700
a it's a very appropriate but still they

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,450
are lack of certain requirements that

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,770
mobile operator need you know so like

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:29,130
you know six nine reliability or

00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:32,600
something like that and so still there's

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:35,040
some areas that needs to be further

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,800
improved you know there's you know

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,510
mobile operator to true were

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,930
aggressively adopted the open hardware

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,690
software la and mobile computing you

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,660
know someone also introduced the mobile

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:51,420
computing it's a it's not a mobile

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,880
computing it's a multiple access action

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,030
meaning that you can you know multiple

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,740
act multiple access each competing can

00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:02,070
embrace not just the mobile but also

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,510
fixed-line any media broadcasting line

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:09,540
you know broadcasting network so it's a

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:15,330
the concept is being or broaden today

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:17,490
and but last last panelist is a

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,880
narrative space the self-organizing

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,590
network this is the area this is the

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,970
domain that your machine learning

00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:31,190
technology can be fully exploited and

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,280
lifecycle management and the changes

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:39,520
I think it's to come to business life so

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:43,970
let me skip it and cosmos is underlay

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,220
you know architectures that I mean just

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:49,570
mentioned so it looks like a

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:53,690
conventional cloud architectures but we

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:58,490
we have done some customizations to to

00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:00,560
to to use this or to cloud the

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:07,880
convention architectures for the mobile

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:10,610
network so and open source we we have

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:18,010
been taking advantage of all this no

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:20,330
priority of open source solutions and

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:24,230
I'm gonna spend few minutes

00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:26,150
you know SK Telecom's activities and in

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:30,520
the space of open source communities so

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:33,340
we are participating into many many

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:38,540
different open source community

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:42,110
including honest court ho CP t IP which

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:46,340
happen you know that currently sharing

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:52,540
the port and the OpenStack and the RP

00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:54,260
inappropri and explain maybe own app - I

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:59,150
haven't decided yet

00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:03,050
but it looks quite promising to me so

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:08,020
I'm not so this is M court we together

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:11,800
with our operator and very you know and

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:15,050
vendor innovators support we are able to

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:19,100
successfully showcase this at the Mobile

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:21,199
World Congress March this years and we I

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,760
strongly believe a week in our

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,939
abstractions and it proves that

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,820
discardable

00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:33,410
you know new architecture open source

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:37,100
based and already acts you know mobile

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:41,150
network works well not just functionally

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:44,200
but also operation wise and we are very

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:48,759
proud of being part that is pi

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:52,570
companies and there were some real

00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:57,309
páginas cases and use cases this is very

00:17:52,570 --> 00:18:00,940
important to when you talk to your your

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:03,580
supervisors because because 5g really

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:07,600
will require a huge investment capex and

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,249
OPEX so as it's a it's very important

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,369
you have to come up with some compelling

00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:15,039
stories and also you have to you know

00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:17,679
with this kind of understanding about

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,519
what business opportunities you can

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,279
achieve how the 5g you can feel more

00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,279
comfortable as an engineer so you can do

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:31,139
your job better right once you feel more

00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:34,629
confident and we are also actively

00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:36,549
participating in some other open source

00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:39,340
project as well kubernetes and sap

00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:43,149
especially the Kuban does kubernetes

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:48,429
side we decided to use it for our you

00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:53,350
know cloud systems and also separ

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:56,350
is our flash storage ii software-defined

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,269
storage solutions previously its cost

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,480
it's optimized for the hard-disk

00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:03,549
now we are trying to donate our code so

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,679
that it can much more optimized for the

00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:12,940
no more new storage systems which is a

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,619
flash-based and tip like I said can

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,590
currently are sharing these activities

00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:21,909
and very proud of it and you know we

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:24,359
have a very good partner of colleague

00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:27,129
operators like a Deutsche Telekom and

00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,289
and also you know a lot of our products

00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:31,840
other operators start to join it

00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:36,279
including telefónica or ng port phone

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,059
and BT and some others so it's a it's a

00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,259
organically growing and also

00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:44,109
functionally it's also growing as well

00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:46,960
so there is a many new project group

00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:51,720
today and as you can see on this chart

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:56,220
the lab they're the right-hand side

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,220
means that the access network and

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,000
left-hand side

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,390
sorry left inside is excess metal and

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
from your side and right inside is is a

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:11,230
core network and in the middle it's a

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,160
peg hole so as you see we have a many

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:17,980
more project group on the XS side

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,100
meaning that we are truly a focusing on

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:25,470
this access network democratization and

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:29,530
unbundling and embracing open source

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,700
hardware and software so we are very

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,520
excited about it

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:41,230
this you know every year we are holding

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:46,360
you know tips I mean so you would be

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:49,030
welcome if you know join us and like I

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,380
said 4G bundling project is one of the

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:57,970
focusing areas we are doing in tip so

00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:01,540
here explaining how we can split the

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:04,540
functions between the different units

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:07,390
and also how we can split and make it

00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:09,880
open interface horizontally and

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,580
vertically there are some you know

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,850
alternative architecture choices here

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,490
you know type 1 and type 2 so depending

00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:21,070
on what your network overall strategy

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,710
and vendor partners you cannot have two

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:28,750
different alternatives different types

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:30,880
and we put together so it's not just a

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,330
paper technology or concept technology

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,650
we actually built our prototype in POC

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:42,910
and and successfully demonstrated and

00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:45,220
you know we have a very very important

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:53,050
technology companies in this in these

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:55,630
pictures such as already sees I think

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,580
yeah this is pretty much about it like I

00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:01,120
said I'd like to emphasize the

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:04,140
importance about what matters for the OP

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,120
mobile operators one is a TCO

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,520
innovations so with 5g

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,290
can you achieve that my answer is yes

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,910
because it

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,830
poverty architecture will be much more

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:21,100
simplified right so LTE and all the way

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:23,920
up to the you today's mobile network is

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,500
pretty complicated you know it was a

00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,070
streamline when we introduced the LTE

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,260
but still the complexity is there so we

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,200
have to further or significantly

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:38,340
streamline the mobile network you know

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:44,500
in five zero and we are working on it

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:47,320
collectively and secondly is new service

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:51,160
introductions should be agile

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:55,840
so we built a transform our service

00:22:51,160 --> 00:23:00,240
network service in structure become to

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,130
become agile programmable and reliable

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,310
so DevOps environment perfectly fit into

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,500
these strategies and last but not least

00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,050
is a end user who our customer

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,290
experience how we can set is by how you

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,970
can surprise how you can you know

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,010
impress your customer how so that you

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:22,120
can acquire new customer and also keep

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:24,250
retain your existing customers so we to

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,180
achieve all these three goals you know

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:33,280
5g network principle has to be designed

00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:36,490
properly to to embrace all this

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,660
technology innovations being happening

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:43,530
in in this community thank you thank you

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,530
for your attention

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:54,980
do we have questions or does everybody

00:23:50,300 --> 00:24:00,290
want to go home you're not going to be

00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:02,660
popular though as long as everybody gets

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,360
more knowledgeable I'm okay good answer

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:10,400
yeah you get a discount next year

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:13,100
sure okay Raghu from Siena when we

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:18,070
listen to the enterprise presentation

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:21,860
from Maria's some of the drivers

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:25,430
included the enormous number of changes

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,740
that they have to handle per day per

00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:31,960
month and the number of transactions

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:34,100
that they have to handle as a basis for

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,270
going down the Software Defined

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:41,980
Networking approach from a telco

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:45,710
operator mobile operator perspective

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:49,220
what is the scale of changes that you

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:52,130
have at this point in time that you

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,710
could not achieve and we would like to

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,780
achieve for example and the second

00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:02,030
aspect is when you are trying to think

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:05,240
of new service introduction what kind of

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:09,740
time scales do you anticipate needing as

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:13,190
you look into the future of the VRA our

00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:16,250
kind of services so how responsive

00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:21,410
should the network be going forward yeah

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:24,200
okay so my answer to your first question

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:28,430
scalability matters a lot to the

00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:31,780
operators for many reasons one the

00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:35,300
traffic demand is growing exponentially

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:40,190
you know average it data consumption per

00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:41,240
month per you know user last year you

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:45,170
know LTE

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,470
it's like two 2.5 or three gigabyte per

00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:51,650
month per users now this year one year

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:55,730
later it's already doubled and the

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:57,679
growth rate is increasing rapidly so you

00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,550
you have to make sure that your network

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,070
capacity

00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:04,700
and said capacity has to be scalable

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:08,960
right so scale scalability matters a lot

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:11,440
and to make your access networks as

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,780
scalable as possible we have to embrace

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,940
this kind of you know software ization

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,550
and clarification I mean you can

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,910
reproduce your precious radio resources

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:26,420
by densifying yourself site but like I

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:29,840
said it also associated many you know

00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:33,110
cost efficient cost and site management

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,810
cost so yeah so that's what you know

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,670
that's that's what matters

00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:40,940
things very difficult for the

00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:44,030
scalability to guarantee the scalability

00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:48,130
but anyway you know we we feel very

00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:50,720
confident that so far we we managed to

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:53,090
accommodate all this rapidly increasing

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,600
traffic demand mainly in the space of

00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:59,840
mobile media and from subscriber

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,550
perspective you may said you know in a

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,950
saturated market there is no

00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:07,100
subscription increase 'men which is not

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:09,830
true because IOT connected car there are

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,850
many things still needs new connectivity

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:16,520
so if you count them again the number of

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:20,200
subscribers will increase significantly

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:24,470
so these are our scalability commas and

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:28,760
to answer your next second question how

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:31,220
fast should we expect you in service

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,930
introduction I mean feel radically you

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,850
are ultimately it should be a real-time

00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:40,700
on demand and you know just like to

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,720
compete against that like what they are

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:48,230
providing the what OTT providing where

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:54,680
our speed has to be comparable so that's

00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:56,140
our target right very good thank you

00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,459
very much thank you thank you

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,459
