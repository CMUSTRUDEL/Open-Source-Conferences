thank you awesome all right last but not

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:12,000
the least so you've heard a lot of

00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:15,719
different opinions on enterprises on

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,270
cloud on carriers and one of the themes

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,630
of this conference is harmonizing open

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,769
source and what I want to do is walk you

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,320
through one example of how it gets done

00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:31,500
but show you the work we have in front

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,809
of us and at the Lenox foundation you

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,210
know we're very excited to sort of do

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,600
this work so let me just go very quickly

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:44,789
and talk about what I call the full

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,739
stack and this will be a teaser for

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,800
things to come but let me explain what

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,879
this slide talks about we're all we all

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,699
love layers right and we all love to

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,559
describe the pieces of network so here

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,989
you go you got the disaggregated

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,080
Hardware that gets abstracted in some

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,580
version with some standard whether it's

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
a you know from the hardware layer

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,869
you've got this I and the only

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,610
bootloader type interfaces goes up into

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,729
the operating system you have open

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,560
operating systems that run it and then

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,020
you start separating the control from

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,360
the data plane that we all call Sdn

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,880
the original Sdn you get into some

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,220
version of a cloud and then you get into

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,250
orchestration management policy and then

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,890
you start using it with analytics and

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,220
other sort of end-to-end systems and

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,720
then what really matters and this should

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,549
not be a surprise is the application

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,729
layer which is on the top the

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,090
application layer is really you know two

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:48,479
things for an enterprise it's their

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,210
workloads and for a carrier it's their

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,790
product and your services that you and I

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,270
and the businesses consume that's it

00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,630
it's not any more complicated than that

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:05,250
now what we have done is we have taken a

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,360
view of the entire ecosystem so you know

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,640
you're on the bottom you see you know

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,739
Linux Foundation and dotted is in the

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,170
outside Linux Foundation and what we

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,470
have done is we have put it all on a

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,200
Singh

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,220
slide that includes where some of the

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,710
standards are focusing on now keep in

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,950
mind it's a very busy slide but you can

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,110
it but trust me it was way busier six

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,350
months ago before oh now okay

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,900
so here you go so this slide essentially

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:38,370
shows you and I see a lot of cameras let

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,870
take a picture it's okay alright so what

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,640
it shows you is at the bottom you got

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,040
things like Open Compute telephone

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,280
infrastructure project these are open

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,970
source hardware they are working to help

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,610
us independently write software then you

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,120
have the data plane layer right OVS FD

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,850
io io wiser DP DK open data plane dark

00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,890
you have the operating systems you then

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,480
you have the control plane and then you

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,280
have orchestration and you see you know

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,550
own app kind of going vertically through

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,140
this OpenStack on that side you see the

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,620
cordon onus right there

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,530
open contrail and then you have OPI NFV

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,870
sort of in the middle where it's a CI CD

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,720
type end-to-end testing umbrella right

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,070
that's kind of on the what we know and

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,350
love right the hypervisor based

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,680
networking stack whatever the middle

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,870
part is cloud native right so as you

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,640
start getting into you know cloud NATO

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,410
cloud native apps you get the kubernetes

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,200
of the world you've got open containers

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,239
right so you know you have an option to

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,880
build a stack and automate the stack

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,709
using nothing but containers right and

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,220
and those are the open source projects

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,630
there on the ride is standards and if

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,630
you have heard a lot of discussion you

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,690
know all standards open source they need

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:58,200
and they will work together remember not

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,830
all the standards serve the entire stack

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,950
I Triple E 3gpp OIF they are right where

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,200
they are shown here right here Fayette

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,959
conf they're where they are shown tmn

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,380
forum itu nist i mean all of us

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:18,120
recognize this and our goal here is to

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,370
get a harmonized view of this so for

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,620
today what i want to do is show you how

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,960
it gets done and that's one of the

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,800
projects and that's own app which is a

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,050
combination of a company

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,270
we have talked about this a lot but what

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,479
I want to sort of bring out is behind

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,699
the scenes look at why it was done by

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,099
the way it's open to community as we

00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,460
announced yesterday so take a look at it

00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:44,800
download it I had a I had a user that

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,800
actually went in and said they could

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,860
download it and use it in in 15 minutes

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,319
and no help required and they actually

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,470
found one documentation bug so that's

00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:59,650
fixed now so take a look at it and so

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,530
I'm gonna welcome the first speaker you

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,740
know the the the largest carrier in the

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:08,740
world right and she owns the innovation

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,159
she owns that research and please

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,950
welcome deputy GM of China mobile

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:21,249
research madam yang

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:24,529
[Applause]

00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:26,149
thank you good morning ladies and

00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:28,669
gentlemen

00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:31,969
it's my pleasure to be here to witness

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:36,080
the kickoff of own app today

00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:38,539
and I'm very glad to have this

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,709
opportunity to share some of our views

00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:47,269
on the future and network the first of

00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:58,699
all please allow me introduce the China

00:05:47,269 --> 00:06:04,939
Mobile / flag by the end of last year we

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:09,019
have more than 503 meaning subscribers

00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:13,099
4G subscribers in our network and that's

00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:18,110
account for over 30 percent of global

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:22,309
artists users and we have constructed

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:25,129
more than 1.5 million for G sub base

00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:28,610
stations and for the beta user

00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:34,519
experience we have commercially launch

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:38,509
the the vo LTE in over 300 cities over

00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:41,719
the all of the China so today China

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:47,869
Mobile are running the world largest the

00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:51,499
4G network and the normal net is our

00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:53,599
vision of the future network there were

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:58,429
three goals you know future network

00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:01,819
there are new network architecture new

00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:08,509
network operation and new networker

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:12,349
service and I believe the enemy and stn

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:17,839
will be the enable technique technology

00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:24,289
with the future network let's look into

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:27,559
the new network architecture - - in

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:29,840
order to deal with the increasing huge

00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:33,169
state traffic and the

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,110
needs for the diverse services we are

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:38,930
considering two three architecture the

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:43,280
network to to make it more efficient

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:47,060
more intelligent and cost-saving

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:51,639
we are planning from three aspects the

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:54,320
first one is to clarify the

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,990
infrastructure that means the to

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,350
replacing the patent center offices with

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:05,270
new clarified datacenter which we call

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:08,990
them tix.com integrated cloud now second

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:13,550
one is separating control and the user

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:17,389
plains centralized the control unit in a

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:21,050
small small number of cortex and the

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:25,310
setup user plain network functions in

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:27,800
the architects which large numbers and

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:32,180
the located the closer to the access

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:35,450
point the second one is building up and

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:39,880
how for controller to achieve in titrant

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,880
routing and automatic configuration

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:47,810
nowadays we are building our trial

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,730
Network including for cities and some

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:55,600
new services and functions will be there

00:08:52,730 --> 00:09:03,110
will be tested in the first stages that

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:06,950
included the the EPC the MS and we the

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:13,580
brass and he bought that will be tested

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:17,300
in the first stages and as to the new

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:21,170
network operation and service we call

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,290
for a new OSS as we know the traditional

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,779
OSS can provide the fourth management

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,190
configuration management alerting

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:31,250
management and the performance

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:35,300
management but most of the OSS are

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,760
proprietary product from vendors or

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,040
system integrators so it's very

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,829
difficult to realize end to end the

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,600
measurement for the new network

00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:48,470
architect

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,350
we know the the talcum crowd the data

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:54,710
center are distributed in our network so

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:59,060
the for the new architecture for the new

00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:02,780
OSS some new capabilities should be

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,720
enhanced including the distributed

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:09,380
resource management the lifecycle

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,600
mentioned the 4 V and F and unified the

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,270
probability expulsion through the third

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,780
party application the most important

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:21,160
thing I think is to realize and to end

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,160
the surveys extraction and automatic

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,160
management

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:32,800
so as the the based on the above

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,340
consideration we launched the open o

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,740
open source

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,920
Austrade her project under linen

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:44,930
foundation together with our partner

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:48,650
last year in this damn one year the open

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:52,070
o has developed the 50 members and more

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:57,860
than 100 developers and the first

00:10:52,070 --> 00:11:02,570
release that was delivered in only five

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:06,080
months is after the lunch so I'm really

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:09,080
appreciate all the members of the open

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,230
all for their excellent work and the

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,290
based on the same idea today H and the

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,860
mobile and AT&T along with other

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:24,260
partners co-founded as a new project

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:30,200
owner thanks for the Linda Foundation's

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:33,590
active coordination and IB began we are

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:40,400
able to reach a Bingbing situation today

00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:43,880
and we believe that the new the the own

00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:47,420
app will have great influence on the

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,800
industry development and they I hope

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,710
that the new open source operator will

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,380
be

00:11:52,710 --> 00:12:01,380
industry irreverence implementation he

00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:09,360
knew that the infrastructure reference

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:15,090
of the new next generation of OSS and in

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:19,380
particular we are expecting some new the

00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:22,670
the expecting the own app will provide

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:27,020
some new key features including

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:30,450
automated onboarding for the vnf

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,970
automated the deployment for the network

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:37,020
service and among the automated

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,920
management for half cabs and for the

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:42,540
lifecycle management of B and F and

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:48,420
intelligent operation based on data

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:51,480
analysis so we are hoping that all

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,270
partners work together to build the

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,790
healthy ecosystem and accelerate as a

00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,150
matured health as the in and unlovely

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:03,270
and we are also expecting that onap can

00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:08,220
work very closely with other open source

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:11,430
projects and related stos to promote the

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,550
industry transformation as a whole and

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:18,390
we are waiting for more participates to

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:21,120
join this project and promote own app to

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:26,690
be a successful open source and

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,690
community thank you thank you very much

00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:39,410
and that's all for our site now please

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,850
welcome Chris wrath from AT&T welcome

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,040
[Music]

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:45,230
[Applause]

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,730
thank you madam yang

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,410
okay so madam yang did a really great

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,389
job talking about kind of what we've

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,730
done I want to spend a little bit of

00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,919
time touching on that but really more of

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,629
kind of how you know I think I want to

00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,040
think of this as a framework for how to

00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,869
get involved especially service

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,319
providers to get involved but really to

00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:06,299
the broader community and so I bring

00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:08,730
this up because 18t joined Linux

00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:11,459
Foundation is a Platinum Member excuse

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,999
me in February of this year but I want

00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:18,179
to do this as a compare and contrast so

00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:20,910
about ten years ago I was working on a

00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:24,029
project not an exact same position I'm

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,839
in now and I wanted to use some open

00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,189
source and they said well you know

00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,129
you're not allowed to use open source in

00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:31,709
18 t it's actually against policy to use

00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:33,480
open source and so just to give you an

00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,039
idea how far we've come not only we a

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,529
Platinum Member in the Linux Foundation

00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,209
but today about when we break it up

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,039
different ways but about 40 percent of

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:46,109
the software that we use inside ATT is

00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:47,569
built on open source I want to talk

00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:50,279
about how we went through our

00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:52,799
transformation how did we decide what we

00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,669
needed to do in the top two areas there

00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,739
on this chart

00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:57,720
probably everyone here who would be

00:14:55,739 --> 00:15:00,179
giving a presentation could put those up

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,699
there customer enablement speed and

00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,649
flexibility right improved efficiency

00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,209
operations those are motherhood and

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,999
apple pie everybody would agree with

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:11,309
those but how do you get to those what

00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:13,589
technologies do you use what platforms

00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,549
what structures needed to do it so I'm

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,350
going to start at the bottom because

00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,600
that's really the reason it's there it's

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,129
the foundation it's for us it's the

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,929
skills it's the people it's a

00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:24,089
capabilities transformation that we

00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:26,309
needed to go through people process and

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,529
culture and that's been fundamental at

00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:31,799
AT&T I'm going to talk a little bit more

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:34,619
about that then it's built on a common

00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,929
network cloud a network cloud that's

00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:39,419
different than a standard cloud has to

00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:41,369
handle Network workloads and then the

00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:43,410
fundamental kind of story line that runs

00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:45,899
through those three pillars

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,930
is think of that as applications and

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,600
services built on a common network

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:54,660
operating system that are under software

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,470
control and so thanks to a lot of great

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,639
work by people in this audience and

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,290
others you know the virtualization

00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,420
there's been a tremendous amount of work

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,810
there until who was up here earlier you

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,449
know in the past 10 years their standard

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,579
processors have improved about a hundred

00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:13,399
x in their ability to process packets

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:16,079
getting to the point a tipping point

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,910
disruptive innovation where we can start

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,439
thinking of those as service providers

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,410
is doing workloads that we need to do

00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:24,569
merchants silicon Andre foo which my

00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,949
boss who was up here earlier giving off

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,970
the kick off talked about some of the

00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:28,709
work we're doing there you're seeing

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,240
that merchants Silicon taking over only

00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:31,560
proprietary silicon used to be able to

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,079
do that another tipping point and

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,870
disruptive innovation Software Defined

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,360
Networking probably don't need a preach

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,670
to the choir here a great amount of work

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,139
done there a lot of capabilities that we

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,089
can leverage but really whether it was a

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,339
missing ingredient for us was that thing

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,290
in the middle madam yang talked about it

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,720
which was really that network operating

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,850
system for Sdn automation that would

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,449
really do the complete lifecycle

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,709
associated with that I'm gonna talk a

00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:57,899
little bit more about that and clearly

00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,899
we have a project about it as well but I

00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,490
wrote a blog I don't know maybe it was a

00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:04,020
six months ago around kind of the

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,459
tenants of open source at least as far

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,179
as we were concerned and that was like

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,679
code community and commitment and I want

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,970
to kind of reference those back here I'm

00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,380
going to change the order because the

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,539
more I thought about it it's really

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,039
about a commitment and then code and

00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,380
then community so I actually have it in

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,809
that order now and so this was our

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,459
commitment our commitment is AT&T was

00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,500
that we were going to rescale our

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,839
workforce we were going to do that under

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,539
a new social contract and we were going

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,130
to take and evolve that intelligent and

00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:34,530
great people that we had and give them

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,419
skills of the future and so what did we

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:40,530
do well John Donovan again who was up

00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:43,080
here earlier talked about how we're

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,080
moving our workforce in a direction

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,820
that's really the future of the way that

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,960
networks will be built going forward

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,760
about 45% of the folks that John has and

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,220
John has about half the people at AT&T a

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,000
TTS around 270,000 people so that's a

00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,419
lot of people

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,010
around half those folks have pivoted

00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:04,590
this is more broad now actually with an

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,780
AT&T it's actually done throughout all

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,950
of 18 T John's organization then kind of

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,630
pushed it down to the rest of 18 T about

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,909
50% or so the people who go through this

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,260
rescaling are likely to get hired that's

00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:17,490
actually very good because they're

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,240
significantly more than two people

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,320
applying for a job at AT&T and about

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,860
1,250 people have been through this and

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,250
have been put into a new skill or new a

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,200
job or promoted and so what were the

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,760
tools that we put in place right this is

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,840
a great ask of people but you got to

00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,760
make sure you give them the right tools

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,429
to be able to do it we put things in

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,380
like skill coaches we changed our hiring

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,970
process to make sure we flag folks who

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,789
have gone through this there's a

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,020
learning portal that talks about your

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,270
progress where you need what you need to

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,710
go kind of the skills you have the job

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,860
you want what skills do you need to

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,450
acquire we had apprenticeships

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,500
interestingly we kind of learned

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,909
something that quite frankly the

00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,650
academics have known for a long time

00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:59,909
because we would go out to our people

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,440
who were skilled in these areas and we

00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,000
say well what would people need to do

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,799
this is the data science people would

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,510
load it up with data science courses in

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,159
the network people would load it up with

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,230
networking course isn't really what you

00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,549
realize there's a core curriculum that

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,350
everybody really needs and then there's

00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:18,030
specialization and that's the way we

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:21,150
ended up and so then there's code right

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:23,280
and we talked about this we released

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,500
open source ecomp into the Linux

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,090
Foundation we merged with the great

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,530
folks and China Mobile and others who

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,080
were part of open oh we created

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,120
something called own app and why are we

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,600
doing this well quite frankly all of the

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,299
service providers are very very good at

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,980
managing complexity we're probably not

00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:44,309
as good as we should be at avoiding it

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,020
and really what we mean by that is it we

00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,690
want to be able to start building

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,190
services and applications faster but if

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,559
you look for the people who do that and

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,600
do that well they've actually spent a

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,490
good amount of time building a platform

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,080
that allows them to do that it's not

00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,850
like they start from scratch every time

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,440
and so to increase the pace of

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,970
innovation you need some kind of common

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,919
network operating system use some kind

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,830
of platform you want to make sure that

00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,059
all the functions you need are built in

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,910
orchestration is essentially the ante to

00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,560
be in the game

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,570
it doesn't mean you were dealt a great

00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,980
hand really to be have a great hand you

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,330
got to make sure that you have the

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,920
ability to do metrics you have the

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,960
ability to do policy so you got to bake

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,580
some of those things in easy service

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,380
provisioning be able to manage it

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,090
ideally you would like to be able to

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,890
scale it automatically so you'd like to

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,810
be able to do control loops and closed

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,720
loops and machine learning to make that

00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:34,030
happen and really importantly is you

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,540
want to get rid of the kind of rack and

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:39,940
stack rip and replace forklift take your

00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,470
favorite name there that we have to go

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,880
through every time we upgrade the

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:48,040
equipment and be able to do it through

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:50,140
software in the community the outreach

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,410
to the community so own app has been in

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,970
existence for about 50 days since it was

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,570
announced just before Mobile World

00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:01,360
Congress the service providers that we

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:05,230
have represented they're on the right

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,640
side of the graph represent about 38% of

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:12,520
the worldwide mobile subscribers you can

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,930
see the vendors that we have on the

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,850
other side as well I think you'll

00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,640
recognize a lot of those names I this is

00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:21,370
clearly an a-team we're very excited to

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,640
have these set of folks doing this

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:26,590
a total of 27 members in 50 days and I

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,190
think it was five that were announced

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:32,170
this week and then there's 34 percent

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,240
additional wireless subscribers let me

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,920
call them in the pipeline and what do I

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,560
mean by in the pipeline is that means

00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,480
that we've had one or more conversations

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,090
with those folks about coming on board

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,590
and being a part of this and I'm gonna

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,810
say something that might shock the

00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,430
audience here that there are times when

00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,770
the service provider community can be

00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:54,280
what I'll call thrifty and methodical

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,540
and what I'm really doing is when I talk

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,310
today I want to reach out to that

00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:01,200
community and I want to say that look

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:04,330
don't be a spectator be a participant

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,640
jump in there folks that can help you on

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,810
this journey and we're glad to do that

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,200
so I want to thank you all for the time

00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,200
