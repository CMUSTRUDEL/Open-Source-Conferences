	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,700
good morning you've heard dr. yíall and

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,910
the Margaret talked about two different

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,349
perspectives how to work with open

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,090
source and you know what kind of

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,969
commercial things you can do with open

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,440
source but I actually want you to point

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,900
I want to find a slightly different

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,880
perspective you actually written as two

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,640
biggest networking vendors commit to

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,230
open source so that's I think you know

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,390
who says networking is not transforming

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,590
right what I'm going to walk you through

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,469
is Verizon's you know perspective on

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,719
open source why will like open source

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,059
why we want to work with it but before

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,520
going there kind of give you a little

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,090
bit of context on where we stand and

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:50,280
what is driving some of this if you look

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:53,160
at our traffic patterns across wireline

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,050
Wireless global IP networks they're

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,530
going up I mean this is a story that

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,510
you'll hear from any carrier you know

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,260
they're going up at 40 50 percent a year

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,960
in a year or a year and this does not

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,659
account for what is you know a whiting

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,820
right things like a are we are AI now

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,860
when when those things start becoming

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,500
mainstream we expect these to actually

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,720
accelerate the growth at the same time

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,810
when you look at the industry industry

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,960
is you know evolving we are seeing

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,159
competition come from different areas

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,100
even in the networking side now you're

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,770
hearing a lot about you know high

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,560
altitude platforms whether it is SpaceX

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,409
and not somebody else or are you looking

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,930
at web scale carriers deploying massive

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,630
amount of fiber across the globe so you

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,430
know there's different kinds of

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,799
computation emerging a number of

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,500
networks that each carrier is managing

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,619
is increasing not only that we have we

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,030
still have one x 2g EVDO on others but

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,070
we are you know deploying phi g and we

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,469
are working on even on the fire side

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,869
multiple flavors so as the variability

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,270
of the network increases there is a bit

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,369
of complexity and finally the

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,460
transformation complexity you know this

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:15,910
entire forum is about Sdn and Fe and

00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:19,240
carriers you know haven't already called

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,040
reached the point where this becomes a

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,040
be a you think we are still exploring

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,390
figuring out what is the right way

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,610
between us and the vendors and the

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,800
open-source bodies and others there's a

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:34,660
lot of work to be done to make this you

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,600
know seamless same time when we look

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,220
ahead there is there are new pressures

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,380
that are going to come across at us

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,480
right the the physical traditional

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,310
integration

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,030
Sandra talked about another starter word

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:52,390
so when you live in a world of augmented

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:55,090
reality and autonomous vehicles networks

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,380
can't just you know be managed by just

00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,640
wearing bandwidth that's sort of been

00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,920
doing and we were selling minutes of

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,080
usage and then we went to you know

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,840
gigabits and and megabits of bandwidth

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,870
we had to start looking at other levers

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,900
to deliver those experiences latency is

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,560
definitely one of them master own of

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,650
connectivity so networks will have to be

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,560
you know develop to start providing

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,270
those sort of experiences in slices and

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,690
that increases I want a complexity that

00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,820
you know within the within the network

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:32,500
systems the other point I want to point

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:35,770
out is if you look at traffic between

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,870
wild line and Wireless 80% of the IP

00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,520
traffic that goes on the carrier

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:44,860
networks and I'm gonna talk a bit about

00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:47,370
us here comes from five publishers it

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,740
might differ for example on wireline

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,630
will see Netflix being one of the

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,450
biggest driver of the traffic if you go

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,300
into the wireless it's YouTube but

00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,970
effectively 80% of for the traffic is

00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,000
going to five publishers what does this

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:07,090
mean what this means is we're no longer

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,850
a not south traffic management you know

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,680
company or organizations we are also

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,570
dealing with a lot of east-west traffic

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,120
management because we have peering

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,340
partnerships with these companies most

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,880
of the traffic is you know finding the

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,060
the quickest way to exit our networks

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,400
and enter these publishers network so

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,169
it's a

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,790
paradigm a different way of building

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,430
networks and then the way we've been

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:34,220
you're building networks in the past the

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,139
third point that you know that we look

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,199
at is that we've built networks to have

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,210
this monolithic centralized control but

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,419
the use cases are gonna emerge down the

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,460
road will require networks to be you

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,630
know ad hoc dynamic you know you may

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,990
want to create networks at the edge and

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,300
and terminate them and at an instant's

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,190
you know notice you will require a very

00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,380
different kind of control system to

00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:02,690
manage this dispersed you know ecosystem

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,840
and Darla's that is again driving

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,120
networks to look at look at you know

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,880
what sort of future paradigms we could

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,650
air up to and finally there is a there's

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,479
a lot of talk about distributed clouds

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,010
this is what is going to be the future

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,680
of networks its virtualized and we are

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,199
able to run any application anywhere in

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,419
the network all the way to the light

00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,310
pole having a computing storage running

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:30,860
any kind of packet core application of

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,430
any application you call it to the the

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:38,150
centralized data you know there are very

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,870
houses there are centers and networks

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:44,090
are I mean software driven they are

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,460
adopting what IT teams have gone through

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,710
DevOps and cloud and whatever else but

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,250
this also kind of illustrates the point

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:54,610
I was making before is that it's about

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,780
moving the traffic east-west it's it's

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,949
we're going to operate similar to like

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,039
the way where the web scale and other

00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:03,139
other companies have figured out and do

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,690
it you know very optimal sense networks

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,659
will have to kind of get there

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:11,810
so why open-source promise of scale and

00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:14,900
resiliency and what what it so when we

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,360
look at the the pioneers in this area

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,639
who have developed white box solutions

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,539
and who figured out how to move traffic

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,979
between data centers we start seeing

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,199
that you know the networks are going to

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,760
be in this manner we are going to have

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,900
large number of data centers we'll have

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:35,060
to start moving traffic we see how the

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,669
open-source principles were you know

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,840
implemented by some of these web-scale

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,790
providers we

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,699
see the same things can apply and we can

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:47,030
leverage some of those learning the

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:51,250
second key point is you know telco

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:54,710
carriers typically followed standards

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,110
but standards bodies tend to be slow it

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,669
takes time so what is happening now is

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,680
that being part of the open-source

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,440
communities we're able to get

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,870
like-minded people together you know

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,090
talk about things that make sense

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,460
quickly put that into core and then take

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,710
a deployment the timescale difference

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,630
between what you can do through a

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,030
standards body versus what he can do

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,160
through a an open-source community is is

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,780
in a hugely different and so this

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,780
becomes an extremely extremely

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:28,790
attractive the the the other key point

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:31,789
is we see that in open communities are

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:37,220
companies that have implemented open

00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:39,740
source based solutions automation others

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,210
almost come in both internally because

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,610
there was the you know there is an

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,979
actual development by the developers and

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,930
others but there's a lot of community

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,930
contribution towards problems you know

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,960
solving the problems that is in again a

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,580
track to him in today when we deploy

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,510
networks in our plans based networks and

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,979
rely on one or two vendors or a problem

00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,050
to a solution typically has to come from

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:07,090
that one or two vendors and and it takes

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:09,289
time any kind of automation any kind of

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,289
optimization others we still relying on

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:15,260
those vendors in this paradigm I think

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,910
we see the community behind us and the

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,820
community can actually help innovate

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:22,070
faster and finally dollars I mean

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,669
there's definitely an open source the

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:28,250
cost structures are are different than

00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:32,900
then you know what what we're used to so

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:36,800
it's it's an interesting thing so why

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,529
are we not jumping in at full speed this

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,209
the slide kind of you know reflects

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:44,029
internal dynamics and we go through

00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,440
right there are multiple groups in fact

00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:49,010
we are going through these conversations

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,660
now about osm own app who's behind it

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,950
remember we talked about that these are

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,780
becoming soo

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,210
standards group groups right so if you

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,070
can get more people into one group then

00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,190
you can actually influence the ecosystem

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,020
and drive changes faster but which

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,760
ecosystem so we're going through all

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:12,380
these conversations what what we need is

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:15,350
we need to see more deployments we also

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,690
need to see more contribution from wide

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:21,050
variety of sources we've had examples

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,970
where companies come and says I've got

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,950
this tool or I've got the software and

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,260
it's open source and look who's

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,730
developing it is like one company

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,430
developing you know there's no no

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,950
contributor than that we seeing a lot of

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,030
that confusion and and regarded we got

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:42,440
to work work beyond that

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:44,030
finally there's also disaggregation as

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,400
the topic has been talked quite a bit in

00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,290
the last one and a half two days open

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,180
source is driven by desire aggression

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,790
where each one of us can innovate in

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,810
specific areas but what the striving is

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,520
that we need to do a lot more

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:59,420
integration than what we had done in the

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:04,190
past what they asked for vendors in our

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,630
suppliers is what we see today is is you

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,000
know the lowest level is OpenStack

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,880
packaged around some other proprietary

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,080
functionality and given to us and when I

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,850
try to integrate that with somebody

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,070
else's functionality it gets extremely

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,800
complicated what we want are what we

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,770
what we are asked for vendor community

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,870
is you can innovate on your own

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,970
applications and others but make sure

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,130
that the integration becomes open you

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,520
follow the standard or you follow the

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,190
community you know communities and and

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,070
an open models and others so that you

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,740
know we can integrate much faster across

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,870
vendors across different open source

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,360
projects and others and that needs to be

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,580
the one that needs to be solved

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,560
finally our ask is harmonize the groups

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,260
that are not a lot of open source groups

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,870
doing a lot of different things I don't

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,330
think we're recommending that you know

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,190
it needs to be one open source group or

00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,360
a project but I think we need to have

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,280
more dialogue between the teams

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,260
especially if you're all abstracting

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,770
things quite a bit then there has to be

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,450
some level of

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,390
you know integration level conversation

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,670
that need to happen we need to move

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,890
towards the pliable solution at the

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,110
lower levels we are seeing OpenStack and

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:19,170
others carriers are deploying into the

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,300
field and we can see scale we can see

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,070
you know massive volumes of data going

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,420
through them but as we slowly start

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:32,820
moving upwards we haven't seen deployed

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:35,860
solutions any any questions I know I

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:41,619
have a minute

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,619
