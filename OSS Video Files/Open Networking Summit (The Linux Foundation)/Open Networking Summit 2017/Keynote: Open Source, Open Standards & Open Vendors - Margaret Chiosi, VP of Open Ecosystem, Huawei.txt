anyhow I'm gonna practice my Chinese I'm

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,300
really excited to be back in the

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,759
industry representing Huawei hallway has

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,230
actually been very gracious that Network

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,940
for you and gracious and warm and

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,529
welcoming into their business unit as

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,900
well as into their homes

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,109
my role in Huawei is actually to help

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,400
continue the journey with Huawei in

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:27,539
advancing us the identity principles

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,039
creating new business value and so forth

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,529
and actually to contribute back into the

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,530
community the goal of course is to help

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,770
us accelerate creating new services in

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,879
the industry as well as putting it in a

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,070
cost-efficient manner

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,780
I want to thank actually my partner in

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,340
China bill Ren and his colleague Ben

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:54,899
yang and actually helping to create this

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:56,100
talk so where are we today as you can

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,980
tell in this graph that everyone's

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,780
familiar with is we're actually at the

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,180
open network ecosystems X Y at the

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,939
height of exuberance unfortunately the

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,850
business challenges our revenues and so

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,520
forth are not quite there yet the yueqin

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,590
system doesn't mature and the business

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,100
models models have not caught up to this

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,520
exuberant level we're still at the chasm

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,830
before the chasm and trying to create

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,600
rapid revenue growth the estern control

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,280
arena has everyone's familiar with is

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,180
actually pretty much productized

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,950
products are being rolled out and

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,079
hopefully we're now in a product life

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,320
cycle where we can actually now get into

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,810
the increasing of revenue growth but our

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,350
real challenges is a healthy community a

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,720
healthy community where users and

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:49,320
carriers and vendors actually

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,180
participate well together three areas

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,610
what's the role of community the

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,610
community to basically work a common

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,229
framework the users bringing in real use

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,630
cases that are going to go into

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,509
production and vendors creating

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,119
high-quality products and end-to-end

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,380
solutions so I like to take each one of

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,380
these on their own

00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,330
so what's the community role so as a lot

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,070
of people know I actually was part of

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,580
the inception of La the SDN entity

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,200
principles here and I am really amazed

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,530
at how far we have come

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,480
the few of us think about just a handful

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,010
of us started this actually we were in

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,780
the orange offices in San Francisco

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,480
whatever number of years ago I've lost

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,570
track just trying to figure out how do

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,040
we get the industry focus on nfe and so

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,820
that's where we created the inception of

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,390
Etsy I see nfe and it's just amazing

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:51,450
based on the long nights the the

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,340
constant discussions our fights and the

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,540
actual changing exchanging of ideas

00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,250
rearranging ideas rearranging

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,740
architectures to basically get to where

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,810
we are today and a lot of the things

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,390
that you've seen getting deployed a lot

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,430
of the open source organizations didn't

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,650
create it or actually a lot of the ideas

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,920
started I think from the NCIC nfe

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,080
organization we started so we've done a

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,690
lot we've accomplished a lot but we

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,570
still have a lot of challenges today we

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,600
still have too many similar projects in

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,640
different domains we didn't have a

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,050
single common intend frame work with

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,300
closely control last year but in 2017 as

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,520
you can tell things have changed I think

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,680
we've learned a lot through the

00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,090
different participations we might have

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,010
taken a little bit longer than what we

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,130
should have before released we're

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,780
learning OPN Fe is basically has a role

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,990
now that's becoming more of an

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,420
integrator CI CD type of environment

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,850
open o and O and open ecomp

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,040
have merged into own app so now we have

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,490
an antenna framework with closed loop

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,400
control and actually we also now have DB

00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,280
TK you know DP converging and that again

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,320
is another example of just a few of us I

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,990
mean it's like maybe three of us

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,370
starting this where we got OTP and DB

00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,350
decay to converge and work with each

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,010
other and so now we have Banky from

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:19,049
Intel and Bob Monkman from arm actually

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,730
working together which that a few of us

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,430
would know that was a great feat right

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,500
there so we look forward to actually

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,210
as we we start implementing more and

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,250
more of these different open-source

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,139
pieces and components we're looking

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,400
forward to more consolidation because I

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,020
think it's obvious there's certain areas

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,229
that need to consolidate more and of

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,669
course we're always actually gonna be

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,110
collaborating and working with the

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:46,289
industry and helping us get more

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:49,080
efficient so what's the operators role

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:51,810
so the operators role is to bring real

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,360
use cases to the community that they are

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,449
going to put in production it is

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,389
critical that we go beyond slide where

00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,130
be on live trials into production we

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,190
need to focus on intense solutions

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,349
versus just technology which solve real

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,380
business needs creating new services and

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:11,940
obviously providing new revenues we need

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,070
to do it much more quickly than what's

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,900
happening today we need to go from field

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,479
trial to production much more quickly

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,849
the faster we move into production I

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,919
personally use that the faster the open

00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:25,080
source consortiums will be more

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,900
effective and useful and I believe

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,720
faster innovation so gurus talked

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,229
yesterday or yesterday Monday was

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,080
actually very telling basically he said

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:39,570
there was a basic there was an a major

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,000
resource gap and a misalignment of

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,240
incentives which is slowing our progress

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,599
in the end sort of quoting Sandra

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,199
Rivera's comment from yesterday show me

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,570
the money

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,080
that's basically where we're at we need

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,669
to bring in value to our businesses

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,009
where their work errors or where there

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,750
were vendors that actually bring in

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,820
revenues to actually support this

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:08,220
ecosystem so that's probably the

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:10,650
critical message I think for 2017 what's

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,009
the vendors role to deliver high quality

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,870
products and intense solutions so in

00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:17,550
Huawei we actually been building our

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,220
outdoor controller the Souris ting

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,960
controller based on the best and breed

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,490
of open source pieces from onus and odl

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,690
we have actually built a lot of our

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,430
different controllers our domain

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,700
controllers using the term that I guess

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,380
like I created a while ago based on

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,750
different areas so the domain

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,530
controllers that we have cover things

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:46,080
from data centers doing cloud fabric

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:52,440
we've spine edge sites as well as access

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:55,110
as well as Metro when and so forth so

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,780
our goal is to actually continue

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,930
evolving these products and to hopefully

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:04,470
in within three years deploy or sell

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:08,310
about a thousand controllers so we're

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:11,250
building products today we have a case

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:15,560
study that actually in in China Unicom

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:18,480
where we provided a layer 3 VPN

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,540
on-demand interconnect between China

00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Unicom status centers this is based on a

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,460
VPN application providing a model driven

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,590
configurator which configured the two

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,380
controllers to vendors controllers the

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,810
wall way at the controller an MPLS

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,790
controller and the another vendors MPLS

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,740
controller so now our only was this

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,900
application configuring both through him

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,190
a common model but also these

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,130
controllers are backing up each other

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:47,700
they were not they were not just

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:50,970
managing their own multi MPLS routers

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,770
they were actually managing both of the

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:59,669
routers and so of course then they

00:07:52,770 --> 00:08:02,580
backed up each other so finally I like

00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:04,260
to say I hope this talk helps you feel

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,460
good about what we've accomplished

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,740
because I think we've accomplished a lot

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,350
we have much more to accomplish going

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,630
forward so I encourage you to go out

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,740
there stay engaged

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,860
don't just observe be active in the

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,470
communities and participate and figure

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,169
out how to bring business value to your

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,810
company as well whether you're a carrier

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,669
or whether you're a vendor because in

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,860
the end I think once you figure that out

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,719
you will participate more actively and

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,080
make sure the open-source communities

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:43,889
are useful in effective Shesha
