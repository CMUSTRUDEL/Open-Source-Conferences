well good morning everybody my name is

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,649
Roz Roseboro I am a senior analyst at

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,360
heavy reading covering the data center

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,450
in mono and has spent a lot of time

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,960
looking at open source open source

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,699
projects and just to kick things off I'm

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,609
sure many of you have heard over the

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,210
past few days that 5g is going to be a

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,300
big deal

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,880
apparently and so I'm very happy to have

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,619
a group of people here who are going to

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,170
be very instrumental in actually making

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,910
Feige a reality so I'd like to do to

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,820
start off with is have each one of you

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,660
introduce yourselves and tell us why are

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,870
you excited about 5g okay my name is

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,180
Martin Backstrom I joined Ericsson four

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,489
years ago to overlook the the cloud and

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,570
virtualization strategies after been

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,860
working out selling VPNs and virtual

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,350
machines and other things for the

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,260
enterprise sector from an operator I'm

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,780
very excited on the opportunity of 5g

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,750
because 5g represents a chance for

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,299
growth in our industry of course 5g is

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,890
mobile broadband but beyond that it's

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,960
also an integration to other industries

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,030
and I think it's the real opportunity

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:17,369
for operators to grow their top line so

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,369
my name is drew shulkie vice president

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,080
of networking at Delhi and C I'm excited

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,880
about 5g because what I think it's going

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,700
to do is actually unleash a new era of

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,259
computing maybe contrary to some you

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,790
know current conventional wisdom that

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,829
all computing is going to collapse into

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,470
a couple of centralized mega clouds

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,799
I think 5g is gonna unleash this era of

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,150
massive massively distributed to compute

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,619
and I think it's good news for a great

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,600
many people in this audience because

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,189
when that becomes a reality it's gonna

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,229
open up you know similar what martin

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,850
said a lot of economic opportunities at

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,970
the edge for additional services for

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,590
folks in this room make a lot of money

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,390
good morning I'm John Healy I'm

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,659
responsible for Network solutions within

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,369
Intel and 5g for me I think is as much a

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,680
personal excitement as it is an industry

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,390
excitement I despite my youthful looks

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,189
I've been in networking for a long time

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,869
I was involved in the build-out of the

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,310
first some of the first digital wireless

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,869
network society later networks in Europe

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,540
you know years and years ago and all of

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,680
those were evolutions of technology what

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,959
in 5g brings it

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,180
revolution to the technology it's truly

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,120
going to change the industry from a

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,549
vendor relationship and Martin said

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,810
participation from new new entities but

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,150
it's also going to change people's lives

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,730
fundamentally the depth and breadth of

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,980
of applications and experiences that can

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,810
be enabled by 5g is what makes it really

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,099
exciting from a personal perspective I

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,889
feel it's like the culmination of my

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,569
career on business perspective I think

00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:41,420
truly it represents a whole lot of new

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,560
opportunity for industries that

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,569
participated before together but didn't

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,700
naturally collaborate in parkour as much

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,939
and 5g will create the fabric to allow

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,349
that to happen ok great so first off

00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,519
let's talk about what do you think of

00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:55,379
the most significant technical

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,510
challenges that we're going to face with

00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,590
5g obviously were talking about like you

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,060
said it's going to be on the enterprise

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,069
side the service providers side and the

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,900
ran in the core you know where do you

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,730
think the biggest challenges are and you

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,319
know how confident are you that the

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,459
industry would be able to overcome those

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,569
challenges I know it's still pretty

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:15,120
early all right I'll start I think there

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,849
you know like every change in technology

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,079
there are a lot of challenge there's a

00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:20,419
higher degree of complexity in the

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,590
network now if you think about

00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:25,019
virtualization and the need for more

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,120
agile placement of resources and

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,530
management of service there's also a lot

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,689
of challenge around maintaining some of

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,609
the expected tight tolerances you know

00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,199
ultra-low bandwidth and or ultra low

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,599
latency and high bandwidth provisioning

00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,180
to mass numbers of devices all that

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,019
comes with a whole new set of

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,079
interoperability challenges and

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,849
implementation challenges that are there

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,769
they're different because it they want

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,989
to be implemented in a multi vendor

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,000
environment so it's it requires

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,040
partnering it requires standardization

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,489
it also requires a speed of innovation

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,959
across the market so not they're not

00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,370
insurmountable but they're not

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,859
insignificant either so I think there

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,720
are but events like this one bring

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,400
together the right mind share desire to

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,250
address how can we collaboratively

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,900
resolve some of those those issues then

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,280
from a kind of a level of confidence in

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,419
the market I'm very confident the

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,180
industry will make this happen I think

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:18,060
that the the prospect of return for a

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,970
much broader ecosystem of vendors it's

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,650
so so profound that it's causing the

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,750
collaboration to happen in ways we might

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,180
not have seen before and I'm very

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,040
confident that the inter the the

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,960
the efforts around the communities that

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,880
are following us are forming to solve

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,340
for 5g at the various levels of the

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,320
solution stack are also enabling a

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,449
broader participation at the innovation

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,810
and test and implementation level which

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:46,979
I think will help to speed it along what

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,350
do you think I might go so far as to say

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,240
I don't know if there's any technical

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,600
challenges that come to mind I think to

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,250
me what really jumps out is for 5g to be

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,930
successful the current efforts that we

00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,430
have going in terms of disaggregating

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,380
the stack and decoupling function and

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,479
location are an absolute prerequisite

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,550
and to me

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,229
much of what we need to do to make 5g

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,060
successful is going to become apparent

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,220
as we get more of this current model

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,360
deployed and into production we don't

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,070
know what we don't know yet

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,539
and so there's probably some technical

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,669
elements that because we don't have

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,740
necessarily the widespread adoption yet

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,139
making very good progress and we're

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,460
certainly very happy with that I think

00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,320
the biggest technical challenge is we

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:32,580
haven't seen yet I think automation is

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,740
really key we have sort of reinvented

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,800
technologies so we can take care of much

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,229
bigger mobile broadband usage today than

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,409
just a couple of years ago basically

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,909
with the same capex as before but we if

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,430
you're looking on OPEX and the

00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:50,220
efficiency of our industry we are very

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,199
much where we were 10 years ago and what

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,409
we do today mobile broadband will just

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,760
be one portion of what we do so

00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:58,919
automation on what we do today and a

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,389
much higher productivity also in

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,240
handling our networks rolling out

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:06,510
commissioning them is absolutely key to

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,099
also have the capabilities to do the

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,220
network's license and integration with

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:12,930
other industry which is key to growth ok

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,760
that's actually gonna lead me to one of

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,440
my other questions is about how do you

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,970
think the relationship between service

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,979
providers and the enterprise is going to

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,849
change I think let's me was talking a

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,800
little bit about that in her

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:24,510
presentation because there has been some

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,520
discussion that perhaps the enterprise's

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,320
will be rolling out their own private

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,250
IOT networks I mean do you think that's

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,440
going to happen do you think that's

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,760
going to change the relationship or the

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,330
balance of power between those two

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,190
entities don't you start sure yeah I

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,590
think that it so there are a couple of

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,980
levels to it I think it provides for a

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,120
new

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,240
set of partnerships and relationships

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,340
that have might not have existed before

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,780
where services tailored toward the

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,550
requirements of the business of the

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,960
enterprise can be created and then a

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,700
partnering and how they're deployed and

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,020
how they're implemented and that's

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,240
certainly from a business perspective

00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,910
there's an opportunity but it also

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,100
starts to put more assets in the hands

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,290
of the enterprise to create business

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,430
opportunities for themselves that might

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,480
not have been as as flexibly accessible

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,130
in the past a lot of what I actually

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,930
spoke about another is spoken about this

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,000
week is you know the the level and

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,560
degree of internal development work

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,050
they're prepared to do and wants to do

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,050
for their business so as I as a path

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,550
toward the implementation of 5g and that

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,260
infrastructure it creates an opportunity

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,700
for parking at the innovation and

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,340
development end as well

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,690
in tailoring how those new types of

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,510
applications and services can be brought

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:36,120
to market yeah I think it unleashes a

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,250
whole new realm of you know to the

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,730
previous point of of opportunities to

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,620
cooperate I have to believe that with

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,870
the with the launch of 5g the need to do

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,390
more and more things at the edge is

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,830
going to be critical and in enterprises

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,720
and let's just we just had target up

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,460
here previously I have to imagine that

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,320
as they tap into some of the

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,210
capabilities be it augmented reality or

00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,770
things like that increase the

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,380
attractiveness of their business that

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,390
there's going to be a need to do more

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,950
things at the edge which to do on their

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,880
own globally would be very very

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,170
challenging which means you're gonna be

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,060
partnering as with carriers to go make

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,450
it a reality that's sort of one aspect

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,890
of it the other thing I come back to is

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,690
you know analytics and machine learning

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,040
or driving so much of what we have doing

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,130
going on today I don't see that changing

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,960
anytime in the future with 5g and they

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,660
need to do real-time analytics again

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,790
back at the edge partnering with the

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,320
carriers I think would make a ton of

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,330
sense for a lot of enterprises if they

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,560
have businesses that are you know very

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:40,590
much dependent upon that real-time

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:43,710
feedback yeah the the IOT market this is

00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,900
sort of an emerging market opportunity

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,690
and we can see some ID so building sort

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,750
of network by themselves by some players

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,950
in the market by some enterprises I

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,140
however believe that the

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,690
mission-critical type of IOT

00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,700
like burglar Lorenson on anything like

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,550
that will be the important factor there

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,820
and then to run anything on unlicensed

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,190
spectrum without supervision or anything

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,810
it's not the long-term solution so I

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,850
think the operator stand a very good

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,700
chance to capture also the low-power

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,940
wide area network we then be IOT and

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,340
similar technologies and that most of

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,490
the enterprises will actually go to

00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:26,670
operators for that there is of course

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,130
challenges many operators has a

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,050
nationwide coverage where many

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,060
enterprises are having a completely

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,150
different coverage it's many countries

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,090
and so on and that might create the need

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,280
for for mitigators in between and and

00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,730
for different business solutions yet to

00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,150
be seen however all of this development

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,570
is ongoing in small scale and and will

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,430
happen as we go for it further

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,680
okay so you're talking about having more

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:59,280
distributed architectures do you think

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,830
that 5g is really going to increase the

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,660
pressure on the service providers to

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,400
virtualize and clarify and get that

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,530
automation do you think that might be

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,190
the catalyst to really try to kick this

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:13,590
thing in gear I don't know how you do 5g

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,870
without that I'm sorry I mean I just

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,490
can't I can't see it happening yeah I

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,020
just it's a non-starter for me I think

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,990
we're already on that path this is the

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,520
the natural kind of trajectory that the

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,800
industry is already moving toward 5g

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,050
becomes the new platform of innovation

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,760
that really is reliant on the path as

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,770
drew said you know of virtualization

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,330
that's already having more automation I

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,010
mean Martin mentioned it as one of the

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,080
impediments and it challenges but it's

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,370
also we're out of the focus and a

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,990
software-defined Network

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,060
software-defined infrastructure is is

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,710
focusing itself and then the use cases

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:49,170
are what becomes enabled on top of that

00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:51,000
absolutely I mean as I said automation

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,880
is key because we need to become more

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,430
efficient and to become more efficient

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,670
without cloud without virtualization and

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,100
new collaborative models is it's

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,720
impossible for me to imagine maybe if

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,790
you just stay with mobile broadband but

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,209
I don't think so all operators are

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,899
looking for growth

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:12,910
yeah absolutely so maybe I'll inject a

00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:15,699
little potential controversy here which

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,449
was always fun that we talked about when

00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:22,629
we had our pre call do you see that open

00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:25,779
source has the potential to accelerate

00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:26,889
5g or perhaps to slow it down there's

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,480
been a lot of discussions this week

00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,730
about the fact that there are so many

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,389
open source projects and a lot of

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,949
uncertainty yet and then we're throwing

00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:38,439
this whole new business model and whole

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:40,059
new types of competition and and things

00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:41,259
into the mix do you think open source is

00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:42,730
going to help accelerate that whole

00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,889
process or do you think it could

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:50,230
actually slow things down and I'm hoping

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:53,319
that you don't agree so it's all of

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,149
these concepts have potential to do a

00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:56,769
number of things good question because

00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:00,759
you could it has the potential to do

00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:03,069
both however the experience and this is

00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,389
you know from our purview our lens of

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:08,369
the world the experience has been that

00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:11,019
the adenosine source approach from a

00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:12,610
broadening of the participant of barrier

00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,220
to participation broadening of the

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,709
innovation that's invited in and the

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,799
sharing of the load frankly has

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:22,689
tremendous value to move an agenda

00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,610
forward for a market

00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:26,170
what's unique a little bit unique about

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,759
the network and open source in the

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,829
network and it really started with NFV

00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,019
in many ways and all the work we've seen

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,279
through other efforts like OPN and v and

00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,869
all of the various consortium and

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,639
communities that have revolved around

00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:38,949
that is that it has brought a mind

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,679
bringing together a mindset that didn't

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:43,509
necessarily naturally collaborate across

00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,759
a market with with entities that weren't

00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:48,309
participating in their sandbox at that

00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,259
time so that's good that's a very

00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,519
important thing it's happened I think

00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,160
we've made as much progress as we've

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,860
seen because of that in many ways but it

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,720
also has the the risk of fragmenting

00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,619
multiple communities looking at the same

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,110
problem from slightly different

00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,670
perspectives and not gravitating towards

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,679
a standard implementation in a way that

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,519
will be mutually beneficial I think

00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,360
we're going to still some of those

00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,589
growing pains to be to be honest but but

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,619
at this but I do believe fundamentally

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:17,019
it has the potential to accelerate

00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:19,209
rather than decelerate we have to be you

00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:20,769
know collectively very mindful that were

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,149
that we're aware of the risk

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,129
and that we're never gating and they're

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,050
in the right direction and but I think

00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:28,660
the benefit is going to be you know

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,110
continue to to accelerate because it

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,100
brings new parties in that are be

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,779
materially part of what kind of

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,910
applications developed on top what

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,439
service has developed on top and with

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,029
the main expertise as each of the

00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:41,920
verticals you know whether you're in

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,920
industrial or in retail like we saw from

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,230
Target are in healthcare or in insurance

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,079
all of those have a value to bring and

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,699
the participation of their own ecosystem

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,369
is more facilitated to open source you

00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:58,689
know I think it's it's not it's a

00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,089
somewhat complicated question to answer

00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:03,160
and let me explain why we know it I I

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:06,610
view open source says there's a problem

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,379
that affects the community and there's

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,850
no real good reason for all of us to go

00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:13,720
solve it you know the exact same way

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,040
right so the the value in terms of what

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,449
we have going on in this move to

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,429
virtualized software to find the network

00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:21,579
I think comes from disaggregating the

00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:22,899
stack into a known set of components and

00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,119
then making that incredibly flexible

00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:26,559
there are open source elements that can

00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,790
play into each one of those components

00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,499
and some out there are very very

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,929
compelling and if you're a carrier and

00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:33,819
you're trying to get the 5g fast and and

00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:35,529
that works for you grab it integrate it

00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:38,259
start stitching that together and put

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,420
that flexible architecture out there at

00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:41,980
the same time you know sometimes I get

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,089
the sense certainly coming to events

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,240
like this you'll go to a couple of

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:47,470
different sessions and you know there's

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,529
one that comes to mind this week you

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,429
know you know somebody put up their

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,199
vision for how they're gonna get to the

00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:54,759
virtualized Network and it was this you

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,899
know kind of logo slide of all these

00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,879
different open source projects that

00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,499
we're going to get them there different

00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,610
levels of maturity of them some of them

00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,790
were sort of competing with one another

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,559
and and sometimes in the midst of these

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,480
big changes you can sort of kind of grab

00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,129
onto that pure open sore the--so ethos

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,679
and kind of say oh this is my goal is to

00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:13,329
go do all this I'd say that certainly is

00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,980
is noble and do it where it makes sense

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,989
but every now and then there might be a

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,160
commercial off-the-shelf product that

00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:20,019
you can fit into one of those layers

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,429
that doesn't inherently limit your

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,779
flexibility that might make you move

00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:25,209
faster right so we talked about

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,279
accelerating decelerating so I'd say you

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,899
know don't you got to look at it and

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,129
make make wise decisions open source

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:32,139
can't accelerate in great many places

00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:34,089
but don't don't go in kind of with a

00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,850
religious view let me just

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,569
example up I and it wasn't a carrier but

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,249
two nights ago

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,569
Amadeus was up here kind of walking

00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:42,160
through their vision for how they

00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:44,829
virtualized their network and moved to

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,509
this software-defined an environment

00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:47,889
took advantage of a great many

00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:49,389
open-source projects if you went through

00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:50,709
the slide but they also if you noticed

00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,029
they grabbed a couple of commercial

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,279
off-the-shelf solutions along the way

00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,680
and they've got a very capable solution

00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,110
in production today so I think it's just

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,699
about making smart decisions as you go

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,279
through an installment

00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:05,800
my point is yes it can accelerate it but

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,589
being almost too ambitious about it

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,559
could could be a decelerator for you at

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:14,589
the same time right I think there are

00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:16,959
values that are important for telecom

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:19,209
that needs to be honored within open

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,490
source it is things like vendor

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:24,610
interoperability and backwards

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:28,029
compatibility right of times in telecom

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,550
is at large much longer than in other

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:33,370
industries and we should also remember

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:36,220
that this world consists of some 650

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,160
operators where not everyone yet has

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,769
learned whatsoever less release so if

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,170
the pace of Technology in changes is too

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,480
fast and if there is no backwards

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:50,829
compatibility no vendor interoperability

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,959
the risk is that lot of operators that

00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:56,019
doesn't have the same capabilities as

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,110
the Tier one operators in the US or in

00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:02,620
China or capable of actually will not

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,230
invest so for open-source to become

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,360
fully relevant in telecom so we can take

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,760
all the good things out of the higher

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,480
innovation pace and so on also the

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,120
values of backwards compatibility venery

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,549
interoperability needs to be honored and

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,860
worked upon in in the open source

00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,959
community it's interesting you say that

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,130
I had a conversation with somebody about

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,490
that this week I think it might have

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,899
been someone from OpenStack and I think

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,630
there's part of what what needs to

00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:32,830
change perhaps is the mindset you know

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,600
the telco see and this is how we've

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,730
always done we've always been able to

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,250
have backward compatibility does is that

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,600
still relevant given that so many other

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,570
things are changing you know does that

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,399
does that mentality still hold water but

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,190
but mindset is one thing think of

00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,590
yourself being head of network

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,800
here in the US and all of a sudden the

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:56,520
network is down in New York for hours

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,170
people can't make 911 calls and then you

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,080
call your vendors please help me and

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:03,120
they start to discuss whose fault it is

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,490
between an interface which isn't defined

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,130
anywhere I don't think you want to put

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,430
yourself in that position it hasn't so

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,930
much to do with sort of mindset versus

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:15,870
standardization versus open source it's

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,730
just that the availability requirement

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,550
that we have in the telecom industry

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:24,330
also from a formal perspective in terms

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:27,390
of legislation is so extreme so these

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,610
things needs to be honored if you should

00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,130
dare to invest here in the u.s. you

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,230
might take the risk because there is so

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,380
much competence so much capability

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:41,690
available we'll see inside the operators

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,340
but move yourself to to Asia and other

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,290
emerging countries the situation is

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,840
different but the requirement on the

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,470
telecom network is the same for

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,820
availability yeah just to comment at an

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,050
observation from talking to customers

00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,610
over agree many times the point you

00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,500
brought up around kind of the tier 2 and

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,480
tier 3 carriers around the world like

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,220
there are real issues in terms of

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
getting good capable resources in some

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,420
of those countries around some of these

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,010
open source projects right and and those

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,450
are the ones who I see personally kind

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,400
of gravitating to more of the commercial

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,690
off-the-shelf model simply because it's

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,300
hard to find the people that can help

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,470
stitch this stuff together and so it'll

00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,570
be interesting to see how this plays out

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,280
because all of these carriers are gonna

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,110
have to shift to this this virtualized

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,580
model and are we going to get kind of

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,580
this two tiered model out at the other

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,810
side of it kind of being big carriers

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,490
that have the wherewithal to kind of

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,170
invest a lot of time to bring this

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,790
together in a very capable way that's

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,980
backward compatible versus those who

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,240
might have had to you know choose some

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,650
off-the-shelf components along the way

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,960
to get that stood up it'll be

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,000
interesting to see how it plays out yeah

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,200
I think the points are well made there

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,820
is an interesting dynamic I think

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,230
interested in it that I don't think it

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,530
isn't either are I agree completely with

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,850
drew but the the you know the theme of

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:55,400
does it accelerate it has a propensity

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:59,130
to accelerate within the the path toward

00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,810
implementations of commercially viable

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,840
for the network and then there'll be a

00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,850
tearing of how much participation occurs

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,120
are not dependent on your own capacity

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,590
to to innovate and invest however if we

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,080
then can enroll ourselves forward a

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,970
couple of years you think of the spirit

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
of or the theme of open source from the

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,970
community perspective we should

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,100
continually see though and upstreaming

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,960
and contribute contribution back into

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,730
the community of some of the innovations

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,040
and learnings such that those who aren't

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,620
as equipped to do much work on their own

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,450
and reliant on more commercial offerings

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,890
are also seeing benefit from that

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,210
innovation through the industry which is

00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,950
down screamed and commercialized through

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,200
those through those product offerings so

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,850
I think it has that you know flywheel

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,850
sort of effect at least the propensity

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,990
for it I still have another question but

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,700
I want to make sure we have time for the

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,470
audience if anybody's got any questions

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,560
we've got about and I are nine minutes

00:20:46,470 --> 00:21:00,780
or so left I can't see if anybody's up

00:20:48,560 --> 00:21:02,970
if not I will ask great panel Ross so

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,670
I'd like to hear from the panelists what

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,820
their feelings are on slicing being able

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:12,360
to disaggregate the network so that you

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,820
get these highly specialized mobile

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,840
cores instead of the one generic core

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:21,720
that everyone offers today and and where

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,760
enterprises might start becoming more

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,940
directly involved especially through

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:34,230
competing open networking technologies

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:37,410
to participate in that slice economy and

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:40,320
network slice seeing it is an important

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:42,620
element of 5g definitely and if you

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,930
think of it you can take for instance

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,270
National Safety Public Security type of

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,010
applications we know that we have Tetra

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,440
network out there which has the rather

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,780
limited coverage compared to cellular

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,110
networks and we know that many police

00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,270
departments are looking into using

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,910
basically cellular networks for their

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:05,880
operations rather than to rely on on

00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:08,150
their own network and if that should

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,610
happen then of course

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:14,240
authorities like that will need to have

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:16,040
their own guaranteed capacity also

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,380
applications where there is a lot of

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,810
people they need maybe to have their own

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,090
codec they might have a way of working

00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,740
with the command chain and other things

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,370
that needs to be supported in the core

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,950
network so absolutely to make slices for

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,170
different industries healthcare industry

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,570
but also entertainment industries like

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,750
gaming and other things is an important

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,790
way to create the network of the quality

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,220
that the different industries are in

00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:47,930
need of I think all of that will happen

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:51,080
and and I think that the challenges on

00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:53,690
us as I said before is that we become

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,030
efficient enough we need to sort of

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,790
recognize that we are today in industry

00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:01,340
which if the company is calling a normal

00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:03,680
operator in a normal country and asking

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,420
for a lawn interconnect is actually

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,530
given the answer that that can be

00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:12,320
delivered in three months I think we

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:15,110
need to sort of take on the challenge of

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,270
being faster and more agile in general

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:20,570
before we really can build those

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:22,610
networks slices at the pace our other

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:26,390
industries adjacent industries are

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:29,120
asking for I think that really well-made

00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:32,030
point and I think you know even within

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,820
the concept of slicing on a per industry

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,890
basis there's the potential for Network

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,100
slicing on a per application or at least

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,080
use case basis performance tolerances

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,030
for one latency tolerances for another

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,410
even a true mentioned earlier more and

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,840
more intelligence moving toward the edge

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,760
of the network in a in a media or video

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,640
consumption environment do you think of

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,310
IOT and all the pensive of applications

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,770
built around video analytics a slice

00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,690
tailor towards the specific requirements

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,070
for those kinds of applications becomes

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,870
possible now if you think of an

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,490
enterprise participating in part of the

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,770
question was how does the enterprise

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,600
participate in that if they consider how

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,670
they run their operation and think of

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,010
the 5g network as a platform for

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,810
innovation for their business it changes

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,000
the dynamics that's how you're I mean I

00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,220
remember you know being concerned about

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,570
setting up an e-1 t1 in two different

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,429
countries for a customer to

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,929
right connectivity imagine if you're

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,909
talking to them about their line of

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,669
business and saying here's how you're

00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:30,440
the network will look uniquely to you to

00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,600
support your business just for that part

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,019
of your line of business that's enabled

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,389
by slicing not all great points it just

00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:39,799
to me it seems history kind of my

00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:41,779
background more on the data center side

00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:43,039
we had to deal with this internally with

00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,179
sort of competing applications those

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,620
already within the data center just

00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:46,580
seems like a logical extension to kind

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,769
of move it out to the rest of the

00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,049
network right I think it has to happen

00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:52,340
and it's going to happen but a lot of

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:55,580
work has to go into it making it

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,240
successful but I would like to make the

00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:02,539
point also that operators has fantastic

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,669
assets if you look on on most countries

00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:07,490
you have central offices in hundreds if

00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,649
not thousands of locations central

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,320
offices can easy be rebuilt to data

00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:14,629
center and that in itself is a

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,600
distributed computing opportunity that

00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:20,480
is unmatched by any other provider of

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,700
cloud on top of that they have thousands

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,490
and thousands of base station all of

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,860
them connected with fibrin and a lot of

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,350
other equipment needed such as cooling

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,629
and so on as of worth this is an asset

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,330
which I think will be very very useful

00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:38,450
also for other industries and and that

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:41,480
that edge computing that distributed

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,159
cloud is an opportunity for the

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,769
operators to really become relevant

00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:57,259
within Network slices to other

00:25:45,769 --> 00:26:00,200
industries so on the back of that 5 G's

00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:02,990
been led by conversations around use

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,730
cases and business models so it's a very

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,370
expensive to bright ultra-low latency

00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,889
the 5g network so the question is

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,230
looking back on history you know invoice

00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:14,179
centric networks we customer we've got

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:19,460
used to paying for minutes and for

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:22,490
messages on SMS and in 3 and 4G networks

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,590
they got used to paying for bandwidth so

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:28,580
my question is it's very expensive to

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:30,980
provide low ultra-low latency capability

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,990
in 5g so will the customer what will be

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:41,389
the business model will customers pay

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:44,600
for latency in those networks so latency

00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:46,340
is very important for entertainment it

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,799
is important for professional

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,409
applications will they be willing to pay

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,159
I think we had a lot of discussions when

00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:57,559
we moved from 3G 2 to LTE with for

00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,870
instance WiMAX where it was said and

00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,659
stated that the cost level of cellular

00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:04,809
networks we wouldn't really allow for

00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:08,990
mobile data usage for mobile broadband

00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:11,570
the cost levels today means that that

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,940
you can find operators in this world

00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:16,820
that sits with an orchid between five

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:20,360
and ten US dollar and and are looking at

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,970
an E bit over sixty percent so I think

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,029
the opportunities for the cellular

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,730
industry over its scale to drive down

00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:31,730
cost to levels where consumption is

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,889
possible is definitely there of course

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,159
as I said before we will need to look at

00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:39,049
automation productivity and efficiency

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,600
but if we can take care of that I'm

00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:44,299
pretty sure that we have the scale the

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,510
technology to find the right price and

00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:49,159
cost points yeah to me it seems logical

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:52,369
that people would be willing to pay for

00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,110
latency and I think that's one of the

00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:55,909
points that we talked about in terms of

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,350
additional economic value add the

00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,809
carriers can provide as being able to

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,700
tear that the wild card and all that

00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:02,660
obviously is government regulators in

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,520
terms of

00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,810
depending upon what country country

00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,940
you're in whether they luck look

00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,800
favorably upon that or not so that's

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,720
kind of a wild card yeah and I think

00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,640
there's an when we've mentioned it in

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,100
some of the earlier sort of comments

00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,980
there's an implicit expectation of

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:22,130
business collaboration and partnering

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,960
and you know maybe an overused term of

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,470
two-sided business models in previous

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,760
technical generation all sort of

00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,800
evolutions but in this case if it truly

00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,470
plays out and it really does fulfill

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,970
that promise then we maybe ought to

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,310
think as an industry differently around

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,410
how we tariffs for what is essentially

00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,240
performance levels around connectivity

00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,860
and what it enables in terms of a

00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,420
business consequence or an experience

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:48,590
and then price according to the tiers of

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,090
granulated services that are enabled as

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,770
a result of it which is maybe the first

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:53,450
time we've truly been able to go do that

00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,660
because the technology enables it to

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,330
occur pricing on a per performant level

00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,250
you know specification wise this level

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,960
of latency that level of security this

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,550
level of performance may be something

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:11,800
that's implicit in the service but it's

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:15,710
presented at a higher level great panel

00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:24,620
what do you see the role of dot 11 e^x

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:27,650
or Wi-Fi and 5g bit carriers role of

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:31,430
Wi-Fi for the carriers I think so there

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:34,430
the it really becomes a question of

00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:37,040
which technology is best suited for the

00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:40,430
application to be supported and where is

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:43,070
their mutual inclusivity between them

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:47,240
and where is there an exclusivity when

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:50,090
you consider the the the the breadth of

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,930
the density and breadth of support that

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,910
5g brings for the carriers are these the

00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,320
com service providers specifically it

00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,930
presents a tremendous opportunity for

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,180
fully automated end-to-end service

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,470
provisioning and really is you know

00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,660
you've seen in some of the sessions this

00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:09,220
week a sort of data center through

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:12,170
network down to application continue of

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,970
flexible provisioning intelligence and

00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,860
management of the of the of the service

00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,250
that does not mean that there isn't a

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,900
role

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,670
to be played for connectivity around

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,440
Wi-Fi because of what it provides but

00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,230
but it's a different set of parameters

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,940
around what's enabled in that way so I

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,800
don't see them as mutually exclusive

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,360
efforts it's more of how one is

00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,800
positioned and muse relative to the

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,930
other four therefore the applications

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,550
that are supporting yeah I don't see

00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:38,150
them as mutually exclusive either but I

00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:41,240
certainly expect to see 5g to put

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:42,850
pressure on Wi-Fi like all our views in

00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,380
terms of where we see that market going

00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:48,500
yes it will come in and supplant Wi-Fi

00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:51,530
in certain use case 5e will enable

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,990
millimeter wave bands 28 gigahertz and

00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,690
other things and will unleash a lot of

00:30:53,990 --> 00:31:00,700
capacity on top of that also the palm

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:03,230
personal area network for for the local

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,270
communities which means that I'm pretty

00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,850
sure that that it will put the pressure

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:10,880
on Wi-Fi for a number of use cases even

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:13,040
if Wi-Fi of course is here to stay great

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,380
thanks that's our time and like to thank

00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:19,659
our panelists thanks very much thank you

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,659
