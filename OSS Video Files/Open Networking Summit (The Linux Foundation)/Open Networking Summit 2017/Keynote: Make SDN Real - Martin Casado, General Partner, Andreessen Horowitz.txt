it's great to be here actually I

00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,950
originally was going to give kind of

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,269
like the VC like talk about kind of

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,790
trends and this and that and do a

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,839
high-level talk you know but I realized

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,840
that it's almost been 10 years to date

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,240
since we started nasira

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,369
almost to the date and a few months ago

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,400
they announced that NSX which is kind of

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,650
a kind of eventual product that was

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,150
created reached a billion dollar run

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,430
rate and so that kind of got me to be a

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,930
little nostalgic and started looking

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,070
back and I thought you know it's got to

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,540
be interesting to do kind of more of a

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,820
personal narrative of like what I

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,829
learned during all of that because I

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,570
really did change the way that I thought

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,399
and so what I'd like to do is I'd like

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:51,030
to talk about kind of a personal arc on

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:53,789
making Sdn real so for those of you that

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,600
don't know so I was at Stanford from

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,460
2003 to 2007 I did is some original work

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,260
that became OpenFlow I was working with

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,470
you know guru and Nick and Scott and so

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,260
forth and when I graduated in 2007 we

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,540
decided to start nasira which was a

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,340
company in the SDM space and so I

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,020
started to dig through our early slide

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,000
deck so this is one of our early slides

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,430
reworking networking for a pitch deck to

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,840
pitch to VCS which I am now is one of

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,229
our old logos I think we went through

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,299
four logos and the original pitch was

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,729
very much the original Sdn pitch we're

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,020
like ok there's two problems here so

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,630
problem number one

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,210
is that if you look at the industry we

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,729
tie specific even customer level

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,890
functionality down to hardware take for

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,259
example security right every time we

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,150
have like say a new security 3 we're

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,229
changing the frame formats and then all

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,509
of a sudden we need a hardware refresh

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,509
and so that just goes against these

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,180
massive trends towards software for many

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,310
aspects and then the second problem is

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,049
when it comes like operational control

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,700
from an operator standpoint not an

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,430
innovator but an operator standpoint

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,810
it's very box centric and in you know

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,210
broad networks this doesn't make a lot

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,030
of sense so let's go ahead and tackle

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,560
that as well and of course our solution

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,390
you know we're academics we popped out

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,430
of Stanford was like okay we're going to

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,650
solve this problem in generality we're

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,599
going to build this network white

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,459
system and these functions these

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,860
customer-facing functions that were in

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,629
hardware now become applications if you

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,370
want security will build a security

00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,780
application you want for networking will

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,709
build a virtual networking application

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,030
and so forth all right so do distill it

00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,829
down features type the hardware

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,430
operation type of box build the general

00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:35,569
platform as far as initial entre point

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,819
we thought we're going to go into the

00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:39,379
virtual data center the reason for this

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,989
is the operational problem was

00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,760
particularly acute I mean VMs had a very

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,030
different life cycle then kind of

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,859
hardware servers and so like the network

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,709
operators there were kind of a lot less

00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:53,239
happy than in other parts of the network

00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,409
and they were greenfield like we're

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,329
getting a lot of these being built out

00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:58,280
they would kind of signal early adopters

00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:01,459
and then we figured we'd go into campus

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,769
and land and everything else all right

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,359
so like good computer scientists we

00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,980
figured okay we're going to build this

00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,109
kind of general platform and and build

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,090
on top of it and so we built this thing

00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:14,049
called Knox which is this kind of open

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,609
source the general Sdn controller and

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:19,150
our idea for an abstraction was like

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:21,349
okay we'll give programmers a graph and

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,209
then we're going to give them all of

00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,160
these great tools to operate on that

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,139
graph they'll have routing protocols

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,519
they'll have state management stuff and

00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:30,440
so we give them all of these things and

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,859
then they can build really interesting

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,230
functions on top of that and I would say

00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:38,659
about six months into this we came up

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,310
with two realizations if the first one

00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,780
and this one never left it still hasn't

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:48,500
left me which is networking is not

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,870
computing computing solves science and

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,790
it solves entertainment and it solves

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,849
you know all of these broad physical

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,949
problems networking is fundamentally

00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,810
about distributed state management like

00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:03,709
almost any network function that you

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:06,049
look at that's what it does right and so

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:07,370
I think that we've taken an approach the

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,919
problem were like okay we want to like

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,109
help developers solve general computing

00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,500
problems when really the complexities

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:19,519
distributed state management and I think

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,099
as a result we're almost a corollary of

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,690
this we're like ok so I'm going to give

00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:25,310
you kind of a centralized where we use

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,930
logically centralized which didn't

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,980
really even

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,390
we're going to kind of somehow reduce

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,090
the complexity of distributed computing

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,500
diagonally giving you one server maybe

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,000
there's kind of some cheats we can do

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,520
maybe can use two or three servers but

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,650
that's good enough and what we soon

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,470
realize is because this problem is about

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,650
distributed state management and for

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,870
networking is inherently an Ncube

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,550
problem you've got n things talking to n

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,440
things so you need to scale so if you're

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,700
going to handle a network of any size

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,480
you're going to have to really

00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:59,390
distribute and it seemed to us that like

00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,420
if you solve n equal three your code

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,890
complexity is equivalent to n right I

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,960
mean there's there's almost kind of in

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,640
the general sense not in a special case

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,470
sense but if you're building a general

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,820
platform you need to solve the full

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,160
complexity of distribution in the

00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,840
platform all right so we're like okay

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,850
fine here's what we're going to do we're

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,380
going to build a new platform and this

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,030
new platform is focused just on the

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,580
problem of distributed state management

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,090
and distribution so this is another

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,930
slide deck I think this one is from 2008

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,280
when you're doing a start-up by the way

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,110
you're always fundraising and always

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,670
pitching so I've got like this nice like

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,200
chronology of like all of our pitch

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:37,100
decks from the ten years that we did

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,540
this and so the idea of onyx is to say

00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,550
okay here's what we're going to do we're

00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,550
building this platform and then this

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,410
platform all of the support to the

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,690
developer is to make it easier to do

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,610
distributed state management now the

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,040
graph was a good idea that was a great

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,230
idea from Knox so you get a graph

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,760
developers get a graph and then that

00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,350
graph could be stored in the number of

00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,990
distributed data structures and it's

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,460
your choice you can use a DHT you can

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,220
use some those equally thing you can use

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,390
an R DBMS and it's fully distributed and

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,030
that will the distribution will be

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,430
handled by those mechanisms and then to

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,780
operate on that graph we're going to

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,920
give you a bunch of tools right we'll

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,190
give you like locking and leader

00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,930
election and so forth and so now you

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,810
know you can have whatever you need to

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,490
implement what you want so there's

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,890
definitely some value there and I think

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,570
the primary value is you'll have a

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,340
number of networking people that are

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,590
used to basically only eventual

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,440
consistency and protocols and you've

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,290
introduced them to a number of new tools

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,630
so there's a lot of value there but the

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,680
reality is is and again this is another

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,070
one of these lessons as

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,750
really stuck with me there really is no

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:47,750
networking problem per se it's like

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,310
almost every aspect of the network is

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,930
different like the data center problem

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,229
is entirely different than the mobile

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,720
problems entirely different than you

00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:59,690
know say the LAN problem and all of

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,630
these have different requirements and

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:05,090
trade-offs when it comes to consistency

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,400
and scalability so it's very difficult

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,220
to fundamentally reduce complexity in

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,560
this type of platform so you can package

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,900
up tools for people you can make a nice

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,509
development library you can introduce

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,460
people to new concepts but the actual

00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,770
code complexity stays the same because

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,960
you have to service surface the same

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,660
level of generality does that make sense

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,520
that you can't reduce the set of options

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,050
that you give to the developer because

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,889
if you're building a general platform

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,389
they need all of them so I do think that

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,090
there was value there but it was mostly

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:39,410
not introducing kind of these

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,080
distributed systems concepts to the

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,690
developers so all along we were kind of

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,190
building this product and so as I

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,099
mentioned before our goal was to solve

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,560
the operations problem and the virtual

00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:54,320
data center here's a slide deck probably

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,210
I don't know say early 2009 or late 2008

00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,169
we're saying okay we're going to build

00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,720
this thing called a virtual network

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:03,409
control this I think our product went to

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,520
like seven iterations of names and the

00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:05,990
idea is you're going to have some

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,550
high-level interface to the virtual data

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,690
center and your operations problems go

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:13,820
away so about this time we realized that

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,300
there was a change that was happening in

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:21,530
the industry and that was the evolution

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,930
of this concept of a V switch so because

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,970
we're focused on virtualization we would

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,919
go you know and see customers running

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,889
VMs and you'd be like wow this one

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,020
server is running a DBMS which is you

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,610
know like 80 machines which is like more

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,370
than we're on the floor of like Stanford

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,899
where I worked and you need networking

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,700
to connect these types of things right

00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,370
not only do you need networking to

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,370
connect these like like they're running

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,020
on x86 so you can put networking on x86

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,839
and do kind of interesting stuff there

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,579
and so we kind of had this idea that

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,640
well this is actually fairly strategic

00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:56,040
fairly interesting

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,589
and also from a start-up and networking

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,060
kind of the key problem is insertion

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,579
it's very difficult to get things

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,589
inserted and now as a pure software

00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:06,660
player we were a software company we had

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,399
this ability to kind of put networking

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,769
functionality that was core

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,079
infrastructure on the data path and I

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:14,490
think this is one of those I think that

00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,490
turn out to be like a fundamentally good

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,019
idea and maybe I look back and the

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,430
entire set of ideas we got a lot wrong

00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,420
but I think this is one of the right

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:26,160
ideas on the other hand Hardware never

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,149
worked for us I can't tell you how much

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,279
R&D effort

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,160
how much p.m. effort how much personal

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,160
time I spent trying to find out ways to

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,040
get as a software player functionality

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,079
into the physical network so as a pure

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,370
software player you know I often we go

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,320
and we have like these meetings with the

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,000
IH fees and we'd be like we would love

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,470
to have this functionality they say

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,529
great we can do anything and then we'd

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,610
ask for an extra bit no TLDs know so

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:52,829
it's very difficult to get the

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,930
functionality we needed but I think

00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:58,560
actually probably the hardest thing for

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,670
a software player a software player and

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,040
when it comes to the harvest supply

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,980
chain is hardware refresh takes five to

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,480
seven years now I was actually just at a

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,660
customer that I've been talking to for

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,010
probably seven years I remember in 2012

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,899
we had a conversation about hardware

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,790
acceleration that was actually available

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,230
in NICs in that time they still haven't

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,790
got the Refresh in their standard supply

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,980
chain and they're not going to change

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:24,600
their supply chain just because of some

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:27,300
software companies okay so we want to go

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,769
and solve the you know operations

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,380
problem in the data center we had a

00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,940
general idea of what we wanted to do but

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,949
more exactly for how that would look

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,690
like so again as good computer

00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:39,990
scientists we wanted to solve the

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,579
problem in generality like okay so we

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,410
want to kind of solve this this

00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:45,029
operations problem how about we do this

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,279
we're going to do a domain-specific

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,230
language because you get the best of

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,089
both worlds you get all the express

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,160
ability of a language so you don't lose

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,870
anything there but it's high-level and

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,250
topology and specific so you get

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,779
simplicity that was the goal so very

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,000
very quickly we realized that this was a

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,310
bad idea for two reasons the first one

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,080
is so it turns out networking is

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,120
actually pretty complex what peope

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,920
we'll need out of it it's not just a

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,170
connectivity matrix it's not just a

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,240
talks to be or does not talk to be its

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,490
broadcast it's multicast it's things

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,220
like P VLANs its static routes its

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,340
service chaining I mean there's so much

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,710
that people want to do and do it was

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,910
never really clear that given all the

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,720
language we did that we can actually

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:34,740
reproduce it correctly but much much

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,320
more fundamental was that as soon as you

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,840
change abstractions you change the

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,510
entire world in which a system lives in

00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,910
all of the tools all of the training

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,630
material even the way that people think

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,460
about it

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,230
right it's almost like detonating the

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,000
explosion like for everything that's

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,850
happened before you have to recreate it

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,890
again and it was pretty clear to us that

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,050
this would be like the biggest adoption

00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,160
hurdle you can ever had if you want to

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,180
teach somebody else how to use a

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,920
high-level language so at this point we

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,240
stepped back and like okay we believe in

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,700
the problem we believe there's this

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,920
operations problem fundamentally and we

00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,420
believe in the types the the pieces of a

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,390
solution we believe you need something

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:18,090
tautology independent we believe that

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,430
you need something that's kind of global

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,020
and so we said well why don't we have

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,730
those abstractions just be networks

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,430
because it solves both of these previous

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,690
problems right it solves the semantics

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,060
problem people can create whatever

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,520
network they want and it solves the

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,750
topology independent problem because

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,990
we're going to make these into actual

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,550
virtual abstractions and by the way I

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,680
think virtualization may be the most

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,050
overloaded term in all of computer

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,450
science so atmósfera virtualization

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,670
that's something very specific which is

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,500
it was true virtualization you should

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,360
start with any type of hardware with any

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,800
addressing model in any service model

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,040
and then on top of that you create any

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,540
other network with any topology and

00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,730
energy addressing model and any service

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,260
model it's a time there was kind of a

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,960
lot of popularity around things like

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,670
slicing which is very useful but slicing

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,350
a segmentation that's where you take a

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,390
network and you give a subset of it to

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,330
somebody else that's not virtualization

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:15,060
virtualization is you have l3 and I give

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:20,470
you l2 or you have l3 ipv4 and I give

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:24,250
you ipv6 and all say this is the P

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:27,190
that made everything finally fit and and

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,080
not just product market fit and not just

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,090
development and not just customers I

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,700
mean it's like everything became easier

00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,910
when we made this decision for example

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,330
like what's our road map became easier

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,830
because you had something to point to

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,020
what features do you implement how do

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,460
you organize an ecosystem because all of

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,900
the stuff has happened in the physical

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,700
world and now you're just replicating it

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,770
and when you wanted to diverge for that

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,620
as a deviation from something everybody

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,510
understood so you know like operational

00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:00,730
support custom support everything became

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:04,030
a lot easier all right so I think we

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,470
were acquired in 2012 so NSX had been in

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:09,340
a market for about two years at that

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:11,350
time and then probably lost a year to

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,900
the acquisition and then we went through

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,490
pretty aggressive revenue ramp so NSX

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,850
ended up being used for three primary

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,080
use cases so I left in last year 2015 it

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,240
was about a six hundred million dollar

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,580
run rate and the three use cases at the

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,250
time were about forty percent was for

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,170
automation so just automating those

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,000
virtual metric abstractions about 40

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,620
percent was for security so basically

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,740
automating security on those those

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:38,260
abstractions and I'd say about 10 15

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,570
percent was intraday to Senator stuff

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,300
another reason why I wanted to show this

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,490
slide is because you know independent

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,200
like how much RNG you do in product

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,760
market fit it still takes a long time I

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,280
mean say six years in this case to

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,980
actually get to significant to get to

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,360
significant revenue all right so I think

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,950
it's worth stepping back and saying okay

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,160
did we achieve what we set out to if you

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,360
look at the the early slide so that's a

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,500
slide from one of the first pitch text

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,420
in the later slide they look entirely

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,760
different right ones this I'm going to

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,490
create this network OS and the other one

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,740
is you know I'm going to we're going to

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,750
do virtual networking and I think the

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,480
answer to that is just kind of qualified

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,570
sort of I mean if you look at the high

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,280
level goals I think we nailed those

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,260
right you decouple harbor from software

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,790
absolutely you provide network wide

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,250
control over high level of abstractions

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,870
yes we didn't know how we were going to

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,250
get there and we certainly have these

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,630
ideas that we're going to move two camps

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,130
in one which never happened I'm going to

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,070
explain later why I think that

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,900
but I definitely think like with respect

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,680
to the original goals you know we kind

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,840
of fitted in there I just want to talk

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,460
about things that in retrospect may be

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,430
obvious at the time I wish I would have

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:51,640
known them and the first one is you know

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:54,030
if I had to do it all over again I think

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,440
I'd focus just on the application and

00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,820
the thing is it's actually not there's

00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,350
actually not a lot of complexity in

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,550
building one of these general platforms

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,650
and I'm kind of more and more of the

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,830
opinion that it doesn't even make sense

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:09,010
to have a general Sdn platform because

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,140
the problems are so different that it

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,080
may make sense to have a land platform

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,950
and a data center platform and you know

00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,750
something like that

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,460
but one that tries to solve all of these

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,870
the problem is is in order to be really

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,670
useful you have to be sufficiently

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,220
general and then you end up basically

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,780
becoming like a library of protocol

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,850
wrappers or something like that so

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,110
there's some value but it's not

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,550
something to over rotate on especially

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,490
from an R&D side and this is something

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:38,040
we just simply got wrong I mean the vast

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:40,540
majority of our time was spent on this

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,160
another thing is if you look at kind of

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,160
the minimum time to get something done

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,380
it's almost always dwarfed in market

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,540
category creating situations from

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,400
changing consumer behavior like if you

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,840
know what to build and that takes a long

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,700
time to figure out if you know what to

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,590
build like that River transition that

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,480
took us two and a half years doesn't

00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,310
take that long often to get into market

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,770
but then to actually clean the markets

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,540
use it takes a really long time and so a

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,069
big takeaway that I have is you know

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,390
instead of I kind of dithering around on

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,010
a platform you want to get in the market

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,410
about as quickly as possible

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:14,020
in order to kind of get that feedback

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,000
start the education process and to kind

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,160
of put a finer point on this like we

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,199
often talk about how slow or how fast

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,900
software is in households hardware is

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,120
but at the end of the day this all comes

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,220
down to basically the speed in which an

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,810
industry moves so in as much as you're

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,610
planning anything you need to be

00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:35,260
realistic about how long it takes for

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:37,800
the industry to move along okay so very

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,810
quickly so the key lessons for me

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,300
product before platform the second line

00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,160
if you're doing some category creation

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,600
thing virtualized before changing

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,340
abstraction changing extraction

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,880
really does change the world software

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,860
before hardware I guess that's pretty

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,970
straightforward and then and I didn't

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,620
have time to talk to this but over time

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,850
the majority of resources in an

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,169
enterprise company actually goes to

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,549
sales and go to market it works

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,830
everything if you look back at the

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,360
revenue slide that I showed before the

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,960
majority of time an investment actually

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,610
is that that sales ramp and you know if

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,470
you don't focus on that early and get

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,850
that dialed down I think that's one of

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,490
the biggest failure motive a lot of

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,480
early startup companies alright so I

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,600
just want to give one final thought

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,809
before setting things up QA so the first

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,520
one is you know success is over

00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,080
determined I'm a venture capitalist now

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,580
and in recent Horowitz and you hear many

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,200
success sorry so what is over

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,130
determining over determinism

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,690
mathematical expression and an over

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,240
determined system is London where you

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,770
have more variables and equations okay

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,270
so if you have more variables in

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,770
equations you don't really know what the

00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,120
right answer is because it's over

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,179
determined right so a number of

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,799
solutions will solve the equation right

00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,809
and success is one of those things if

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,640
you have a successful outcome everybody

00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:56,260
will tell you like why this is the case

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,700
right because it's an over determined

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,360
system I mean there's many things that

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,490
went into it and I mean it's very

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,039
difficult to know kind of what makes a

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,820
successful journey to this kind of crazy

00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:11,799
crooked life and path that we have but

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,330
it does share one thing in common with

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,240
venture capital doing a start-up which

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:20,350
is you can make an awful lot of bad

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:23,169
decisions but a few key decisions really

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,610
drive all of the outcomes I mean if I

00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,690
look back at all the things that we got

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,130
wrong there's a lot but there's a few

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:31,480
things we got really really right

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,640
but unlike venture you can't take a

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,539
portfolio approach to this right unlike

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,700
venture you make these bets in serial

00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:41,380
right so you acknowledge that failure is

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,059
a total requirement there's no way to

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,470
get there without failing and actually I

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:48,700
think the failures will probably

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,990
outweigh the successes but you can't

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,200
place them all in parallel like you

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,640
can't adventure so it seems to me like

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,440
ultimately you know being an

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,660
entrepreneur and driving something to

00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,790
market

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,180
the fundamental trick is your balancing

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,620
two pieces or two types of kind of human

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,340
nature the first one is self-delusion

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,690
which is you're trying to do something

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,510
and you can see how it needs to be done

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,220
and so you believe it's happening when

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,170
it may not be happening so you need to

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,400
kind of be able to kill your darlings it

00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,950
turns out like a general controller

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,180
platform maybe not that successful on

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,710
the other hand you've got to balance the

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,510
human nature for impatience which is

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,420
actually as I showed you before it takes

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:30,030
five to seven years for a market to

00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,890
mature and so I think like like the

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,450
entire key is to try and figure out like

00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,450
how do you know when to stay the course

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,890
and how do you know when to hit and you

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,330
know again to go back to it I think that

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,190
without actually being piped into the

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,470
nervous system of the product market fit

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,640
it's very difficult to do that and so

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,900
with that I would love to open up the

00:20:44,640 --> 00:21:01,370
questions - thank you so much for your

00:20:45,900 --> 00:21:03,600
time time this morning I'm Martine yeah

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,790
I'd like to ask you a personal question

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,790
like I did Justin yesterday and there's

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,530
I always thought that you are going

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,310
having watched you and actually I

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:17,580
learned about Sdn meeting with this

00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:20,130
stealth startup nice Sarah a seven eight

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,930
however many years ago yeah but I've

00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,800
watched you then as they entrepreneur

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:27,840
and then now as a VC it seems like

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,750
you're really happy in your new role but

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,820
I always thought you'd had this

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,370
entrepreneurial Drive in you that would

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,990
make you get back into something and I

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,650
thought maybe sitting in the seat you

00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:43,080
are now you're always watching for the

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,750
next event that Martine is going to put

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,200
it will learn again - yeah I think it's

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,820
question so um listen I I devoted 10

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,460
years of my life to going about as deep

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,840
as anybody can go into one thing and it

00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,070
was amazing it was a great experience

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,720
you know you pay collateral in other

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,190
ways right you know I kind of scorched

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,080
her with my personal life while I did

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,970
that and I feel like you know I feel

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,310
like I've done it and I feel very good

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,650
about that and now this is a kind of a

00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,430
fantastic opportunity for me to go broad

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,260
and

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,760
I do think some of like the chips that

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,370
are going on in the industry right now

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,260
are abroad right I mean like like things

00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,520
that are like industry broad like the

00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,650
movement to the developer and the

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,270
disruption of open source and so I mean

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,820
listen how many decades does one having

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,500
a life you know I've already used one

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,740
and so I'm really excited to be doing

00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,880
something that still draws from you know

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,740
what I've learned in the past and my

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,540
experiences but it's a very very

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,500
different skillset for me to apply to so

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,590
I'm actually very happy with the

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,540
decision to change great question things

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,060
I'm a clean mark okay Nene hey so thanks

00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:48,300
for the you know very nice retrospective

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:52,070
area drawing thank you um however as any

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:54,960
as an academic right there is a the

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,030
ultimately did did the talk and and

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,460
messages you draw since intellectually

00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,470
not really rewarding okay I remember six

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,690
years ago around this time Scott

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,670
Schenker came to these Fox and was

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,830
trying to convince us that we now got

00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:10,110
the right obstructions and we should not

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,430
you know be able to overdo the exercise

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,310
anymore because these are the right

00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:17,430
obstructions there so today if I were to

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:20,760
you know walk away what is it that I

00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:23,420
should take from your talk in terms of

00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,820
you know this type of failure that you

00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,380
you are meeting to in a sense at the

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,960
level of the instruction is it really

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,430
the case that there is a nice set of

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,590
attractions that we had but they don't

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,610
really apply in practice or is it

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,520
something that we could do as

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,650
researchers and go back go back and see

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,660
if we got the abstractions also wrong

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,430
yeah that's a good question so I think

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,000
that there's two primary takeaways one

00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:52,650
of them is like until you really try and

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,490
kind of change like deployment practices

00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:58,350
you don't really realize how much

00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,500
technology isn't in a bubble like you

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:05,970
really don't and so much of the type of

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,350
technology that we need to create we

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,570
need to create it in a way that people

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,670
understand it you have to write because

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,840
ultimately people are paying dollars for

00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,130
this and they're putting the job on the

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,280
line and they've got existing training

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:20,220
and if you don't take that outside view

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,710
in I think it's very difficult to

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,440
actually have impact and so as a result

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:28,470
of that it's bucket

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,100
better from an abstraction standpoint to

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,630
be incremental because it's almost like

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,300
inserting that level of indirection into

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,750
the world so one of the like very key

00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,590
takeaways is you really want to

00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,390
virtualize before you change

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,520
abstractions because exactly that

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,630
doesn't change the abstractions what's

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,100
interesting though is once you do that

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,600
actually you have the opportunity to

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,100
change abstractions if you look at

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,460
modern uses of network virtualization

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,290
solutions today they actually have

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,970
high-level policy languages built on top

00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,190
of them and the reason is is because

00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,050
you've educated the customer base on

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,000
that you can do all of this new

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,660
operations stuff albeit with old

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,490
abstractions and then now you can start

00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,810
incrementally adding these abstraction

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,000
on tops you've got an insertion point

00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,100
you've also changed the customer

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,110
behavior and so I mean I think that you

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,340
know the two takeaways are listed you've

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,680
got a real world that you've got to snap

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,990
into but that's not necessarily a bad

00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,910
thing I just think that you want to

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,650
solve that problem first otherwise you

00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,290
get nowhere you go to zero and then

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,720
after that you want to solve kind of the

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,040
broader issues I says well actually

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,630
we're out of time but thank you so much

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,059
for for the time thank you

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,059
