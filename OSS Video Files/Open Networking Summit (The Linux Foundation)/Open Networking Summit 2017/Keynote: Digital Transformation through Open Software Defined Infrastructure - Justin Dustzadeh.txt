good afternoon everyone very excited to

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,890
be back at the Open Networking summit

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,929
this time to talk about enabling digital

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,009
transformation through open

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,990
software-defined infrastructure in the

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,680
short time that we have today I will

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:24,359
first spend a few minutes to talk about

00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:27,750
who we are and what we do at at visa

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,849
I will then share some thoughts about

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,930
our technology transformation vision as

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,000
well as our approach to building an open

00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,380
software-defined infrastructure

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,219
including some of the guiding principles

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:45,149
and drivers behind their vision I will

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:49,590
then spend a few minutes to outline an

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,539
open architectural framework for a data

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,670
center network architecture based on

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,489
Software Defined Networking and we'll

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,059
also talk about some use cases for Sdn

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,760
or software-defined networking for the

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,470
wide area networks time permitting I

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,619
will then spend some time on the

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,960
migration aspects of Sdn and also what

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,450
we as a community can do to help

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,590
accelerate the industry at the option of

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:20,189
software-defined technologies who is

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,250
visa visa is a Global Payments

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,630
technology company we connect consumers

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,680
businesses financial institutions

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,729
strategic partners and government

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,770
entities in over 200 countries to fast

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:39,720
reliable and secure electronic payments

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,299
our advanced transaction processing

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,090
network facilitates the authorization

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,909
clearing and settlement of digital

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,520
digital payments and also enables us to

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,570
offer a wide range of product and

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,670
value-added services to our customers

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,909
visa operates in a four party model as

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,460
can be seen on this slide including

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:06,000
merchants the card issuing banks and the

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,509
acquiring banks as such we are not a

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,780
bank we don't issue cards we don't set

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,220
credit or credit limits or rates or fees

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:22,170
for the

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:26,940
account holders of visa products as one

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:29,400
of the world's largest retail electronic

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,180
payments networks our infrastructure

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,960
today serves over 16,000 financial

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:41,640
institutions and enables over 129

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,340
billion payment transactions a year for

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,900
a total volume of 8.2 trillion u.s.

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:53,720
dollars at some 65,000 transaction

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,670
messages per second while these numbers

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,640
speak to the already significant scale

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,000
of our infrastructure we foresee a

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,550
continued growth of electronic payments

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,700
driven by new technologies new

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:14,240
innovations as well as a shift of

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:17,970
consumer habits these drivers include an

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,489
accelerated growth of e-commerce and a

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,720
rapid migration of e-commerce to mobile

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:27,390
devices but also there is a number of

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,090
underlying enabling technologies that

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,540
are creating new payment models such as

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,730
block chain or tokenization which is a

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,400
technology that allows you to replace

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,239
the card number with a digital token to

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,190
make the transaction more secure this

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,620
technology for example can be in the

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,480
internet-of-things ecosystem where every

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,440
connected device can now become a

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,750
potential point of sale these new

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,299
technologies and trends will continue to

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,110
emerge and evolve as we move toward the

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:04,080
cashless society and these technologies

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,000
and drivers will continue to set new

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,600
requirements and the infrastructure in

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,260
terms of growth resiliency security

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,630
scale performance and unit cost such new

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,040
drivers and requirements are at the

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,120
heart of our technology transformation

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,120
work at visa

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,509
a great focus of our transformation

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:31,990
journey is really around leveraging

00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:35,889
software to create an increasingly open

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,750
digital platform for innovation but also

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,969
increasing the agility of the

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,199
infrastructure and adding layers of

00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:46,120
security and operational resilience it

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,449
is also about making electronic payments

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,219
accessible to everyone worldwide today

00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,050
about half of the population on earth

00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:56,590
does not have access to electronic

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,659
payments and as we grow and expand our

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,240
infrastructure we need to make sure that

00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:04,930
we can continue to offer the same and

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,199
greater levels of resilience security

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:14,560
and agility to billions of connected

00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:17,169
devices and users a big part of our

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,659
thinking is around moving away from

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:22,090
closed and proprietary physical

00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:25,029
infrastructure devices to open and

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,550
software based technologies to be able

00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,159
to build that agility in software and

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:36,240
offer on demand infrastructure and

00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:39,219
network services to our customers in

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,960
2015 we launched visas developer

00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:46,029
platform which now offers over 180 of

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,190
visas product and service functions

00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:55,419
through api's to our customers and

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:57,250
partners some of the examples of

00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,750
architectural principles that we are

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,710
embracing as part of this technology

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,509
transformation journey includes

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,569
leveraging software to build resilience

00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:11,110
independently of hardware we know that

00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:13,599
hardware can fail circuits can fail port

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,270
or an interface can go down but we need

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:18,099
to make sure that we can build

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,400
resilience availability and security in

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:23,860
software independently of hardware so

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,770
that no single failure or even multiple

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,930
failures of network or infrastructure

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:33,039
devices would result in any service

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,169
impact and separation of hardware and

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,680
software is a big portion of that

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,270
and as we grow and expand our

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,819
infrastructure we need to make sure that

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,430
we can continue to maintain real-time

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,370
full visibility across the entire data

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,289
path in our infrastructure and once

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:55,120
again that can only be achieved in

00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:57,219
software at scale we're also looking at

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,180
opportunities to maximize the acid

00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:04,449
utilization not just from a PCO

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,729
advantage perspective but also from the

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,469
standpoint of improving the efficiency

00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,750
of our operations and actually making

00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:14,139
the infrastructure more resilient and

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,000
more highly available these ideas

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,400
include things like consolidating

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,770
separate physical networks into one

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,960
common fabric both on the website as

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,990
well as the data center side but also

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,580
simplifying and reducing the number of

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:32,919
stack layers that we have in the

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:36,550
networking stack let's now talk about a

00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:41,650
framework for an open software-defined

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,930
data center network architecture in this

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:47,199
example more suitable for an enterprise

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:50,800
environment everything starts with

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,839
building a physical network fabric that

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,759
you want to keep as simple as possible

00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:01,089
leveraging reliefs spine topology design

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,479
for improved scale and resilience as

00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:07,599
well as the support of micro services

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:10,060
but also leveraging simplified slash

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,759
commoditized Hardware with merchants

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:17,589
silicon chips and a minimal set of

00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,699
standard networking features next you

00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:20,919
want to make sure that you keep your

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,770
architecture modular and your

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,819
abstraction layers well-defined

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:28,270
including the network switching and

00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:31,330
virtualization then a software layer for

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,729
network orchestration monitoring control

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,120
and management and then your application

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:39,279
layer where you can have different types

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,740
of workloads including

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,169
bare metal or non virtualized workloads

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,579
that can interface directly with your

00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,150
hardware such as Hadoop or spark or you

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:51,670
can have

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,370
virtualized workloads such as VMs and

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,960
containers for which you might want to

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,630
leverage some sort of a network

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,200
virtualization technology and then as

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:05,110
your virtualization footprint grows you

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,470
might want to leverage and deploy a

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,750
dedicated Sdn controller platform to

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,500
manage that state centrally and at scale

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,860
and it is extremely important that the

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,020
interface between that consolidated

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,180
unified Sdn controller with the rest of

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,330
your physical infrastructure be open and

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,580
a standard base so that you can select

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,520
the best of the breed technologies for

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,380
each of these components you might also

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,630
want to leverage some virtualized

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,900
Network functions for layer 4 layer 7

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,640
functionality such as load balancers

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,160
firewalls etc and manage that whole

00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,960
physical infrastructure from within that

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,550
Sdn controller now in a real word

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,440
enterprise data center environment you

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,020
have other networking functionalities

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,570
that need to be provided these can

00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,730
include a packet capture fabric for

00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,680
which you can similarly leverage

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,040
simplified and commoditized Hardware

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,240
with some Sdn capabilities as well as an

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,670
out-of-band

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
network management fabric that can

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,070
interface with the rest of your physical

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,230
fabric now once you have built all of

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,330
that you want to make sure that you can

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,090
actually leverage and harness the true

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,790
power of software through an

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,650
orchestration platform where as the

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,600
previous speaker mentioned with the

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,340
point with the point in a click you can

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,100
actually provision your infrastructure

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,620
and build whatever network service that

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,550
you want without having any knowledge of

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:39,160
the hardware and equally importantly it

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,200
is important that that interface be open

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,120
similarly to the Sdn controller

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:51,160
interface now let's shift gears and talk

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:53,050
about one so outside the data center

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,160
typically an enterprise has some sort of

00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:58,900
an network or wide area network starting

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,390
from the left side of the slide an

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,470
enterprise might have a number of remote

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,940
sites these

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:10,210
includes branches or customer premises

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,160
or a number of users that just connect

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,290
to your environment through internet and

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,500
or through some sort of a carrier

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,660
managed connectivity and then you have

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,420
your data centers either one or several

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,910
of them typically connected through a an

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,340
enterprise managed data center

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,260
interconnect or back wall network and

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,510
then you might have some presence in a

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,520
public cloud so here the blue boxes

00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,510
represent the areas where the enterprise

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,730
has some visibility and control and the

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,300
rest is really kind of third-party

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,860
management so while this model works for

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,670
many enterprises and in many use cases

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,110
it comes with some challenges you

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,890
typically have some sort of a legacy

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,570
router or technology on the exercise and

00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,920
for the vast majority of the transport

00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,040
network you don't really have much

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,930
visibility and control and if you have

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,710
thousands of these devices and if you're

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,660
running a mission-critical environment

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,910
that whole process of managing the

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,110
lifecycle of these devices which can

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:18,660
come in thousands can be pretty

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:21,460
significant now software-defined

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,170
networking can help address some of

00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,710
these challenges and there are several

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,290
scenarios and deployment models I will

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:33,310
talk about three use use cases there are

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:36,610
more in this use case a carrier can

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:39,430
offer an SDN solution at the edge of the

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,640
network where networking functionality

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,740
is moved from these and devices to the

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,260
edge of the network and then in a

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,450
virtualized environment you have some

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,550
sort of a VC PE environment where you

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,440
can actually manage your networking

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,200
capabilities and create some interesting

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,080
service chaining functions and manage a

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,230
large number of your end devices from

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:06,700
that point of presence or edge of the

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,920
network and then you have a similar set

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,650
up a determinating site where the

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,400
traffic is handed over to your data

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,240
centers so this model does offer great

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,160
advantages in

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,880
terms of simplifying the operations of

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,959
your van infrastructure but also it

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,959
might come with some challenges

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:31,930
typically if you require carrier

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,790
redundancy at the axis you want to make

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,370
sure that the carrier that offers this

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,700
service can actually offer carrier

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:43,120
redundancy and an environment where you

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,570
can leverage access connectivity from

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,810
multiple providers but also leverage

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:52,180
internet or even wireless but also in

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:55,029
the wine side you want to make sure that

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:58,390
the Sdn solution that the carrier offers

00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:00,490
is unbundled from the carrier transport

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,770
offering so that you can actually work

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:07,930
with multiple carriers for the transport

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:11,610
of your network if needed a second use

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:15,790
case is when the enterprise kind of

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:18,250
replaces the legacy equipment and the

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:22,480
access side and actually works with an

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:24,820
SD van vendor so here I put two vendors

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,230
the kind of light blue vendor and the

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,510
green vendor this model can also work

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,270
very well because now you have a global

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,310
state of your endpoints and your

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:38,709
exercise that can be managed centrally

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,370
from within software from your data

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:45,160
center with this model similarly to the

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,350
previous model you can actually create a

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:52,060
lot more interesting traffic engineering

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,709
and policy-based routing decisions and

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,890
actually manage the state of your

00:14:53,709 --> 00:15:01,420
endpoints centrally and from within

00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:02,980
software so a few important

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,399
considerations with this model is that

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,890
if you're a large enterprise and you

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,390
have many endpoints deployed around the

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:15,610
world you might want to decide that you

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,680
want to have different vendors or two or

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,260
three vendors and partition your network

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,870
and it is important that you don't have

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,820
to deploy a new set of controller

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,480
platforms and management platforms every

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,829
time you bring a new vendor so as such

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,939
it is important that

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:36,189
the southbound for this devices also be

00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:37,809
open and multi-vendor compatible and

00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:40,989
that is the light that is the yellow

00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:46,809
line that I put on top of the SD van or

00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:49,869
router devices next scenario is when the

00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:53,679
enterprise actually expands the backbone

00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:56,499
network as far as possible and as close

00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:59,410
as possible to the end-users this way

00:15:56,499 --> 00:16:01,559
effectively managing the large portion

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,089
of the end-to-end path themselves

00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:07,269
instead of relying on third party

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:11,009
carriers so in this scenario the

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:13,689
enterprise not only owns and manages the

00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:16,269
data center interconnect Network but

00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:18,420
also the wine backbone and now the

00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:23,589
enterprise has the opportunity to deploy

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:25,899
these SDRAM solutions at the pub or at

00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,569
the edge of their network and only rely

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,639
on third party carriers and other

00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:33,489
methods of access for the van access

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,939
portion so here with this model you can

00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:39,249
actually have a number of pubs around

00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:42,399
the edge of your network geographically

00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:44,439
spread and then from there on manage

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,809
your endpoints that can connect your

00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:49,660
network either through internet or

00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:53,499
through wireless or through a number of

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,959
carrier provided MPLS circuits so each

00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:59,110
of these scenarios has pros and cons and

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,269
advantages or disadvantages depending on

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,649
how much visibility you want to gain how

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,139
much control you want to have on your

00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:09,059
infrastructure end to end and also the

00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:13,569
capex and OPEX resources involved is

00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:16,630
different for each case independently of

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:20,020
which model you want to go for it is

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:22,740
important to understand that in order to

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,230
make the adoption of these solutions

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,500
easier these solutions need to be open

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,090
and come with standard interfaces it is

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,090
equally important that these solutions

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,529
can be easily and seamlessly integrated

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,679
with the enterprise's operational

00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:41,260
environment but also it is important

00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,820
that the engineers in an enterprise

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,179
organization can

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,860
has these capabilities and also test the

00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:52,419
interoperability between different

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:54,250
multiple vendor solutions in software so

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,139
it is important that vendors offer a

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,590
virtualized environment for these

00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:02,529
platforms so that you can have the kind

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,039
of network CIC the environment to test

00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:07,600
and evaluate these solutions it is also

00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:12,700
important that these solutions be

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,950
flexible so no vendor lock-in Hardware

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,379
independence is also equally important

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,889
and as I mentioned it is important that

00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:26,230
the carrier transport be independent

00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:29,799
from the carrier SDRAM solution needless

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,230
to say that these SDRAM solutions need

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,720
to maintain or even improve the carrier

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,330
greatness of the typical and networking

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,629
solutions that we are used to and but

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,309
also provide the global support and come

00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:48,279
with the right level of security

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:52,720
hardening I will now say a few words

00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:54,370
about the migration aspects of Sdn a few

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,039
years ago in the open networking

00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:00,429
foundation within the migration working

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,669
group a number of documents were

00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:06,309
published to describe the use cases the

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:09,070
methodologies as well as the tools that

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:12,309
should be considered during an SDM

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:16,210
transformation journey and this slide

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:18,789
kind of highlights some of the thought

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,769
process from that work so and we

00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:21,309
published the blog by that name by the

00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:23,289
way

00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:25,360
so the thought process is pretty

00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:27,580
straight forward you have a starting

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,450
infrastructure you go through a phased

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:35,049
migration phase step and then you have

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:37,210
your target Sdn based infrastructure you

00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:40,840
want to make sure that you're starting

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,519
network is well understood and that the

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,879
state is well understood and that you

00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,710
have well-defined back-out procedures so

00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:49,840
if during the migration something goes

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,049
unexpectedly you have the right

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,539
mechanism in place to roll it back and

00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,620
then during the phased migration you

00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,900
want to make sure that

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,180
you have continuous availability and

00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,500
also the right tools in terms of

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:07,809
monitoring provisioning and

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,150
troubleshooting and then once all that

00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:15,040
migration work is done how do you make

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:17,170
sure that you actually have the SLA that

00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,420
you had previously and that in this new

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,640
environment you have the right paybacks

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,240
from an operational perspective and

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,000
these are not just on paper theoretical

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,040
work these are things that actually we

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,230
have been doing at visa as part of our

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:38,230
migration process toward these new

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:39,610
technologies so a brief summary of some

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,730
of the thoughts that I mentioned in

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:46,300
terms of coming together as a community

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,920
to help accelerate the adoption of Sdn

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,920
and software different technologies

00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:56,230
there has been a great momentum to move

00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,850
away from hardware centric solutions to

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,890
software-defined technologies and as of

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,480
recently there has been announcement

00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,940
there have been announcements for even

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,130
established vendors to make they're

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,580
always available to run on third-party

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,100
hardware this is a great example of a

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,650
very good step in the right direction

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,820
so let's come together to do more of

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:27,100
that kind of shift from hardware centric

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:28,870
to software-defined offerings it is

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,870
important that all these Sdn solutions

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,730
whether it's on the data center side or

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:37,390
on the wine side

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:39,460
remained vendor neutral and offer multi

00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:43,420
vendor deployment opportunities to

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,730
enterprises and customers do not put

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,160
that work and the shoulder of the

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,200
enterprise so that the engineers that

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,750
are trying to build and deploy these

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:58,480
solutions actually have to do all that

00:21:52,750 --> 00:22:00,160
hard integration work also we need to

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,770
make sure that these solutions can

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,780
easily and smoothly be integrated in the

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,780
enterprise's operational environment

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,140
in most enterprises there is a lot of

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,929
focus on availability and operational

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,360
effectiveness and many enterprises try

00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:21,230
to leverage the best of the breed tools

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,210
to detect anomalies and outages and

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:27,400
failures as quickly as possible

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:29,809
so every time a new solution is is

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,540
deployed we need to make sure that these

00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:35,540
solutions can be easily integrated in

00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:38,900
existing operational platforms and once

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:44,600
again open api's is the right answer to

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:46,130
that similarly to the example that I

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,590
mentioned with a reason developers

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,330
platform business developer platform

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,160
let's make sure that whatever capability

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,440
we are building in the community we make

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,630
it accessible and available through

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,460
api's to the community so that we can

00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,669
build greater synergies and

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:05,690
opportunities for for more sdn

00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:09,230
deployments and finally let's make sure

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:12,669
that the Sdn solutions can coexist with

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:15,590
legacy environments there is a lot of

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:18,049
deployments today and enterprise but

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,200
also across the industry on greenfield

00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:23,230
deployments but in many cases these Sdn

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,850
solutions need to be deployed in

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,080
environments where there will be a mix

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:31,429
of legacy with greenfield technologies

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,809
with that thank you very much for your

00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:35,410
time I'm now happy to take questions

00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:35,410
from the audience

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,940
Justin

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:55,940
hello amazing change you went from

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,750
hallway CTO type or your building

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,460
products and developing next-generation

00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:05,330
products working with customers but now

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:07,549
you are a customer it seems like a huge

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,350
change and a lot more responsibility

00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,240
when you have all those transactions and

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,059
all those billions and billions running

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:19,399
through the network every day what you

00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:22,250
look thinner how do you compare the two

00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:24,289
jobs I think this one's more challenging

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:29,360
but can you say something about that

00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:31,519
your journey absolutely so this talk is

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:37,639
really about what we have been doing at

00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:39,559
visa I'm happy to answer that so last

00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:41,899
time I was here I remember I talked

00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:45,470
about accelerating the pace of

00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:48,380
innovation by leveraging Sdn and there

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:53,090
were a lot of great ideas and proof of

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:55,490
concept types of ideas and at visa we

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,460
have really been putting those ideas and

00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:02,269
concepts to practice and some of the

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,980
ideas that I mentioned are actually part

00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:06,350
of our network transformation journey

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,820
and a lot of the story that I mentioned

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,760
here is already well underway

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,889
in terms of what we do to really take a

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,080
very large-scale mission-critical

00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:17,120
environment through this journey and

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,950
leverage software and software-defined

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,100
networking and show that it can work

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,960
both on the land side as well as the as

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,929
well as the data center side and as I

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,240
mentioned some aspects that I believe

00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:31,610
have not been talked about enough in the

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,130
industry over the last few years is how

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,049
do you make sure that you can easily

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:38,750
operationalize as the end a lot of

00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:41,539
things look nice on paper but when you

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:44,029
try to put this into a mission-critical

00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:46,850
environment and try to drive that change

00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:48,679
in flight it is a different story so

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,990
there is a lot more work that we need to

00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,529
do as a community to lower the barrier

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,360
to entry for large enterprises and

00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:58,580
organizations that are actually managing

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,080
a mission-critical environment thank you

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,520
for the great question happy to see you

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,860
again

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:12,280
please a post migration how much of the

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,860
big bender like around Tasman Drive you

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:19,360
know the Big C how much of that was left

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:22,750
or later how much of a part is it

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,970
playing in your infrastructure now I'm

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:28,270
sorry can you I'm not sure I understood

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:34,090
the question aiming the vendor right the

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:36,580
vendor our Tasman Drive the Big C how

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:41,800
much of that is left in your

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:45,490
infrastructure post migration if I

00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:48,630
understood your question correctly I'm

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:53,050
not sure I can speak to the details of

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:54,400
of how much infrastructure from a

00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,350
particular vendor is left in our

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,500
organization but I can tell you that we

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,450
are working with all vendors including

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:04,830
established ones who all are going

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:07,450
through this transformation journey and

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,309
we are trying when we have the

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,440
opportunity to leverage the best of the

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:15,400
breed technology component for each part

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,840
of the network so as I mentioned in one

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,550
of the slides we are seizing the

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,920
opportunity to go from closed

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,990
proprietary technologies to to more open

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,150
and self to based solutions and I think

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:27,400
across the board all vendors both

00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,580
established ones as well as the startups

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,240
are actually embracing that that

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:37,210
movement

00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:39,300
thank you next question I just in thank

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,820
you for sharing your your journey into

00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:47,220
you know establishing this this Sdn into

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,220
your infrastructure could you tell it

00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:54,850
yes could you tell us how much

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,890
lots of question how much of your

00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,470
infrastructure has been migrated to Sdn

00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:02,680
and how much of it is left on as you

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:05,590
describe the legacy hardware are you a

00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,260
hundred percent now Sdn driven are you

00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,240
using SD and a hundred percent as in

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,340
terms of your infrastructure or you

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,670
fifty percent there ten percent there

00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,800
could you give us an idea it is hard to

00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,360
quantify but across the board as I

00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:24,100
mentioned it it's a journey

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,980
it is a full spectrum where we have

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,230
opportunities to deploy Greenfield

00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,960
deployments we are definitely seizing

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:35,200
the opportunity to to leverage Sdn but

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,000
our infrastructure is large and it is a

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,160
journey that we are going through so the

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,680
short answer is I cannot really tell you

00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,120
the exact quantified number in terms of

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,240
the percentage of the infrastructure

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,180
that has been already migrated to Sdn

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,490
but that effort is well underway and it

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,550
is making good progress please next

00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,260
question so is really interested by your

00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,670
different network architecture diagrams

00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,300
it took me a while to realize that

00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,560
you're describing sort of the

00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,860
infrastructure of visa that you're

00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,510
migrating from legacy to Sdn and my

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,670
question for you is which one of those

00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:12,250
those transitions do you find to be the

00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:14,110
most challenging sort of or do you think

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,230
is the most important for you to make

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,600
and also which ones still are sort of

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,980
need more development from the industry

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,540
to enable you to be successful in that

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,430
transition great thank you very much

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,780
great question I'm getting a cue that

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,830
we're running out of time I will answer

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:31,210
briefly and be happy to discuss offline

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,250
from my perspective I think on the one

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,230
side the transition and that

00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,290
transformation will probably be longer

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,660
because that's a little bit a newer

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:43,150
technology and it is less established

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,190
and on the data center side so that will

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,200
be my short answer and I'll be happy to

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,730
discuss that offline with you thank you

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,080
very much all I think we're running out

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,980
of time do we have time for one more

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,280
question

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:58,660
one last question sure since the visa is

00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:03,310
a very important position to serve the

00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:06,000
commercial banks or credit clearance the

00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,000
open source software

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:12,970
versus a commercial software has a lot

00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:16,270
of things to be improved or qualified be

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:19,299
inside into the visa network do you see

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,640
any differences between how do you

00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:23,710
qualify the process I mean how do you

00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,950
qualify the open-source versus qualify

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,600
Oh commercial software yes I will

00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,659
provide a short answer and we'll be

00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,419
happy to discuss offline I personally

00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:36,880
believe that open-source today can

00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:38,980
actually provide a great level of

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,159
robustness in terms of the quality of

00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,960
the code as well as good as a commercial

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,880
piece of hardware because there is the

00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,580
whole community involved and within visa

00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,169
we have a very well-defined process to

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:55,120
operationalize new technologies

00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:58,809
including open source so in my opinion

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,370
both types of code can work equally well

00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:02,260
in a mission-critical environment

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,809
whether it's open source based or kind

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:07,270
of the commercial-grade code if I

00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:10,450
understood correctly your question thank

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:13,799
you sure thank you very much thanks

00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,799
