	Tutorial: Getting Started with NFV Testing - Trevor Cooper, Intel & Jose Lausuch, Ericsson

A key tenant of moving NFV from a Proof of Concept (Poc) to deployment is testing. NFV solutions that pull from open source projects such as OPNFV, OpenStack, OpenDaylight, and others must be integrated and tested in an environment that fully supports the performance and availability requirements of service provider networks. Testing criteria and solutions are also required to ensure NFV interoperability between hardware and software systems that comprise NFV. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn best practices for open source NFV testing, including: methodology; mapping to ETSI NFV use-case/s; open source project integration; testing dashboards; Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD); and testing acceleration.

About Trevor Cooper
My current role at Intel is as an architect in the Data Center Network Solutions Group. I have been involved in OPNFV from the start, initially as PTL for the Pharos lab infrastructure project. I am currently PTL of an NFVI performance testing project and help lead the OPNFV test community.

About Jose A. Lausuch
Jose Lausuch is a telecommunications engineer, working as a Senior Systems Designer at Ericsson in Germany. He has been mainly focusing on designing, developing and integrating cloud systems and infrastructures in the NFVI area. | He is actively contributing to OPNFV since March 2015, currently holding the PTL role in the Functional Testing project (Functest) and active in other areas such as CI, Infra and testing.
