thank you so much thank you good morning

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,320
everybody

00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,880
so as our pet said we're gonna take it

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,940
up a level a little bit you may be

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,070
thinking what is a KPMG guy and audit

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,859
tax professional services firm doing at

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:24,900
an open networking summit so my

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:27,680
background I recently led Dells

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,960
networking converge infrastructure

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,660
solutions business when delat acquired

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
force 10 from a networking standpoint

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,260
and we created and despite in leaf

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,210
architectures and Kevin shot schemer and

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,890
and some my ex colleagues Adele they'll

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,440
be up here for the Intel talking about

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,260
that before that I was with Huawei 3com

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,559
which was h3c and Huawei is going to be

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,110
coming up after me and then before that

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,199
was around if I'm going to dating myself

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,199
was cable Tron systems and and bunch of

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,440
fitty SONET you know work that we've

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,080
been doing hence hence the gray beard so

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,360
we we thought we will you know take it

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,159
up a level and help you connect the dots

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,560
of if we're talking about an open

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,630
networking ecosystem how does that open

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,150
networking ecosystem connect to the

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,100
c-suite meaning that if the world is

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,200
moving to cloud and that doesn't mean

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,540
just public clouds or you know telcos

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,320
you know providing MPLS in the cloud but

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,000
applications that are moving into the

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,259
cloud so if you look at Salesforce so

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,180
you look at workday or service now

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,420
what's the role of the network and how

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,829
do you make the network relevant to the

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,640
c-suite so that's what I'm going to

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,700
cover in the next 19 minutes with you

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,350
just a quick one one pager on what KPMG

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,840
is so KPMG you know in about 150 plus

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,549
countries 200,000 people and all

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,729
professionals who provide advice to

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,100
clients on how to take their their

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,530
businesses and digitally transform them

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,240
and align them to their clients new

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,310
customer experiences so if you're a

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,340
retailer or if your bank or if your

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,500
telco you have customers and how do you

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,000
provide those new solutions to the

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,270
customers and how do you take technology

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,920
and you align that to the customers the

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,080
services we provide you can see our

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,750
digital customer experiences around data

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,100
analytics cybersecurity people in change

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,290
I don't know how many if you believe

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,990
that you know if if you have to go

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,450
through a new technology adoption and

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,490
the business in the business that it's

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,350
easy you really do need to drive a full

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,290
change management and a people and

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,090
change and a culture aspect before you

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,820
you were able to actually successfully

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,970
deploy technology making a difference we

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,250
spend over 500,000 hours globally the

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,610
the stat I loved the most and I can see

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,860
this room is is not aligned to the stat

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,340
which is globally out of our 200,000

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,540
people we have 47% females that work at

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,769
KPMG so that's a huge huge difference

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,540
than this room or the networking

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,850
industry because having that

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,680
differentiation really helps us innovate

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,590
a lot faster to have diversity of

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,360
thought but then also you know the top

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,690
six cloud providers the telecom

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,760
providers we partner with because if the

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,620
OEMs are not coming on the open source

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,600
bandwagon guess what the system

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,150
integrators and consulting firms are

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,590
right there with you and helping drive

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,660
that transformation and you're seeing

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,850
many of the system integrators and

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,130
you're seeing many of the consulting

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,769
firms now come in and work with the

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,200
clients I think yesterday the founder of

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,390
you know I think onf was highlighting

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,239
that there's still a challenge with the

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,829
big ole AMS not the big om networking

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,650
companies adopting open networking

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,450
solutions and and that's why system

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,410
integrators are more important okay so

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,620
let's get into it

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,790
if you look at the age we all talk about

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,470
you know the Second Industrial

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,230
Revolution or third Industrial

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,900
Revolution I like to talk about the age

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,489
of customer experience so bear with me

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,500
for a bit because I think it's important

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,049
for all of you networking professionals

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,910
who are working on disrupting the norms

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,459
of the networking industry and moving

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,290
towards and you know Linux base or open

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,480
source based solutions I think it's

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,130
important for you to understand in 2019

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,840
that majority of the clients that you

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,810
know I advise the c-suite

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,270
the CEOs the chief digital officer is

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,150
achieve supply chain officers even the

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,750
chairman of the board the number one

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,900
challenge

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,100
that they're grappling with right now is

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,350
well how am I going to serve my own

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,070
customers because my own customers is

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,770
changing

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,780
that's the Millennial set it's the gen Z

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,060
set you know people who come from India

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,170
and China to Canada in the US feel that

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,450
they have now come to the third world

00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,220
country if you if if they if they have

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,530
payment modernization if you look at

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,330
that it's it used to be a totally

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,970
different world and that customer

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,670
experience is going to change you know

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,280
the way my 19 year old son is going to

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,110
you know buy insurance if does you

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,330
really know what the traditional

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,010
insurance companies look like versus

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,240
what Amazon and by the way Amazon

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,700
recently just filed to become an

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,100
insurance company in the UK so when that

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,790
happens it's the customer experience

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,440
that our clients are looking for so

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,900
think about this for a second what is

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,600
the network's role to provide customer

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,520
experiences should network still be

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,250
relegated down to the back office and an

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,890
IT function under a CTO under a CIO or

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,050
can network be that common denominator

00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,600
that actually connects to the customer

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,760
experiences so so I think I you're all

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,350
brilliant individuals and minds I think

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,750
you understand the slide so I don't

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,590
necessarily need to drain it but the key

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,479
point is we are not in just a age of

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,740
information or age of data we're

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,510
actually in the age of customer

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,370
experiences and these age of customer

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,040
experiences are driven by you know

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:56,070
multiple factors just quick bubbles

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,169
right how many billions of 2.5 billion

00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,610
Millennials in the world and you know

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,070
how many people coming out of middle

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,810
class in India and China and when you

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,560
look at when you look at the consumers

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,390
of of the products that our clients

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,250
develop doesn't matter if your cloud

00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,960
company doesn't matter if your telecom

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,010
doesn't matter if you're a retailer it

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,280
doesn't matter if you're an oil and

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:20,190
energy company you are moving in this

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,470
direction because of these factors and

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,229
you also are moving into this factor

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,750
because you know as human beings because

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,270
of you know social and apps and

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,979
everything as a service we delete apps

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,350
how many of you have downloaded an app

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:37,560
and deleted it after using it for the

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,090
first time come on this has to be higher

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,099
than that

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,450
so it's 75 percent of the room right so

00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,910
now

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,830
but if your business becomes an app

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,360
which it is becoming if you're an

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,400
insurance company or if your financial

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,960
company you know how many times you

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,240
actually go into your retail bank versus

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,330
having it on your phone now if a

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,820
millennial or a Gen Z or even somebody

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,010
who's sandwiched between a baby boomer

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,480
and a millennial that's me I don't think

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,100
anyone will ever remember this

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,170
generation that Ike that I'm that I

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:11,390
represent is-is-is is deleting

00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:13,580
businesses and that's why SNP 500 is

00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,680
changing it use the S&P 500 the

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,130
companies that were listed on S&P 500

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,530
used to last almost 60 years back 50

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,320
years ago now in an average S&P 500

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,390
company last for 11 to 12 years as an

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,280
SMP 500 company because someone comes in

00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,380
and disrupts them and those are major

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,260
reasons that they get disrupted because

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,240
you know you're you're spending money in

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,210
a different way people and clients are

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,640
consuming different ways so why how does

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,470
all of this connect to the network if

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,040
you look at the disruption from the top

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,750
how many of the CEOs 38% of the CEOs say

00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,790
that they need to reposition their

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,070
business what that means in English is

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,470
that they're trying to reposition their

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,690
business to move in this direction of

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,600
providing new experiences to their

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,820
clients or to their customers you can

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,860
see almost the third of the CEOs are

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,800
aren't personally ready to lead the

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,230
radical changes so they're hiring KPMG's

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,770
and other consulting firms to help them

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:15,310
transition guess who Microsoft Azure

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:19,430
spends the most time with these days

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:21,110
guess who GCP or ally cloud or others

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,240
they're spending more and more time with

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,160
consulting firms because we're going in

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,350
and helping drive a supply chain

00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,150
automation and if we drive a supply

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,700
chain automation and the result is that

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,710
it should be in the Azure cloud or it

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,080
should be going through this telco and

00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,120
I'll use an example for you that is

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,310
where it's no longer your three-tier

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,260
channel models it's directly going down

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,790
to the business c-suite and getting them

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,590
to understand that their business and

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,920
how their business should connect

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:51,410
through an ST when from an open MPLS

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,620
that's now up in the cloud and then

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,040
connecting it to an azure or GCP or AWS

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,960
or

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,090
you know Ali clouds and going through

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,820
telcos and operators in the middle and

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,850
what's their value for that so that is

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,040
really if I had to just have you take a

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,380
picture of one slide or remember one

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,060
slide this would be it and this is a

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,810
slide that me coming from the networking

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,570
industry

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:18,530
I had to personally understand and grasp

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:21,380
and that is that at the CEO level at the

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,150
board level they think of front middle

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,000
and back office they don't think about

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,100
you know our layer 2 layer 3 layer 4 all

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,750
the way up to the OSI layers of layer 7

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,460
they don't think about that I know

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,620
you're shocked they don't think about

00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,690
that they think about the front office

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,900
and the front office functions as they

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,640
think about this is really around their

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,560
sales teams their marketing teams their

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,150
retail operations or their customer

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,800
experiences their middle office they

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,930
think about their chief supply chain

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,820
officers and they think about their you

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,170
know operations of making processing and

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,180
delivering around supply chain in

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,390
procurement then they have a back-office

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,490
function now let's relate to everything

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,500
that you and I and we all understand and

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,860
I put these logos there because these

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,000
logos have one thing in common

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,280
everything that they deploy for these

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,560
business functions is all in the cloud

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,110
right so if you start with the front

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,750
office what does the sales teams all

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,240
want oh salesforce.com or Microsoft

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,760
Dynamics or they're providing new CX UX

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,650
design using Adobe all of these

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,020
functions used to reside on a data

00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,060
center as an application that you needed

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,060
a network to connect it's now all in the

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,040
cloud and they're spending billions of

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,320
dollars have hiring consulting firms to

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,180
deploy this right then you look at the

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,820
middle office middle office used to be

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,380
deployed on a traditional JD Edwards or

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,270
traditional PeopleSoft ply

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,370
platforms or even s AP and Oracle's

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,750
that's not moving to ServiceNow or now

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,060
Ana plan just went public

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,220
right so ServiceNow and Ana plan all in

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,840
the cloud right it's it's like the

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,580
salesforce.com versions of those and

00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,350
then you go to the back-office and

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,180
what's happening in the back office is

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,840
traditional applications of your file

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:02,150
print email and other non enterprise ERP

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,360
applications are also being moved to the

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,340
cloud by loads so if I showed you all of

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,510
these logos and said if these are all of

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,400
those logos

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,160
of companies that these business units

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,080
really care about you know they don't

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,270
really care about the traditional OEMs

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,820
that we would think of and-and-and the

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,680
traditional OEMs be a Juniper biet Cisco

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,080
or Dell networking or HP Networking and

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,730
others they are residing underneath that

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,880
infrastructure and they have to somehow

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:32,000
connect to these applications and up

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,340
move up to the c-suite so in order to

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,340
move up to the c-suite what is the role

00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,770
of the c-suite and personally coming

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,200
from again the networking industry

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,930
I had to personally unlearn some

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,750
behaviors myself as a human being and

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:51,560
learn some new skill sets to understand

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,270
what is it that the CEO wants from the

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,670
network rather than just cutting a pair

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,770
cutting op X and a capex check to the

00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,870
CIO or the CTO and what's that

00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,180
connection point and I think my

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,280
colleague from AT&T and Ericsson talked

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,500
about this with with the video that they

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,900
showed but but it's hard for us to

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,150
connect the dots from the role of the

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,770
CEO to the chief finance officer to the

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,680
chief marketing officer and others and I

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,150
spend a lot of time with the c-suite and

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,230
when I ask them and I tell them oh I you

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,030
know I come from the networking industry

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,710
they usually ask what are you doing here

00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,750
you know you come from the networking

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,490
industry and how does the networking how

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,630
does the network relate to this and and

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,390
I think it's important for them to

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,580
understand the network plays a very very

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,310
very critical role and especially an

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,680
open network that is able to work across

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,870
all of these applications is an

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,730
important aspect of it so I wanted to

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,530
show you this because you can read these

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,360
all yourself in terms of what does the

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,910
chief digital officer care about what is

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,950
that CIO or the chief technology officer

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,840
care about what is the chief supply

00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,430
chain officer or the chief operating

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,590
officer from an Operations perspective

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,360
care about those things as you're

00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,490
developing your new products and an open

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,830
source environments I would say think

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,350
about that more more because that is the

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,360
relevancy you need to create and not

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,650
just the traditional ways of you know

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,530
providing a network infrastructure

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,880
because client deployed more and more

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,760
data center I just came from a very

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:18,560
large CEO of of the largest automotive

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,810
rental company and they've just made the

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,130
decision to move every workload in every

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,930
application to the cloud

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,630
and he said why would I still need to

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:30,350
buy networking you know to to deploy on

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:32,089
premise and reality was that they hadn't

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,850
thought through the rise of edge

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:37,250
computing and IOT sensors and what are

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,139
those going to be in their new work in

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,910
their new world order not just the

00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:43,459
traditional applications that sit on the

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,740
data center so so I think we all know

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:48,709
and I think everybody has geeked out on

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,250
all of these points around NF we -

00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:55,670
containers - you know internet versus

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:59,269
MPLS - mobility and automation and all

00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,670
of these have significant impacts and

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:04,190
they drive increased complexity to

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,959
manage and operate in an ever-changing

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,230
environment I think you all understand

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:11,449
that because more more of these come on

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:14,839
they simplify that and if you are you

00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:17,389
know AWS or GCP or you know alley cloud

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,399
or you know any of the six big public

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,709
cloud vendors your pitch is that this

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,600
all gets simplified if you move your

00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:26,089
workloads to the cloud and I think the

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,579
key here is really that the world is not

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,470
as simple the world comes in three

00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,529
different flavors right so the first

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,540
flavor of the client you go see is you

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:37,310
know I'm a private cloud I have my still

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,199
my data centers and bunch of people who

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,449
are hugging compute and storage and

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,670
networking technologies and and they

00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:45,620
either burst out to the public cloud or

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,240
they have applications and and then they

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,970
have their internet access so that's

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,430
client number one it's that I'm seeing

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,170
that personally change more and more the

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,670
second one is you know we've made the

00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,990
decision like that automotive car

00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,370
company that I just told you about that

00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,990
everything is going to the cloud and

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,790
we're not going to have an on-premise

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,589
data center so why are you even talking

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,170
to me about networking or open

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:08,240
networking why do I need that I can go

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,100
to my telco and the telco can abstract

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,899
MPLS and put it in the cloud and they

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,880
can start working towards even other

00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,290
protocols of routing and switching

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,120
because you know the bandwidth that

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,490
you're getting from AWS is much much

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,029
larger than that so that's that point

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,889
and then there is this reality which the

00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,420
clients who go to public and then come

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,920
back and bring their workloads to

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,430
on-premise because they know that not

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:35,000
all workloads work work well in public

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,980
that there is this world of SAS there

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,900
this world of public and there's this

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,820
world of on-premise data center in a

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,000
containerized as a service environments

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,040
I as the world of Internet and finally

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,110
the word world that is going to be even

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,600
bigger than then traditional cloud which

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,540
is the rise of edge computing and and

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,430
how does IOT sensors play a role and the

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,340
clients who are maturing and the clients

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:01,100
that we advise that KPMG is really about

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,470
this entire right hand of this slide

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,970
right which is how do you look at your

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,550
traditional applications not by

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,830
workloads by the c-suite applications

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,710
that I showed you for front middle and

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:15,320
back office and how do you connect your

00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,180
cloud solutions to that right so you're

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,480
going all in cloud is one thing but then

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,540
having a multi tier environment on how

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,630
you abstract different protocols and

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,180
layers for specific applications and if

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,620
an OEM which is your traditional network

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,410
provider who's still coming in and

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,630
seeing every nail is a switch hammer or

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:39,860
a routing hammer or every nail is a

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:41,870
white box with this you know with a

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,390
linux based solution on it that's not

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,100
the answer the answer is really what is

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,770
the application and then work it down

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,800
and say how can network play an active

00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:55,130
and important role so you know that's

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,260
where we advise a lot of clients that

00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,610
saying hey you know it's not just open

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,410
networking and it's not just traditional

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,750
networking it's really these

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,750
self-driving networks so when you have I

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,870
just came from an oil and gas client as

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,300
well up in Calgary in Canada and you

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,189
know they have the second largest you

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,439
know oil outside of Saudi Arabia and and

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:17,240
and what they're driving towards is

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,010
really yeah you know they have wells

00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,350
everywhere and think about these wells

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,050
that they have you know human beings

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:26,270
driving to the wells and taking the bit

00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,220
out and checking the bit to see if that

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,300
bit is still functioning or not where

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,490
they're moving towards is putting

00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,520
sensors on those bits and they're you

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:37,130
know connecting you know mash networks

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,470
with LTE using telcos which which is

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,510
with my AT&T colleague talked about

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,460
they're moving towards that direction

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,760
and they're moving that towards that

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,970
direction so that 75% of the roles of

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,590
those you know

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,330
human beings who actually drive to those

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,039
wells to check won't be needed because

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,140
you will move into a proactive

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,179
environment you won't be in a reactive

00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,900
environment and the role of a

00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:03,570
self-driving Network becomes with all of

00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,510
those sensors intelligence so its

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,620
intelligence driven to makes predictions

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:10,080
decisions automatically so you don't

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,419
need a network guy or gal who's going

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,919
out and and operating that for you it's

00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:17,510
analytics driven so that you can

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,770
actually say this is the you know ideal

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,630
percentage and Ericsson has a great demo

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,580
that I was looking at last night where

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,250
they actually show you this machine

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,919
learning as an actual demo of a network

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,659
being config configured and actually

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,549
highlight that for you and then you look

00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:34,470
at purpose-driven which is networks

00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:36,690
that's aligned to business purpose and

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,190
then finally you know it's it's also

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,289
thinking through you know the security

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,590
aspects now you go and have that

00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:46,470
conversation and connect it to that oil

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:49,049
and gas or the well or or or an

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,429
insurance company value proposition now

00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:53,340
you've got the attention of the c-suite

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:56,220
because you're no longer talking about

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,140
the back-office cio traditional CTO

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,299
function you're actually up leveling it

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,309
and you're connecting it so the practice

00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:04,530
that at KPMG we talked about a lot with

00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:07,080
our CIOs and CTOs is is that how to

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,909
connect the value proposition of you not

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,409
just lowering your capex and OPEX but

00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:12,929
actually connecting it to the business

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:16,080
function and helping you understand that

00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:18,630
so a self-driving network is really you

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,490
know it's in these four phases that we

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,580
consult with a lot of those CEOs and we

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,380
say you know telcos and cloud are

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,240
optionally graded greater at customer

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,059
service and flexibility and you use

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,280
telco and cloud as optionality that's

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:34,980
the difference hybrid cloud IT

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,690
environments that is automated fully

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,549
integrated security architectures and

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,950
all attacks and capex right so of course

00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:43,500
we know all of those discussions but if

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,740
I use this the last two slides to to

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,210
wrap up my my talk is I'll use an

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,480
example of a very large insurance

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,010
company their problem and I'll tell you

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,039
how that connects to the network their

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,899
problem started with they had a current

00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,700
network state and they had a cloud ready

00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:01,570
environments and others but their

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,480
problem was in their middle office

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,220
with actuarial data I don't know how

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,500
many of you know about actuarial data of

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,850
worked with actuarial sciences I don't

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,190
think this room whatever I would have

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,620
but think about people who actually work

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,560
on that and at the month at the month

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:21,040
end they had fragmented data between the

00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,420
US Canada Asia and Europe and they

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,530
couldn't fragment that data and they had

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,150
to spin some servers an IBM data center

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,280
that they had outsourced about you know

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,990
six seven hundred of them and they would

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,550
only use it for five or six days at the

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,270
end of the year at the end of the month

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:38,680
but they won't really connect it to you

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,690
know to their actuarial data they just

00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,730
said the CIO or the CTO will handle that

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,530
first they had to take the fragmentation

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,210
of that actuarial sciences and

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,340
understand exactly what that data

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:52,180
insight was and then they had to make a

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:55,360
decision to use a telco to say am i able

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,790
to take that data using an MPLS that's

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,680
that's now in the cloud along with some

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,630
others that are confidential that went

00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,910
to the cloud and then they connected it

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,280
to Microsoft Azure and that became the

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,230
number one spinning workload in

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,110
Microsoft Azure and it started with

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:14,020
actuarial data it did not it did not

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,520
start with here's my cough as your value

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,770
proposition or here is the telecom

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,990
providers value proposition for MPLS it

00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,840
started with actuarial data so you know

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,810
having the fragmentation solved at

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,180
different layers is is key and I'll end

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,400
with this and I'll say in order for you

00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,800
to think about this with your clients or

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,480
even as you are thinking about

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,280
developing your offers and open

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,900
networking offers think about the the

00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,970
for journeys the one number one is

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,740
understand the network's role in the

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,030
industry specific to digital

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,700
transformation or digital disruption

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:48,580
right so what's that role point number

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,500
one point number two is creating a

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,020
strategy where customer experiences are

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,610
central I started up with it's all about

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,470
the customer experiences I gave you some

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,020
examples of an insurance company or a

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,660
telecom company or an oil and gas

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,820
company number three is enterprise wide

00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,510
strategy that connects the front middle

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,150
back office the last time I checked

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,920
network is the connector of front middle

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,080
and back office but it doesn't get

00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,550
positioned that way and then finally a

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,960
culture change a probe

00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,630
through digital transformation that

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,210
culture change is the most important

00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,790
thing that is impeding growth and and

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,620
those those are the key key stakeholders

00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,640
on driving digital transformation so

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,990
thank you so much for your time I

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,559
appreciate it and have a great

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,900
conference

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,349
take care

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,349
