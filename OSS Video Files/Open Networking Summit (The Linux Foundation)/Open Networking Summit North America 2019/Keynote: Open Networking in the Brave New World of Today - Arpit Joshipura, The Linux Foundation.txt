please welcome to the stage general

00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,710
manager of networking at the Linux

00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:19,660
Foundation

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:23,410
Arpit joshua morning welcome i know

before we get started let's just walk

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,030
through a few logistics and and

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,949
housekeeping things nothing can happen

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,069
without our sponsors so thank you very

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:47,109
much - the diamond sponsor Ericsson

00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:49,569
Intel lean and a free and open

00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:51,519
networking foundation as well as our

00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:55,989
platinum sponsor Alibaba cloud and

00:00:51,519 --> 00:01:00,850
Huawei I would point out that the

00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:04,119
programming of this event has been even

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,009
harder than last year we had 5x

00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:09,280
the number of subscriptions or the

00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:12,130
submissions I should say and and these

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,369
fantastic people all kind of code nerds

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:19,060
and techies they had to sift through all

00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:20,890
the submissions and so a big thanks to

00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,450
the program committee for picking the

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,500
best content for you can we give them a

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:28,600
big round of applause please I'm

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,969
assuming they're all here but if not

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,869
just thank them then when you see these

00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:38,710
pictures okay also a few other

00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:40,420
announcements there's a schedule app if

00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,329
you may so please download it through

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:49,090
the QR code that'll be really helpful to

00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:51,310
get most of the sessions going if you

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,579
have not met people and would like to

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:58,060
meet people there's a networking app no

00:01:54,579 --> 00:02:00,219
pun intended in a networking conference

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,829
there's a networking app to network with

00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:05,859
people but you know who cares just do

00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:11,019
that it's been proven very useful in the

00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:13,599
past so please do that and we really

00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:15,130
love your feedback so every year I

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,950
personally go through the feed

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,140
obviously the events team does you can

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,960
see slight changes we make you know

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,230
everybody wants this or that and we

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,030
listen to these feedback forms very very

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,840
carefully so please give us a feedback

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,150
on the sessions and and on everything

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,420
and then the way the the tracks are set

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,730
up there are five tracks as you know

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,790
from the from the schedule there's a

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:46,050
track on innovation so all the new stuff

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,670
what's going on there's a track on

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,400
service providers DevOps and cloud

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,860
what's happening there there's a track

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,140
on enterprise NIT from a networking

00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,260
perspective and then we added two new

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,970
tracks this this time there's an edge

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,920
track for the first time and we've

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,680
received some amazing content for that

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,530
and then there is a cloud native track

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,290
so there's cloud native networking right

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,100
how does cloud native come together so

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,090
please along with that there are two

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,950
unconference tracks so this is the first

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,480
time we are introducing something call

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,250
our conference what that means is you're

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,960
gonna bring you know if you have a topic

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,680
and their peers who want to discuss it

00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,860
mark it up you will have it published on

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,860
the schedule right it's like on-demand

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:36,430
speaking so please do that and with that

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:41,230
said let me start off by you know taking

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:46,780
a very very short overview in the open

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:50,290
networking brave new world of today it's

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:56,010
been about a year since we had this ons

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:58,209
last year right and we had three big

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,340
questions in front of us

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,680
people were saying uh but you can't do

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,920
this all but this is a problem oh but

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,500
this will not work right and so what I

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,520
thought today we would do is we will

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,340
bring in the context of that discussion

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,920
in what I call three myths in open

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,700
networking and I think we have debunked

00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,020
those three in one year and it's

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,080
important to note this is no small

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,510
achievement okay so let me go through

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,890
the three myths very quickly

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:34,270
and you will realize what I'm talking

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,640
about myth number one telecom service

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:40,420
providers a legacy of a hundred plus

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,300
years and so that's all that baggage is

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,750
going to prevent collaboration creation

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,780
and deployment of open networking that

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,400
was the big you know headlines years ago

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,590
right couple of years ago a year ago

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,030
well guess what happened now what

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,750
happened was we started with

00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:02,500
virtualization then came disaggregation

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:04,960
so Sdn NFV paved the way to start

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,640
thinking about the brave new open world

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:12,160
then came automation which led to

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,130
orchestration solutions incomplete open

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,780
source landscapes and and we are today

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,420
in the world of open collaboration

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,040
collaboration across multiple industries

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:27,580
multiple technologies right multiple

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,890
markets and and and so we're in a huge

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,530
journey and I'm not saying the first

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,020
step of the journey is not done yet or

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,790
we're just traversing different markets

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,010
are going at a different level let me

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,850
show you some proof points the

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:45,790
collaboration was huge we brought in

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,430
nine of the ten top open source projects

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,350
all in one entity we brought in

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,780
operators to come together and start

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,370
collaborating we had all the vendors

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,760
come in these are just some examples

00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:01,150
ampuls right that really pushed the

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,550
button right we did not leave any

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,710
networking vendor behind and I think

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,830
that's a big statement to make here on

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,020
this stage that's the collaboration once

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,510
you have collaboration and creation you

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,430
move to deployment and you have seen

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,070
multiple of these examples I won't even

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,410
go through this right and on what some

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,610
of the big carriers small carriers some

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,320
of them we don't even know what they

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,580
have deployed right so it's it's just

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,530
happening as we speak

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,720
there are challenges but people are

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,880
moving past those challenges right so

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,300
the collaboration and creation have led

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,360
to major automation and they all want to

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,420
do that because algae is coming or has

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,820
come depending on your perspective and

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,650
then on top of that

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,290
the impact of open networking is

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,160
completely global and when we see

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:52,680
diversity diversity across people

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:56,010
diversity across geography diversity

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,710
across companies that's a true mark of

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,300
open source if you look at projects on

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,110
the right-hand side these are just some

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,510
examples

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,820
you know the circles are just showing

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,550
release after release the colors keep

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,890
increasing right opendaylight for

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,190
example when it started to where it's

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:16,860
now very colourful right that means

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,230
multiple people have contributed it's

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,120
it's it's a steady state open source

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,600
project there's productize and deployed

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:29,190
so we're feeling very excited to drive

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:31,170
this level of open source and where we

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,420
need to do is do a couple of

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,890
announcements obviously to take this to

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,380
the final frontier

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,440
so the first announcement I think will

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,120
be put out is in a year mark with a left

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,750
networking which is the umbrella that is

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,310
hosting some of this we are announcing

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,910
what we call people certification right

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:53,610
so there's a deep onap training

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,620
certification we're including several

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,170
e-learning courses where you can put

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,960
your operations staff your network

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:03,270
admins who need to be trained on next

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,820
generation of open source courses are

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,410
available certification is available

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,510
there's a commercial certification and

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:13,910
an ecosystem that goes along that to

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:18,780
become a certified provider and and and

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:20,910
along with that there's a huge industry

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:26,760
that needs to come together which is

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:29,040
across NF VI vim manner and vnf and what

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,080
we are really excited to announce is an

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,599
o VP program which is a compliance and

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,180
verification program that brings and

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,780
expands the interoperability and the

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,300
deployment challenge okay there's a lot

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,310
more detail in the sessions on this but

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,240
this announcement is really exciting it

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:50,460
wraps up the final two stages of you

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,340
know full-scale deployment so we're

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,620
excited about that so don't tell us that

00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,240
we cannot collaborate create and

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,339
ploy right that's kind of the first myth

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,839
the second myth is standards and

00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:06,990
consortiums and open source will always

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,920
compete I hate to break it to the press

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:13,890
right who love writing about it but that

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,190
myth is definitely debunked and I'll

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:20,460
show you why we started off with a an

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,080
appeal to bring the two communities

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,850
together there were white papers

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,000
published there were governance changes

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,279
their collaboration entities we brought

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,480
the communities together to the credit

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,540
of pretty much all the stos very very

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,540
proactive in how they came up together

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,160
remember this line this is the open

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:46,560
source world on the left and the open

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:49,470
standards world and let me tell you only

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,950
at our nest will you see a keyboard

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:56,520
panel which is so star-studded this is a

00:09:52,950 --> 00:10:01,220
Friday keynote you have math tip 3 GPP

successfully we have collaborated ok and

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,600
then there's a detailed sessions session

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,390
where you know we'll all come together

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,520
so I'm just saying this is a very

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,800
important milestone in the history of

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,290
networking right and we're really

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,560
excited that so for that I want to give

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,550
a big round of applause to our standards

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,010
ecosystem and the open source community

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:30,450
can we just quick quickly thank them

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:33,209
thank you and paid but wait we're not

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:37,440
done that was a poor man's version of

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:39,390
Steve Jobs sorry I ran you might have

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,150
seen this announcement you know through

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,910
3gpp another you know standards sto type

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,850
in our organization we just announced

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,230
the creation of a software community the

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,450
software community is going to come

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,230
together and collaborate and build

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,230
software and that software is not just

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,209
for Aaron but it is also for

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,029
collaboration across the ecosystem to

00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:05,940
give an end-to-end perspective of the

00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:08,400
entire telecommunication stack so really

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,570
excited about this and you know feel

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,230
free to attend several

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:16,620
sessions on this as well okay finally

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,230
myth number three and this is a little

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:23,820
bit complicated but I will start by

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:27,060
saying that the myth was that every

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:31,920
technology or a market whether it's

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:35,100
cloud enterprise telecom or technologies

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,420
like agile ta I at all these things will

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:42,480
never be brought together okay that's

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,930
not true right we started off with edge

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,090
we brought IOT cloud enterprise and

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,640
telcos together and something called LF

00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:55,050
edge it was a huge collaborative effort

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:58,020
from the community and then what we are

00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,060
announcing today is the continued

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,430
momentum there are more blueprints as

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,100
people come together to give out edge

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,130
solutions optimized for their market

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,020
there are amazing projects that you all

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:14,520
need to be participating and there are

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:16,500
consortiums right like Etsy IIC ACC this

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,570
is the automotive edge we are

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,360
collaborating and we are starting off

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:24,530
day one by putting it all together so

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,400
with that I'm going to summarize and say

00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:31,860
all the three myths collaboration

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,040
creation SDOs and marketing technologies

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,920
were happy to report that we have

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,200
demystified it now on the third one I'm

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,450
going to come back and give you some

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,850
more directional guidance in my closing

00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,220

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,500
