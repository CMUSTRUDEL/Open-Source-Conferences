	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
good morning what a nice conference this

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,250
open networking summit there is so much

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,690
energy and enthusiasm it's infectious I

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,099
look forward to coming here because I

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,920
learn so much every year so are we ready

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:21,180
for 5g and edge clouds well we better be

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,740
because 5g is ready for us so on a more

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,720
serious note what I actually wanted to

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,140
do today was to talk about our journey

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,359
through network transformation and in

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,460
particular talk about some challenges

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,890
that lay ahead of us as we look at the

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:40,170
5g transformation and maybe even suggest

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,540
a few things that we can do together as

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,640
a community to solve some of those

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,890
challenges before I start though I won't

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,059
actually talk a little bit about our

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,480
journey through network virtualization

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,370
network transformation bringing the data

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,530
center economics to the network

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,440
infrastructure and boy have you made

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,090
really good progress if you look at this

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,460
end-to-end picture of network

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,470
infrastructure we have great proof

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,140
points all over we have applications

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,200
such as virtual CPE and virtual SD van

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,659
in the enterprise network we have

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,990
virtual evolved packet pour EPC and ims

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,030
in the wireless core in the IT cloud we

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,210
have virtual security appliances load

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,070
balancers firewalls and even radio

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,890
access network which was actually always

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,049
thought of as difficult to virtualize we

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,600
are actually seeing some field trials

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,970
and early deployments for the virtual

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,540
ran and cloud ran kind of deployments

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,720
now all this actually sets up really

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,270
nicely for 5g because with FRA G what we

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,009
really want is a programmable and

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,490
scalable network infrastructure with 5g

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:56,040
actually what 5g delivers is 10 times or

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,950
more higher bandwidth 10 times lower

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,049
latency new paradigms new technologies

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,630
such as network slicing which deliver

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,430
end-to-end quality of service and even

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,290
the use of unlicensed spectrum which

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,879
allows us to actually penetrate deep

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,530
into the enterprises and so 5g I think

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,810
you're hearing a lot about it

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,020
it's actually going to transform how we

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,480
live now of course with 5g there is

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,360
always a discussion about edge and so

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,790
what is this mythical edge I like to

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,670
think about edge in very simple terms to

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,310
me it's really bringing cloud closer to

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,090
where the data is where the applications

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,950
are because the location matters as you

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,810
look at the next set of innovative

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,530
applications autonomous driving

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,050
industrial control real-time video 360

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,730
video video analytics the

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,980
decision-making that needs to happen

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,260
cannot tolerate a transaction that goes

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,590
all the way into the cloud and so I

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,780
think what I'm actually seeing is

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,040
discussion around a three tiered

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,410
hierarchy so traditionally we have

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,670
thought of client-server model but now I

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,530
think we have to look at distributed

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,410
applications and how do we actually

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,060
really attract the cloud developers to

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,620
come and actually build applications at

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,860
the network edge so Intel actually has

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,420
been a pioneer in our 5g contributions

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,970
so we've actually been a part of

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,790
standards definition and development for

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,470
5g and over the last couple of years I

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,510
think you probably saw it at the Winter

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,640
Olympics in Korea as well we've been

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,810
actually driving a number of field

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,850
trials in fact I think we have done

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,100
100-plus field trials over the last

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,010
couple of years and so later this year

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,320
when 5g begins to roll out it's actually

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:44,850
good to be powered by Intel in large

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:49,470
measure if you look at some of the key

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,690
requirements of 5g its performance is

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,040
definitely key but I like to think of

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,680
this as the workload optimized

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,150
performance to me actually Phi G is the

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,840
intersection of compute and

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,459
communications and all of the artificial

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,769
intelligence and analytics and that's

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,630
why the importance for how do we

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,260
actually have efficient compute married

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,750
with the network side of things second

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,289
quality of service it's actually all

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,900
about fine grained quality of service

00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:21,299
for the next wave of innovative

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,740
applications at the edge third as we

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,590
distribute the applications as we

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,910
distribute the data to the edge security

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,120
and trust models are

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,790
and then the whole discussion around

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,890
cloud ready and cloud native software I

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,990
think if you have to attract the next

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,550
generation of developers these are cloud

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,190
developers and we want to actually

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,890
provide that easy button for them so

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,700
they can actually think about will bring

00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,710
those innovations to the network edge

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,710
now I often get asked actually hey you

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,790
know what are some of the key tenants of

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,610
how do we evolve the network

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,170
infrastructure and from my perspective I

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,720
actually like to capture everything on a

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:05,100
single file so this is my attempt at how

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,350
I look at things first its scale up with

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,940
all this data they talk about workload

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,680
optimize performance

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,500
our goal has been how do we actually

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,850
drive a standard server to become a

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,040
best-in-class network infrastructure

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,020
server that's quite simply what I have

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,240
been driving at Intel that's what Intel

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,430
stands for and so as a result what you

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,590
actually see is the evolution of

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,800
standard server architecture with new

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,300
instructions new kinds of accelerators

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,700
that actually convert a standard server

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,680
and bring together this computing

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,750
communications into a standard

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,050
high-volume server platform scale up

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,780
scale out the vision here really needs

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,630
to be how do we drive how do we look at

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,640
the infrastructure as pools of compute

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,370
pools of storage pools of networking

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,260
pools of accelerators moons of memory

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,090
and how do we actually get to a point

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,190
where we can compose an application or a

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,940
service by drawing resources out of that

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,530
resource pool and then the last one here

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,440
is very important as well this is

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,810
orchestration automation and we have

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,330
actually talked about this this morning

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,850
there's a lot going on with automation

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,380
with the work that we have done with

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,540
OpenStack and kubernetes and also

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,010
working with VMware and then at the

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,020
service orchestration level with own app

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:24,720
but I believe actually still there is

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:27,090
more work to be done here so so far I've

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,830
actually talked about our progress with

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,540
network virtualization bringing the data

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,980
center economics to the network

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,680
infrastructure and the progress that we

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,300
are made there but I said that there are

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,270
actually challenges particularly as we

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,330
look at 5g transition deployment of edge

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,879
clouds

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:46,150
and when I talk to the community when I

00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,949
talk to all of you guys I hear three

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,120
consistent themes and actually wanted to

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,310
spend a little bit of time talking about

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,590
that and then what can we do about this

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,629
so first cloud native applications and

00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,039
there is a lot of discussion around how

00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,870
cloud natives sort of like immediately

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,879
gravitates towards a container

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,860
microservices approach but to me

00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,810
actually it's a lot simpler than that to

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,810
me cloud native is all about how do we

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:10,090
drive hardware abstraction device

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,250
abstraction and how do we actually allow

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,159
for workloads and applications to move

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,990
around in the cloud second Network

00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:20,770
automation there's been a lot of talk

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:24,180
about network automation to me actually

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,500
if you want to create the self-reliant

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,750
self-organizing self-correcting networks

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,650
we have to get to a point where we can

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,150
apply AI as a key element of how we

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,030
drive closed-loop automation and I will

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:40,870
talk about that third ed services I

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:44,080
talked about how it is important that we

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:46,349
attract the cloud developers and so to

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,000
me actually it's about how do we drive

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:52,120
provide that easy button for those

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,250
developers to build standards compliant

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,440
with standard interfaces edge

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,569
applications so let me actually talk

00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,949
about each one of these and what we are

00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,949
doing here and how the community can

00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:05,830
help first the cloud native network

00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,419
functions we've been on this journey

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,340
with like you know we started with fixed

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,199
functions Intel's being a pioneer in

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,580
this and we've actually helped migrate

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,949
to general purpose platform with

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,169
workload optimizations along the way we

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,430
actually built DP DK we pulled out in

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,469
the open source community and it's

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,240
become a standard now for how you

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,639
actually do high-performance data plane

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,779
on standard servers and we are at

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,639
virtual network functions in this

00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:32,199
journey and it's great progress but

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,709
along the way we have actually made some

00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:37,959
choices that depend on the hardware like

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:40,479
single to tayo virtualization sr io v as

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,640
an example that actually prevents you

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,140
from achieving the cloud scale and the

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,230
flexibility to move things around in the

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,040
cloud and so we really need to get to

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,180
this last step of how do we get to

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,480
eliminate those hardware dependencies

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,670
yet

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,070
we knew that in a fashion where you can

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,420
still achieve the performance and make

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,980
use of the capabilities of next

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,840
generation hardware so that's the whole

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,150
discussion around cloud native ENS and

00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,180
what this allows us to do is to do the

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,230
device abstraction and the decomposition

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,880
of applications into micro services and

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,410
overlays and fabrics and so on and so I

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,120
won't actually talk about what we are

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,270
doing or what we have done so far and

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,050
how we can actually evolve this to sort

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:26,570
of like achieve the full potential of

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,660
driving to a cloud scale data path so

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,630
first like I said DP DK it continues to

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,190
improve performance we deliver about 40

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,560
million packets per second for pour

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,690
which if you think about it on the

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,060
latest generation Z on platforms it is

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,840
600 gigabits per second of throughput on

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:47,480
a to socket Z on platform what we are

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,030
trying to do now is to evolve DP DK with

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,580
device abstraction so what that simply

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,670
means is we won't actually provide for

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,320
the applications to use accelerations

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,040
for crypto for machine learning for

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,280
baseband use of smart Nix but do it in a

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,260
way such that there is still a layer of

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,900
separation between the application and

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,390
the underlying devices or accelerators

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,920
that are being used and so we drive that

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,080
as we are driving that as a key thrust

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,540
in DB D came second thing what you see

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,100
here is a FX DP this is a new technology

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,200
I think somewhere some of you might have

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,350
heard about it X D P stands for Express

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,570
data path and it already exists as a

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,610
socket layer in the Linux kernel what

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,850
we're trying to do is all that learning

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,890
that we have from our work on DP DK we

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:38,570
won't actually bring it into a standard

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:41,120
Linux kernel networking stack and xdp

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,700
and the optimizations that we are doing

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,030
in terms of how the DP DQ style driver

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,710
and you know some of the learnings from

00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,890
DP DK that's actually going to actually

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,570
position us really well so my first call

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,520
to action here for you guys is if you

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,740
haven't actually looked at xdp I would

00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,020
like to call you to take a look at xdp

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,510
come talk to us so we can actually work

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,270
together to evolve x DP as the way to

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,140
sort of like drive a cloud native data

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,670
plane optimization

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:13,130
and of course we have a new technology

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,120
called application device queuing in our

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,520
standard NICs

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,030
Ethernet controllers that combines

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,850
nicely with a FX DP e to drive a low

00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,880
latency think of it as basically a

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:29,600
dedicated freeway Lane that allows you

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,160
to connect to containers or vnfs and

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,350
provides that low latency high

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:39,200
performance path second closed loop

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,000
automation to me this is actually

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,100
extremely important because this was a

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,530
key tenet of nfe that nfe was going to

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,540
deliver so things like fault detection

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,970
fault prediction dynamic resource

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,470
allocation demand prediction and

00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:56,060
automatic resource allocations

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,160
unfortunately this is one area that's

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,320
actually fallen behind and I like to

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,690
actually parse this as an engineer into

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,910
three areas first is actually real-time

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,530
telemetry we have actually tried to

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,030
address that problem by providing

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,070
real-time telemetry in a standard

00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,140
compliant way with a tool called collect

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:16,280
D o PMF he actually has the barometer

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:18,710
project the second area is orchestration

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,180
and I think we have made some progress

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,950
there Intel is actually a key

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,090
contributor to own app and onap is

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,940
actually doing a lot of work in this

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,700
area but in my mind what is missing is

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,240
the in-between part which is actually

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,130
how do we drive AI so how do we drive

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,400
trained models behind this real-time

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,520
telemetry that allows you to draw

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,780
real-time inferencing and close the loop

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,220
and so we have actually done some

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,220
prototypes of for applications such as

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,740
EPC and a cable modem termination system

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,300
and we are seeing actually great results

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,390
the results actually correlate within

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,810
two percent of what actually you do it's

00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,850
you know static policies and so my

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,830
second call to action is with respect to

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,720
closed loop automation would love to

00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,030
actually share what we have done and

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,770
really energize the community around

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,930
this and drive this with a sense of

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,970
urgency so we can actually drive get to

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,830
a closed loop automation and this would

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,540
actually be a heavy contributor to TCO

00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,910
and also actually realizing the full

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,970
potential of 5g networks

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:26,519
third the software easy button and I

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,800
realized is sort of like you know

00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,209
looking hearing the keynotes nobody

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,930
talked about this but this is going to

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:36,660
be very critical how do we provide that

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:38,640
you know standard compliant API set of

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,250
libraries that are optimized that the

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,200
cloud developers they just have that

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,450
easy button they say hey you know give

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,370
me a connection make it secure and we'll

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,110
actually they get that from the

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,459
infrastructure and so we have to

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,649
actually get to that point and what we

00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:55,890
have done here is at Mobile World

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:58,500
Congress we announced openness network

00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,390
edge services software and what this is

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,930
is a collection of libraries and

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,820
well-defined

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,620
api's that are compliant with Etsy Mac

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,410
and so if you haven't actually heard

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,320
about openness I would this is my third

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,880
call to action take a look at openness

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,070
we have some collateral at openness not

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,769
org what we're going to do is actually

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,209
put the software into open source at

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,070
zero one.org with a very light

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,660
governance and we'll see actually how

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,890
the community evolves around that and

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,930
then we'll figure out actually what we

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,670
want to do with it but like Intel always

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,810
does we actually like to lead with open

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,880
source and this is going to be an open

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,890
source and an example of how this works

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,350
in practice we have actually worked with

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:37,290
a key partner of ours Tencent I think

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,120
Robert is here in the audience so Intel

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,850
and Tencent actually work together to

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,160
drive a v2 ex blueprint in a Cray know

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,410
with some of the initial capabilities of

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,360
openness so the great example so this is

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,339
my other call to action come and talk to

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,899
us about openness and see what we can

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,690
actually do with it how we extend it and

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,399
how do we actually make it useful for

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,850
the next wave of for 5g enabled edge

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,440
applications so I talked about our

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,500
journey through network transformation

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,390
and so the challenges ahead of us what I

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,160
would like to do next is we've been

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,620
actually working very closely with the

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,490
Dell EMC so I would like to invite on

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,430
stage

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,050
Kevin shark amber a good friend is the

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,260
vp of enterprise and service provider

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,120
strategy and solutions Kevin we like to

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,249
come and share your perspective

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,249
[Music]

00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,680
Thanks so it's been a good morning for

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,300
me having an opportunity to listen to a

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,740
number of the presentations I think we

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,020
had Andre on this morning sharing an

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,120
operator perspective obviously art fit

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,950
came up this morning and shared and kind

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,350
of set the stage for for how the day

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,550
will go rajesh here having a great

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,380
conversation about some of the

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,510
technology evolution that's happening at

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,540
the server layer and inside of the

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:53,870
silicon of the server I think that our

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,270
mcgann from KPMG up this morning having

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,890
a conversation about the business side

00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,960
of this and how we're starting to see

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,700
the consulting and the business model

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,980
start to develop around the technologies

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,840
here and and I think that when we really

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,970
look at this and we use this term

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,590
digital transformation quite a bit I'm

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,780
going to pull the conversation up the

00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,880
upper level from where from where Rajesh

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:17,080
was from a technology perspective and

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,670
really recognize that we are talking

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,580
transformation right and I think that we

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:25,100
as an industry tend to think that the

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,100
problem space that were dressing is easy

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,840
I think we look at it and say that a lot

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,910
of the problems have been solved I think

00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,490
we look at it and say that there's a

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,990
homogeneous way to go solve the problems

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,240
that are in front of us there's a

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,730
homogeneous way to go solve the problems

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,050
that exist in simultaneously supporting

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:47,300
very very high bandwidth video and very

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:51,200
small packet size infrequent

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:54,590
communications over for IOT and sensors

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,570
and massively scaled high speed data

00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,910
communications with vehicles in motion

00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,280
that we can do this with one answer and

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,530
I think we tend to get lost in the fact

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,110
that the transformation that we're going

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,510
down is not a path to a single end

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,130
platform I think in in the world that

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,630
we've lived in before when we thought

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,790
about cloud and we thought about

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,430
massively scaled centralized data

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,380
centers homogeneity was the path to

00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,660
efficiency in this digital

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,550
transformation and as we move closer to

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,709
the edge the problem space is very

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,780
different it's not about deploying tens

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,300
of thousands of things at one location

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,460
it's about two pulling ones of things or

00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,130
tens of things at tens of thousands of

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,320
locations the operational problems and

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,220
challenges are different the technology

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,409
problems and

00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,470
challenges are different the logistical

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:45,370
problems are different so when we start

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:49,450
to think about the future of the edge I

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:52,700
encourage everyone to think about

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,470
heterogeneity as the new world that we

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,510
live in that how do we take

00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,820
heterogeneous technologies and

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,860
heterogeneous platforms how do we pull

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,020
from the best of open-source and the

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,230
best capabilities that exist inside of

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,480
vendor technologies how do we leverage

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,850
x86 architectures and smart Nix and GPUs

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,309
and merchants silicon and start to bring

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,169
them together in a common way and expose

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,150
them in a common way so that we can

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,370
start to put applications and services

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,409
and workloads on the right platform

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,419
leveraging the right capabilities at the

00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:25,070
infrastructure layer and I think that

00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,169
more and more over time when we think

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,909
about this this platform enablement and

00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:31,190
you probably see slides like this from

00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:34,280
just about everyone in the industry at

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,230
this point that this this IT OTC tea

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,980
convergence and the need to be able to

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:41,000
find a common way to modernize modernize

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,070
infrastructure abstract that

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,260
infrastructure build a software platform

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,510
on top of it that can that can be both

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,270
containerized as well as virtualized and

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:52,460
then transform applications themselves

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,890
to be able to support a cloud native

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,350
environment simultaneously to trying to

00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,620
adopt and adapt to a data-driven world

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,419
in which were leveraging AI as the

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,669
foundation for clothes move automation

00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:06,350
and trying to upskill a set of

00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:08,990
capabilities that exist within the

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,700
industry both at the vendor side as well

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,190
as the operational side that are so

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,990
rooted in a telco mindset I think that

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,090
the transfer transformational forces

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:20,270
that you see on the right really lead to

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,010
a very long path to get to where we want

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,659
to go now I think that the great part

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,490
about where we are is that we have proof

00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:27,830
points we saw the $0.10 proof point

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,390
Andrej doctor proof points today there's

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,610
a number of proof points that we

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,320
continue to demonstrate that we can get

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,789
there and I think that we're going to

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,110
continue to see a shift from

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:41,210
conversations at the abstract level to

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,460
more and more conversations at the true

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,039
execution level of demonstrating use

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,539
cases and I think we're Intel and LEM so

00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,039
you've really been partnered is on this

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,080
joint innovation not just with each

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,909
other but with the industry

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,140
open-source projects in our own CTO labs

00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:59,210
across multiple different lines of

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,100
business inside of the service provider

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:05,570
group inside of our artificial

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:08,179
intelligence solutions organization

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:10,340
inside of our ot solutions organization

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:12,559
and what I like about this slide is that

00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,779
it shows the continuity that exists

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,220
between edge and core and cloud and I

00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,559
think that the reason that's important

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,659
is a couple of fold number one I think

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,760
that as I said earlier the the cloud

00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:24,830
world has not solved all of the problems

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,899
that we can expect to see at the edge

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,409
world and they think that we very often

00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:32,750
tend to view ourselves as living in an

00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:33,139
either/or type of environment right do I

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,659
do

00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:39,409
containers or virtual machines do I you

00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:41,360
this x86 or FPGA or GPUs or smart NICs

00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,940
do I look at open source or do I look at

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,500
vendor proprietary technology and I

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,409
think more and more what we're tending

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,899
to see is a trend towards this closed

00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:53,630
loop here that says it's not an and it's

00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:54,830
not an or world we live in an end world

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,450
and we need to find the best

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,610
capabilities that exist within the

00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,889
industry we need to continue to evolve

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,000
at the infrastructure layer

00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:04,909
infrastructure evolution and innovation

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,470
is not data it's rose s just shared we

00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:08,120
need to find the best capabilities that

00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,919
exist at the software layer and pull

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,350
from open source projects and recognize

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,269
that even holistic open source projects

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:17,000
have bits and pieces that are really

00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:19,190
strong and areas where the open source

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,779
project is just not as strong and the

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,970
great thing about open source is that we

00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,340
can pull technology from multiple open

00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,649
source projects put them together in a

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,630
way operate them in a way that gives us

00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:31,460
the ability to really close this loop

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,679
and not think of the world there's an

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,269
either/or type of environment but an end

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,980
environment that brings together the

00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:39,380
best of what we've already learned and

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,269
motton in operating hyperscale public

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,950
cloud what we've already learned in

00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:44,389
operating private data centers and

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,389
starting to put and what we've learned

00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:49,700
in operating telco networks and start to

00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,799
put them together in a uniform way that

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,269
gives us the ability to really exploit

00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,620
the set of capabilities that we've been

00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:57,200
talking about all morning and that you

00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,580
see at this show floor so so with that I

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,010
wanted to I want to hand it back to

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,409
Rajesh to share a little bit more and

00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,310
then I think we'll kind of close out yes

00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:09,560
thank you

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:11,210
so before I summarize this has been a

00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,460
great week for Intel we actually made

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,440
several new announcements particularly

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,840
around our second generation Intel Xeon

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,550
scalable platforms what's special about

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,090
this is actually for the first time in

00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:26,870
our history we have announced Xeon - n n

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,580
4n Fe infrastructure so Zeon - n SKUs

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,230
which actually provide which are

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,080
fine-tuned optimized for network

00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,940
infrastructure and they provide up to 58

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,560
percent better performance as compared

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,380
to the first generation Xeon scalable

00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,170
processors the other thing about this

00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,580
platform is that all the 5g requirements

00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,800
I talked about workload optimized

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,350
performance quality of service cloud

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,670
native software and security there's a

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,650
lot of that that's implemented

00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,810
integrated with the Xeon scalable

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,330
second-generation platform we also

00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,460
announced a game-changing new memory

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,500
technology that offers a persistent mode

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:05,270
and reduce the total cost of ownership

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:07,220
by 34% as compared to DDR and then the

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,630
intelligent 800 series that I talked

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,300
about with technologies like application

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:15,620
device queuing and the next-generation

00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:17,180
FPGA Intel agile X so a great platform a

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,580
lot of new technologies that come into

00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:22,070
the market these are all actually

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:26,420
towards creating a best-in-class network

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:28,400
platform for the 5g networks so just a

00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,200
quick summary here so I think many

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,310
people have said this Phi G is here and

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,680
now

00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:36,230
Edge's at the epicenter of new services

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,530
and innovations my call to action is I

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,630
talked about three challenges and I

00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,370
suggested some ways of solving those I

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,350
would like to actually look to the

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,050
community to come collaborate work with

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,390
us and see how we actually address these

00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:54,110
challenges of course Intel is investing

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,430
5g from an end-to-end perspective and we

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,280
are committed to network transformation

00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,540
converting a standard server into a

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,460
best-in-class and network infrastructure

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,190
platform so let's collaborate and

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,080
realize the full potential of 5g Kevin

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,700
anything you'd like to add yeah I agree

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,530
a hundred percent here and I and I think

00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,690
that collaboration is really key right

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,010
this is so as if we start to think about

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,570
the world as a heterogeneous

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,700
infrastructure and a heterogeneous

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,639
software stack world I think that it's

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,799
important for us

00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:21,570
find the right ways to collaborate to be

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,119
able to progress this heterogeneous

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,399
environment without creating I think a

00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:28,379
stalling function in the industry right

00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:30,539
and I think that very often because we

00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:33,570
live in this or mentality and not an end

00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:36,149
mentality our leadership all the way up

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:38,099
through through the the c-suite at a lot

00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:40,289
of the a lot of the companies that I

00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:42,389
speak with and even sometimes inside of

00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:44,309
Dell and other companies kind of look at

00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:49,079
making technology decisions as a

00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:50,669
long-term and and binary decision and I

00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,249
think that we have to break that binary

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,749
decision and recognize that the only way

00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:56,369
to get to the end destination is

00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:58,619
actually to start moving and not be

00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:01,259
paralyzed by trying to make the right

00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,969
three-year five-year choice and instead

00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,539
collaborate as an industry to continue

00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:08,849
to evolve the entire ecosystem forward

00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:09,960
so with that thank you and have a

00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:14,349
wonderful awareness

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,349
