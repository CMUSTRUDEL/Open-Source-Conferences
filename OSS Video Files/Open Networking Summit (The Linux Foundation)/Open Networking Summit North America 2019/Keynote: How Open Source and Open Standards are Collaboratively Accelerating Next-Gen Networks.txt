Description: 
	Keynote: How Open Source and Open Standards are Collaboratively Accelerating Next-Gen Networks - Dan Pitt, MEF Forum; Axel Clauberg, TIP; Alla Goldner, 3GPP ETSI; Pierre Lynch, ETSI NFV ISG TST; Bill Carter, OCP; Pierre Gauthier, TM Forum; Phil Robb, LF

Standards bodies have been around almost as long as the telco industry itself. However, as open source has increasingly become a de facto approach to collaborative software development across sectors, the specific role of standards bodies vs open source communities can be complex. While standards should act as guidelines to keep technologies "open," especially for OSS developers, there's debate about what qualifies as open as well as who gets to pick what becomes a “standard.” This makes defining what “open standards” are - and how they integrate with open technologies themselves - more complicated. Representatives from both open software and open standards communities, will discuss how the two types of organizations work together to define and refine open source networking, as well as work together to change the way things operate based on lessons learned from the other party.

please welcome to the stage general

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,660
manager of networking at the Linux

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:14,780
Foundation

00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:19,740
Arpit joshi pura alright very good

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,539
welcome and I know you have survived the

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,269
onslaught of some deep technical

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,220
sessions over the last two days so

00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:27,930
really appreciate all the all the

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,060
feedback we have been receiving in terms

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,140
of the quality and and discussion so

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,410
thank you keep the feedback coming and

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,899
of course thank you to the folks on the

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,660
web sorry you can't meet people but you

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,640
know hundreds of you watching but of

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,300
course we're gonna save the best for

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,559
last right and and and today we have a

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,969
fantastic treat for you so I know a

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,430
couple of years three years ago we

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,219
started this journey on you know how do

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,920
how do standards and open-source

00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:06,540
collaborate and it is you know a rare

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,409
moment that we have collaboration that

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,770
is so vast that I have received an

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,140
exception on how the best practices of

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,580
panels are done right they normally tell

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,530
you don't don't put more than three or

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,130
four like we're going to run out of

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,080
chairs and we have two more standards

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,549
organization that we couldn't fit you

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,630
know we might have gone over fire code I

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:33,550
don't know but let's call on the stage

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,690
the amazing panel come on in

00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,790
[Music]

00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,790
[Applause]

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,980
[Music]

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,980
[Applause]

00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:51,830
all right and as they come in I want to

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,790
also say that you know we have Etsy zsm

00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,460
Klaus here we have Orrin again we can we

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:02,480
can just have a deep session here Phil

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,930
is our open source networking lead and

00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,030
he will be moderating the panel and I'll

00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,190
hand it to you but before we do that I

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,960
would say this is a historic moment this

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:17,300
is worth a picture right I mean look can

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,500
we get that slide over that shows the

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,690
pictures there you go look at that look

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,090
at who is represented and then you know

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,500
I think we have to thank ourselves we

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,720
have come a long way so give a big round

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:36,530
of applause to the panel and I'll hand

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,820
it over to Phil thanks Sara but good

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,430
morning everybody thank you very much

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,770
for joining us in this session

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,560
personally I can remember when in 2013

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,680
we started open daylight 2014 we started

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,300
Opie NFB and users started to ask the

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,610
question well gee if we're making all of

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,220
this software for our next generation of

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,830
platforms what is the role of standards

00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,020
with regard to that and that really

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,540
sparked a discussion or maybe some might

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,730
call it a debate on what that role was

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,920
and since both organizations are really

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,989
collaborative in nature by their

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,260
definition we started to try to work

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,510
together and as that began we recognized

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,550
pretty quickly that the governance of

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,100
these organizations are different how

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,510
you remember how you participate the way

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,030
you treat intellectual property is

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,580
different and even the whole development

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,950
ideology right of how you attack an

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,300
interoperability problem standards

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,580
typically look at things very

00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,590
holistically open source projects in

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,510
more of an agile fashion they kind of

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,760
fix the interoperability problem as they

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,380
hit it right so we had some pretty

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,060
significant hurdles when we started

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,390
trying to work together back in those

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,220
days but by what you see here on stage

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,020
we've actually overcome a lot of those

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,090
hurdles with different standards

00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,670
organizations over these last few years

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,970
and so we're going to talk about some of

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,800
those highlights here in this session

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,030
and we've got a longer session at 11:10

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,100
where we're going to get more into the

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,050
details of exactly how that was done and

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,760
what happened all right but with that

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,890
I'd like to have my panelists introduce

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,540
themselves talk a little bit about you

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,250
know who they work for as well as the

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,960
standards organizations and open source

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,650
projects they've worked with so bill you

00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,500
want to start us off

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,230
yeah thanks Phil bill Carter I'm with

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,980
the Open Compute Project Foundation

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:24,720
we're a open source hardware foundation

00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:27,640
focused on hardware for the data center

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,650
we've we were kind of a late comer to

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,080
the game in terms of open source

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,910
organizations so we had the benefit of

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,670
learning from some of these other

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,510
organizations and being new and small we

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:43,090
knew we needed to collaborate with with

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,450
the standards bodies and so from very

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:50,080
early on we we embraced a lot of the the

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,930
standards bodies for hardware so we

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,480
think of those as ingredients to our

00:04:52,930 --> 00:05:00,340
platform and those ingredients come from

00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,080
the pci-sig comes from DMT a4s ni a

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,690
comes some of some of the storage

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,650
organizations and work groups the t10

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:11,200
the t13 work group just to name a few so

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,419
we've we've been very good at trying to

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,360
embrace those organizations and work

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,850
with them and recognize that that that

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,010
we think of them as an ingredient

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,130
provider and we also work with other

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,930
organizations at the platform level

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,830
again trying to be efficient we don't

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,200
want to replicate work effort and so

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,250
we've worked with some of the Linux

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,640
Foundation project so PMF V and and

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,270
collaborated on on some Pio season and

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,950
Technology Development we're constantly

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,720
talking with the tip organization and

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,419
understanding you know what they're

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,520
doing and what we're doing just to make

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:54,040
sure that we're not you know replicating

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,430
that effort so there's just a couple of

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,890
other examples thanks Terry over to you

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,560
thanks AXA cloud work in my day job

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:05,349
working for Deutsche Telekom's T systems

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,310
and in my night job chairman of the

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,310
board for the telecom

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:14,680
started a little bit more than three

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:18,970
years ago actually looking at OCP and

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,040
the success of OCP we felt we can

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,810
actually apply the open hardware concept

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,340
to the overall telco infrastructure and

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,510
well it's a little bit more challenging

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,150
if you look at the overall turco

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,340
infrastructure especially due to

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,870
intellectual property and patents you

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,690
need to watch out for especially when

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:42,310
you're looking at IPR poisoned areas

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:43,900
like mobile and I have to admit it's

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,470
very tempting when you form a new

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,750
organisation you think hey I'm strong I

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,150
want to show we can do it and we do

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,900
everything ourselves but honestly that

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,610
model is not working if we look at us as

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,210
operators whether extremely limited set

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,460
of skilled resources in this base and I

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:07,180
mentioned this on stage in my keynote at

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:10,330
OH&S Europe last September we have to

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,330
avoid a competition between the various

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,370
organizations we have to collaborate

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,669
among the organizations here and I think

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,710
a good example the announcement we did

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:22,840
just this week together with the open

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,200
networking foundation the collaboration

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,630
between tips open optical effect a

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:35,050
transport group and Darwin F and we were

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:36,280
going to see some more back in September

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,690
last year I wanted to make one

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,440
announcement that was the collaboration

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,960
between the Lynx Foundation and Oren now

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,910
we did it this week so and I think

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,280
you're gonna see more also around the

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,110
radio space each organization has a

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,630
specific strength obviously I see a

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:56,260
Linux Foundation has set in open-source

00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,720
I see tip with a strength on the

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,630
hardware side on the system integration

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,940
site or on another example

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,550
strength on the architecture side and we

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,800
have to work together and we will work

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,500
together very good thank you

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,130
so on PR goatee I'm the chief API

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,250
architect of the Terry management forum

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,889
in that regard we are involved in many

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,379
project

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,629
with a number of SDOs but we also

00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,259
publish a lot of our material in the

00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:31,949
open source we have publish up to 55

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:36,360
api's so far in the open source we're

00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:40,200
looking at publishing a number of what

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,589
we call data models on the open source

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,130
would be easily consumable by the

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:50,130
developer and so on we will publish in

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,019
May the last component suite the network

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,410
of the service component suite so with

00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:58,110
the TM forum is actively involved in

00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:01,140
delivering to the open source

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,920
we also are committed to our membership

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:09,540
to work with other SDOs

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:13,649
the math at C you know onap our members

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:17,430
are actually developing within or on top

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:20,820
of the different project using our

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,649
assets some integration reference points

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,250
so we are completely committed and we

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,899
really believe that it's you this open

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,010
source collaboration that we can

00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,149
accelerate the development of the

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,290
solution here thank you

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:39,449
very good I thought I'm a la Goldner and

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,010
I am director of Technology Strategy in

00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,470
standardization for EM ducts

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,620
so my standardization career extra

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,250
started back in 2005 from free GBP and

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,720
ITF and now I'm also an open source ever

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,970
since on a planche

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,130
I'm a technical student committee member

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,130
and use case subcommittee chair in

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,170
parallel I am participating in 3gpp and

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,760
that's evoke not only i but also people

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,890
working with me internally because

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,690
clearly there is a lot of work to be

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,480
done and one person cannot accomplish

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,630
all of that now I see the collaboration

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,880
between standards and the open source as

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,980
an ongoing activity actually going in

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,199
both direction you know some examples

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,360
may include the free GBP study and then

00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:23,399
now even work item on integration of

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,769
network management with zone up and on

00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,230
the opposite side on up integrate and

00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,750
EDC standard TMF api's as you

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,330
and already that the same now the

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,070
actively working into cooperation also

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,080
between the different tones and sources

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,300
as we talk now there is a meeting of

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,880
Accra in a group discussion actually

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,730
collaboration this Anup so these two

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,710
things really go together and we find

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,860
same people doing this doing both things

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:52,500
on both sides so it is a very

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,480
interesting journey it is not a long

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,130
journey of open-source and standards

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,550
going together but it I think it is

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,530
progressing very well very good thanks a

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,630
lot yeah

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,880
hello my name is Pierre Lynch I'm lead

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,820
technologist with Ixia which is now part

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,220
of keysight technologies I'm here

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,530
representing at Siena V is G which is

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,560
the granddaddy of the communities

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:19,530
looking into using cloud techniques for

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,620
network function virtualization but very

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,630
quickly after the formation of nav I

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,030
think two years later o P and a V came

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,730
on and the collaboration was immediate

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,200
and it was natural especially on the

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,690
testing side and then it progressed from

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,610
that point on as well so that's one of

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,800
the main kind of collaborations that I

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,050
see with that C and a V since then it's

00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,150
expanded to other SDOs a ton of them

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,880
3gpp obviously but from an open source

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,490
perspective opie anivia now onap are the

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,530
main ones and also osm open source man

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,980
oh very good

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:55,920
dan well good morning ad and Pitts I'm

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,050
with meth which used to be the Metro

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,690
Ethernet forum but we officially changed

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,750
our name four years ago to the meth

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,850
forum we started our life as the

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,670
progenitors really of carrier ethernet

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,590
as a service we've now expanded way

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,710
beyond that but we still define and

00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:16,170
certify services we have created a

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:19,080
framework under the umbrella we call

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,060
Neph 3.0 for lifecycle service

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,720
orchestration and in this we abstract

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,810
the key important entities of a telecom

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,120
stack and operations between operators

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,920
and so we define the serve new services

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,630
at layers really one through seven and

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,430
the key ap is that differentiate the

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,020
different abstracted parts of the

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,850
network such as infrastructure control

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,209
and management

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,730
and service orchestration so our goal is

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,290
to promote commercial success of the

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,630
industry and take advantage of the new

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,509
technologies that are being pioneered in

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,709
these organizations and so we have

00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,810
undertaken a number of collaborative

00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:59,060
efforts with open source organizations

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,800
and it's also for us like Alice said a

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,079
two-way street but maybe not in the way

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,360
you're thinking we and our members

00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,579
contribute to these open-source projects

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,759
we take what they do and use it to

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:13,579
instantiate the concepts we have have

00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:17,180
created but we have also embedded and

00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:18,769
embodied the practices of open source to

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,920
sort of a DevOps approach to our

00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:23,560
interface profile specifications and

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,269
interface implementation specifications

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,000
so that we actually issue open source

00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:31,880
versions of these prior to finalizing

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,009
the specifications themselves so we have

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,040
a multi-year history of working closely

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,529
with projects in the Linux Foundation in

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,399
Etsy and in odd places you wouldn't

00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:46,899
expect like the Okinawa open laboratory

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,430
very good Dan so continuing on with that

00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:52,009
I'd like the panelists to answer the

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,569
question so what was the catalyst what

00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,310
was the reason that you actually began

00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:57,319
to work with these open source projects

00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,509
and what did you hope to gain when you

00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:02,240
began that journey then go ahead and

00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:04,519
continue so what we wanted to to gain

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,949
was some rapid feedback on what we were

00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,680
doing we wanted some instances of these

00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:11,720
abstracted notions and reference points

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,699
and the best way to get those and to get

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,430
information from the experience is with

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:17,899
the open source realizations of those so

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,930
the controller projects the

00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:23,060
orchestration projects the the analytics

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,589
projects they're out there you can work

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,509
with and you can try things with them

00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:28,220
put them behind some of our api's and

00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:30,620
see how those function to meet the needs

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,389
of those projects mm-hmm excellent

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,360
Pierre what was the reason behind behind

00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:39,589
it well the first reason was really to

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:43,240
you know we wanted to provide those open

00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:46,100
source API so that the membership could

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,350
actually use them in the open source

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,649
project that's a kind of a strange

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,510
answer but basically the TM forum is

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:58,400
committing the code to do open

00:14:53,510 --> 00:15:02,750
so that folks can actually develop on

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,060
top of onap external api's where we want

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,070
to get the feedback definitely from the

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:12,200
open source community about the quality

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:16,690
of and the requirements of those api's

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:19,460
along those api's and also make them

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:23,270
consumable by any parties really

00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:25,610
including the math Etsy and yeah but

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,500
we're looking at we'll talk about that

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,200
later but we were looking at way more

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,900
collaborative development of those those

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,920
open source project right so anyway how

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,200
was the first step

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:42,980
excellent Thank You Pierre Pierre Lynch

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:44,510
how about the chair - to me it's natural

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,100
the existence of the open-source

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,740
communities came from the fact that we

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,360
were turning networking into software so

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,040
all of a sudden he had all these

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,330
open-source communities they were and

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,520
the goal was in my mind to remove what

00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,080
was bad from standards organizations

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,810
meaning you never got to test what you

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,600
were producing and collaboration with

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,670
open-source meant that not only we

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,740
didn't just throw a document over the

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,360
wall and say hey tell us after we're

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,210
done it was an iterative thing

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,960
especially in the testing world were

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,480
where I'm at

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,520
it was iteratively done during the

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,640
construction of all the work items that

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,110
we had so they helped us out by making

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,030
sure we weren't taking a wrong direction

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,210
by implementing what we were trying to

00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:31,220
do and then secondly we were providing

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,200
ideas and standards to them that they

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,880
could test so it was really really a

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,910
two-way tsering and I think it's been

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,040
fruitful excellent Allah so I actually

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,200
think that the best thing which can

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,690
happen to standard is to have

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,950
open-source implementing it for many

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,150
reasons one of them you know

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,950
unfortunately there are quite a few

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,660
standards which are not implemented so

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,700
actually getting an open-source which

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,410
implement that standard gives a lot of

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,330
relevancy to the standards that

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,460
implement but also to validate

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,010
implementation and to have a common

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,170
implementation which practically reduce

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,450
all interoperability barriers because

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,490
there is already someone who implements

00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,500
which is a community of a different

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,080
vendors and service provider not just

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,320
some vendors going for interoperability

00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,570
in between them so a credibility of

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,670
standard is actually assured by open

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,800
source implementation and this is what

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,830
we see happening now this edge standard

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,660
in ona is TMF api's in Anup as well and

00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,820
with fragility networks lies in this

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,070
fragility streaming data all these

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,200
things that we now test and implementing

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,610
on actually say ok guys this

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,320
implementation is for real this

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,840
implementation is going to be deployed

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,180
and this is the major thing excellent

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,520
thanks a lot max oh yeah

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,220
we want to accelerate the pace of

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,440
innovation for this industry so as part

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:52,490
of the acceleration what you want to

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:55,850
avoid is reinventing wheels and you have

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,470
to work with the parties who already

00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,660
invented the wheel and you have to

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,720
collaborate and we have to work in a

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,630
different way so this is no longer a

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,570
classical telco waterfall it's true

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:11,630
agile work and that requires a level of

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,720
openness and collaboration and it's a

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,400
different way of working also in

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,530
together with the standards organization

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,140
and I'm a firm believer in running code

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,910
and so obviously working with open

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,640
source organizations that gives you a

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:30,980
running code and is straightforward well

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:34,130
we hope that it runs anyway bill yeah I

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:38,060
could just echo what Alan and Axl said

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:40,790
that you know working with the standards

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,530
bodies that you know we could accelerate

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:46,490
the technology and get it to market

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:49,550
quicker in the platforms and and that

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:52,730
was key the other thing that that we've

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:55,520
witnessed is that you know we have an

00:18:52,730 --> 00:19:00,200
end user community but it made up of

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:03,350
primarily hyper scalars and and and and

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,690
they didn't always have a in these

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:09,170
standards bodies and so at the same time

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:12,320
they wanted to evolve those standards

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:14,750
and so as much as we could adopt a

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,170
standard and get it to market quickly we

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,800
also wanted to evolve it quickly and so

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,730
we

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,710
we took advantage of having those those

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,990
folks the hyper scalars in our

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,000
communities and in talking with each

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,190
other and understanding what could be

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,170
done better and then we were able to

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,260
feed that back into the standards bodies

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:38,420
and so now it's become a two-way street

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,100
between between our organization and

00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,560
these standards organizations and it's

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,900
there they embrace it they appreciate

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,540
our feedback and and we appreciate what

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,900
we get from them all right very good

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:53,090
thanks Bill so Allah I'm gonna direct

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,040
the next question for you to start I'd

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,680
like you to talk a little bit about what

00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,720
you find to be the most significant

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,660
successes that you've seen working

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,430
between open standards bodies and open

00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,170
source but at the same time you know

00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,810
don't be afraid to talk about challenges

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,610
right onap living in a world where it's

00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,480
trying to be compliant with etsy man oh

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,930
wow

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,280
not is is one of the things we're

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,900
working through right so talk a little

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,270
bit about both successes and where you

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,430
see that we've got more work to do yeah

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:25,640
so I've mentioned already did those

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:28,580
which I consider successes so some of

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,130
sole interface is implementation so - so

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,910
free now the reason and going so far

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,750
implementation and on some of TMF api's

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:41,120
for ordering for inventory

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,280
these are successes also free GPP again

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,880
we are doing a lot of work on networks

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,480
license ID for modern investment for GBP

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:53,090
5g standard section this goes well well

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,800
unfortunately as as you've mentioned we

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,930
have that ongoing discussion what should

00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,030
be implemented which results both from

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,380
service providers requirements not all

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,760
of those standards which already

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,590
implemented Eric right and required

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,720
urgently and because of lack of

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,790
resources right we don't have resources

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,340
to implement everything so we do get a

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:14,180
requirements that more is needed so this

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,040
is where perhaps things fall apart a

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,650
little bit but I don't think that anyone

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,140
you know blocks it it has probably a

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:23,540
matter of time and he'll be get there

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,430
but we own that way so as I said we do

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,980
have already quite a few implementation

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,650
and we plan to implement more now I

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,560
would actually you know as something

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,030
may go bad she would mention it perhaps

00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,790
integration or harmonization between on

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:40,130
up and OS n which are to open-source and

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,620
we started some organization effort and

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,600
again right now it fall apart probably

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,940
because of lack of resources probably

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,620
because there is no strong push here

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,050
from service provider side and this is

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,690
the trigger which moves us forward in

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,150
open-source obviously and I hopefully

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,910
that will be preceded as well now the

00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,310
big effort which I see currently

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,380
starting an ongoing is interaction

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,090
between onap and zero-touch that the

00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,310
same exes at the same group and Klaus

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,050
martini actually is chair is also in

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,180
this room and this week we had a very

00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,100
good discussion with them and we will

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,320
have a more discussion also today and

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,750
they are starting an activity to see how

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,940
it is at the same architecture can be

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,460
mapped with owner preference

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,250
architecture and perhaps identify gaps

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,380
and and and and and go forward jointly

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,570
actually but identifying also their

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,400
architecture along this own up and what

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,160
we achieve this honorable so these are

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,560
big things that I would mention very

00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,860
good thanks a lot

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:44,180
yeah yes I think we have been quite

00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:48,230
successful in implementing extra what we

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:52,910
would call external API so the NBI

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:56,120
believe api's the TM forum api's and on

00:22:52,910 --> 00:23:00,640
top of on up and we're really looking at

00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:05,570
way more work in that space that so

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:08,450
something that is coming as far as onap

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:10,970
is concerned otherwise the TM forum API

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:14,240
is in the open source are implemented by

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:17,090
a very large number of organization and

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,200
other SDO and we'd like to use own app

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:23,510
as a as a catalyst for further evolution

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,240
of our API so I'm kind of following up

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,950
on the fact that the - open source will

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,180
get more requirements will get more

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,180
quality yeah and

00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:37,100
provide artifacts that are even more

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:40,320
useful for our membership

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:42,840
very good thanks BIA axel what do you

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,870
see with tip working with both open

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,309
source as well as other standards bodies

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,690
the successes as well as where do you

00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:50,820
see the challenges what do you think

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,700
means yeah let me stop let me start with

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,850
the challenge maybe this industries of

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:59,640
the taiko industry is blessed with very

00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:03,210
simple standards isn't it does anyone

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,190
believe we have simple standards in no

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,080
industry no probably not so we are

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,440
facing utterly complex standards still

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,390
and that is one of the challenges also

00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,990
for open-source is why don't you find

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,760
and full of open source IMS or EPC

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:21,240
implementations cuz the standards are

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,010
indeed fairly complex now if you want to

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,690
reinvent how you're building telco

00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,980
infrastructure you need to think first

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:32,309
how you can simplify and I think that is

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,830
what we have to address and here the the

00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:37,919
collaboration with OCP I think is it's

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,200
an excellent example rethinking how

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,700
things were done and then moving forward

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,559
I think also looking outside of my tip

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,720
role I was also for some time

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,100
representing DT in the 11 board

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,350
I still believe own app is is a great

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,750
proof for success in this industry that

00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,059
really the operators the vendors came

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,250
together here and were working on one

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:05,429
open source solution because how many

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:09,330
open source solutions in this space a

00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:14,159
telco can afford yeah so I think that is

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:18,870
still a great success point for the

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,640
industry very good thanks Bill yeah I

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,880
think we have a you know a couple of

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,340
challenges you know we we have a lot of

00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,620
options and there's a you know a lot of

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:32,220
different open source projects that

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:34,320
spawn off and you know there's a lot of

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,000
overlap there there's even on the

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,950
hardware side there's different overlaps

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,710
and different other you know

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,360
organizations and I think the challenge

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,350
that we have

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,560
as as you know leaders in the

00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,360
open-source community is to you know

00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,600
wherever possible is to avoid those

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,200
overlaps and to reach out to these other

00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,740
organizations and choose to to work

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,200
together rather than work separately you

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:08,160
know Klaw sees the example or I'm sorry

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,590
actually use the example of own app and

00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,580
that's a good example where you have you

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:16,200
know a good you know application there

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,600
and if you can get everybody working on

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,240
that one application you you could just

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,390
accelerate that but so much so much

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,120
faster and you know we see the same

00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:30,540
thing on the hardware side you know we

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,860
recently launched a new network

00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:36,240
interface card standard and and if you

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,930
look over the years there's a lot of

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,140
proprietary little adapter cards that

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:45,420
have been available and you know podiums

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,090
and OEMs and companies have built their

00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:51,300
own standard event the old card and you

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,010
know after six or eight years of going

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:57,240
down this path we finally got everybody

00:26:53,010 --> 00:27:01,380
together and and we we came up with what

00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:04,230
it was our third generation spec but we

00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,680
had 12 companies come together and

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,120
author it and you know it took nominally

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,700
eight years if you look at the three

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,520
generations but once we all had got

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,620
together in the room and and worked on

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,710
one thing and and really had a

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,690
commitment that that is going to be the

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,760
standard you know the the de-facto

00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,990
standard were going to use and we're

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,600
going to make it work

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:30,600
and it may not be perfect but it's good

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,600
enough and and there was this commitment

00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:37,680
to see it through and to implement it

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,620
and adopt it and the standard the the

00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,200
the final version was was finalized at

00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:46,290
the beginning of the year we had our

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,090
summit a couple of weeks ago dozens and

00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:51,060
dozens of different designs are now

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:53,810
already showing up with this with this

00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,020
new card right

00:27:53,810 --> 00:28:01,540
we we had to borrow some some underlying

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:05,300
technology and IP from the pci-sig and

00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,670
and again they recognized that that was

00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,560
that we were doing was a good thing it

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:12,950
was being done it within a collaboration

00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,470
in the open-source community and they

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,690
and we could use some of their tools for

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,760
test and validation and so excellent you

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,730
know we we engaged in this conversation

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,790
and and didn't know how to didn't know

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,560
where we were gonna go but we walked

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:30,500
down that path together and we figured

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,910
out you know how we could share very

00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,840
good and it resulted in a you know a

00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,620
great product

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,920
cool thanks Bill then successes and

00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,570
challenges so I have a an example of a

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,640
successful collaboration and then I also

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:46,820
have my favorite collaboration they're

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,410
not the same so I think the successful

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,140
one is where we've worked boasted with

00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,240
onap and open daylight to get agreement

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,370
on some of the use cases starting with

00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,920
carry youth and Ethernet and some of the

00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:02,360
api's and our API essentially build

00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:04,790
content into the TM form AP API

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,830
templates both the north-south and

00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,750
legato north phone app and and presto

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,700
southbound from open daylight but also

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:13,310
east-west and Sanada and increasingly

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,660
interlude between operators and this has

00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,460
given us good feedback but more

00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:20,360
importantly it's given our members a

00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,250
chance to instantiate and trial real

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,550
live service concatenation between

00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:28,190
operators now I think my most success my

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,840
most favorite my favorite one is when

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,370
it's not been wholly successful but it's

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,490
been the most instructive and that's the

00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:36,770
collaboration in information modeling so

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:40,370
we've worked with own app with IETF with

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:42,350
oh I F with Owen F and with Etsy and we

00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,910
kind of had it out one day in Los

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,320
Angeles a couple years ago a number of

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,350
people in the room done Ling Li and

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,910
others were in in there that day and own

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,930
app had a deadline and they needed a

00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:53,660
release they needed some information

00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:55,250
models and we have to agree on these but

00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,370
you know we also want them to be

00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:01,130
long-lived and an architectural perfect

00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,810
and you couldn't have both but the the

00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,799
deadlines of an open source release

00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,299
forced us to come to a compromise of

00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:09,460
what we could live with for now and his

00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:11,489
bill says better is the enemy of good

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:16,480
enough and we had to go with good enough

00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:19,360
excellent thanks Dan mm-hmm yeah I at

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,610
the Etsy level at Siena V level I think

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,289
Alec addressed the the challenges there

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,389
very well between the Solutions Group

00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:28,029
and the API is and coming together on

00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:29,619
that so I won't mention that again on

00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:31,210
the test level and by the way I keep

00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:33,340
focusing on tests because I chair the

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,889
tests an open source working group at at

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,109
Siena V it's been a little bit more blue

00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:40,149
blue skies and sunshine honestly it's

00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:42,279
it's been a ton of success and I'll

00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:45,340
mention two the first one that I love is

00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,350
the co-located plugfest that we had less

00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,549
than a year ago where we got people from

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:53,139
Etsy and people from from o P and a V

00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:54,999
all together in the same place and that

00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:57,249
meant that they could figure they could

00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:58,960
watch how we do interoperability events

00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:01,749
and then we could join all their project

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,429
meetings and and be less intimidated by

00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:06,519
the cool people getting stuff done at

00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:09,970
the open source level the second success

00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,559
that I love is there were Opie nav was

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,679
seen difficulties in repeatedly

00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:17,049
repeatability of results for benchmark

00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,919
network benchmark testing that triggered

00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:22,720
a work item in it at Etsy test where we

00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,299
basically did one of the most important

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,539
works I've ever seen as we modernize how

00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:30,609
to do network benchmarking in a

00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:33,580
virtualized shared platform world

00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:35,559
because the old specs simply didn't hold

00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,239
up I'll talk more detail about that in

00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,889
the next session later on but I think

00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:42,009
those two are very very good success

00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:45,100
very good very good thanks Pierre so

00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:46,419
yeah again if you have questions and

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,340
that's you've been spurred from this

00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:49,749
discussion or if you want to learn a

00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,950
little bit more about how the sausage

00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:53,230
has been made and we'll get I'm sure

00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,269
more into challenges please join us at

00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,340
the 11:10 session we have more

00:31:55,269 --> 00:32:00,669
opportunity to go much more deeply into

00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:02,600
these topics and with that please help

00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:10,350
me in thanking our wonderful panelists

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:10,350
