00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,359
good morning everyone my name is Dan

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,160
Khan I'm the executive director of the

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,170
cloud native computing foundation I

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,230
would like to particularly thank our

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,880
Pitts and Phil Rob and Jill and the

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,410
entire elf events team for putting

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,930
together this event so an incredibly

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,090
productive three days for me really

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,800
interesting group of folks here that

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:26,160
I've been able to engage with and have a

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,369
ton of of meetings for the last six

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,859
months networking has been a major new

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,290
focus for the cloud native computing

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,649
foundation were best known for hosting

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,230
kubernetes and we have had a lot of

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,980
success in the cloud and in enterprise

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,730
software computing but we see telecoms

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,340
as the next big market to go after and

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,980
so our Pitt and I have been literally

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,170
circling the world together doing a road

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,879
show in China and then booth together in

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,160
Mobile World Congress and such but it's

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,379
been a great collaboration so I think

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,049
everyone is familiar with kubernetes at

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,299
this point it was originally created by

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,490
Google but has now had major

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,430
contributions from Red Hat from

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,560
Microsoft from Huawei from really all

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,590
the companies the 17 Platinum members

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,150
listed at the bottom here and now

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,340
hundreds of other companies thousands of

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,460
other developers but that's just one of

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,930
the projects in Cincy eff we now have

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,790
five graduated projects and sixteen

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,659
incubating that are a little less mature

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,920
but still being used in production by

00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:41,450
hundreds of companies around the world

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:44,909
so CN CF has now just crossed over 390

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,649
members that's up from 28 when we

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,130
launched just a little bit more than

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,890
three years ago and we're both the

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,619
largest and one of the fastest growing

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,390
ever open-source foundations and so I

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,820
did want to just give a little bit of

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,790
background on that and then share some

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,250
lessons that we've learned an approach

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,039
that might be useful to the open source

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,770
networking community just as a look at

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,540
that growth this is looking at Google

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,010
Trends so what people search for in

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,049
Google

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,599
and you can see that three years ago

00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:19,610
when we launched kubernetes was quite

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,519
low right with docker swarm and mazes

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,890
OpenStack and Cloud Foundry and other

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,079
than the fact that people really like to

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,360
take that week off between Christmas and

00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:32,870
New Year's we've had this very steady

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,329
growth over three years and it continues

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,989
today and then on the right side you can

00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:41,120
see on WeChat search and China has been

00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,629
an enormous market for us we have a huge

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,970
number of members and users and

00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,890
certified versions and such and there as

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,980
well we've just had a huge amount of

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,079
interest in growth this is a kind of a

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,840
complicated chart but it is just a way

00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:58,879
of looking at the velocity of open

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,849
source projects so the size of the

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,190
bubble is how many unique developers are

00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,049
working on a project how high up it is

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,900
is how many commits that's had in the

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:12,230
last year how far to the right shows how

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,760
many issues and and pull requests and

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,040
you can see that depending on how you

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,859
count kubernetes is the second or third

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:25,340
highest velocity project in open source

00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:27,680
just behind Linux and probably over the

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:31,160
last three years the program where CN CF

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,519
has generated the most value and has had

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,440
the biggest impact on our ecosystem is

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,319
certified kubernetes and this is a way

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,440
it's an automated testing system and a

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,629
process behind that to ensure that of

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,519
kubernetes that you purchase from

00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,069
different vendors or used in a hosted

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,160
cloud environment or just download the

00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:54,139
the pure upstream version are all

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,260
compatible that they all support the

00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,659
same api's and so we're really proud of

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,239
the fact that we have 83 certified

00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:04,549
kubernetes partners and we've actually

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,829
collaborated quite closely with LF

00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,720
networking on the ovp certification

00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,639
program that was announced this week

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,079
which in fact is using a lot of the same

00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:17,630
processes and documents and such ok so

00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,209
that's a canned history of CN CF what

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,090
have we learned and what are three ideas

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:26,400
that would apply over to open source

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:29,310
networking the first one is a loose

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,220
coupling and this is the idea that all

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,190
of the projects in CNC F do work

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,160
together they add value they solve

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,720
related problems but they're not welded

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,150
to each other and so different

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,060
enterprises select different projects

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,270
that they find useful different platform

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,440
providers glue them together or or

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,660
bundle them together in different ways

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,240
and I want to emphasize that this leaves

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,100
space for innovation it lets people

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,410
focus on the areas that they're

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,169
interested in where their talents are

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,330
and it's closely related to another CN

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,600
CF principle that we're not the

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,270
kingmakers and so explicitly when we

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,340
pick a project and we say okay this is a

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,830
great container runtime or this is a

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,260
great service mash or this is a good

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,310
tool for service discovery that is not

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,810
the N word the final story for CN CF and

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,900
what we're endorsing and we explicitly

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,690
have a policy that we can have we can

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,820
host multiple projects in the same box

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,979
so for example we support multiple

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,750
container runtimes today and we'll

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,470
probably see more of that in the future

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,539
as more projects come into CMC F so we

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,849
do think that that loose coupling adds a

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,800
lot of value and allows innovation to

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:48,150
occur at different rates in different

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,229
parts of our ecosystem second idea is to

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:54,750
minimize toil and so we really see

00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:56,760
developer productivity as one of the

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,250
most important constraints that we're

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,470
trying to optimize for and so that means

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,229
that we to the degree possible provide

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,060
just a variety of different services to

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:09,270
our projects that help make the

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,460
developers more productive and makes it

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,830
easier for them to collaborate in

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,440
particular we're perfectly happy to use

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,199
commercial services to do this when

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,599
those work well as an example I believe

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,849
kubernetes now has the largest slack

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:29,550
public slack implementation in the world

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:33,720
it has thousands of new users every week

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:36,090
it's just kind of a crazy process to

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,969
support but we also use a zoom video

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,960
calls and then publish all of those to

00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,270
YouTube

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,740
hopefully within a day or so so that a

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,720
people who couldn't make the call or who

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,180
need to go back later and review have

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,060
access to that we use github we use open

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,210
mailing lists we use a lot of Google

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,060
Docs and interestingly we don't mandate

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,100
what those tools are to the project We

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,530
certainly have some defaults that we

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,960
recommend but we're constantly open to

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,850
trying new ones into accepting the fact

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,070
that different projects often want to

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,110
use different tools and we support them

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,820
in doing that now I want to particularly

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,430
call out the role of continuous

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,020
integration a key driver of the

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,150
kubernetes project success and

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,060
robustness has been the level of

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:25,259
investment that we've made every weekday

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,180
we run over 10,000 CI jobs every time

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,160
someone opens a pull request it runs

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,009
that CI job and then in addition every

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,229
two days we run a new scalability test

00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,870
of a hundred and fifty thousand

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,970
containers across five thousand virtual

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,490
machines now the smaller projects are

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,639
not at that scale but they all Rock rely

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,949
on CI from platforms as well and

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,780
interestingly we don't really mandate or

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,150
even have a preferred one different

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,830
projects use different CI providers and

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,710
we're happy to support them on that and

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,190
then the third one I would say is the

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,110
value of marketing of vision and so

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,169
kubernetes is the anchor tenant of CN CF

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:06,060
and an incredibly important project but

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,599
we do try and share a larger vision

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,870
about what cloud native means about a

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,099
way of reducing costs and improving

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:17,789
resiliency and most importantly

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:21,180
increasing developer velocity and so two

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:23,789
examples of this is that we don't try

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,909
and say that the CNC F way or hosting

00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:29,009
using all CMC F projects is the only way

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:31,770
of successfully being a cloud native

00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,610
enterprise or for this audience a cloud

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:38,279
native calcio we have some recommended

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,320
options but we also created this diagram

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,659
please raise your hand if you've seen

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,980
the cloud native landscape before this

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:49,130
has been described to me as useful

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,320
overwhelming and the hellscape

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,160
interestingly the same person did two of

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,560
those it is an over well

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,750
document there's a cool interactive tool

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,329
at the top that you can go to on your

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,209
phone or your computer l for landscape

00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:06,519
CN CF do that actually lets you research

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:09,550
each of these projects and products you

00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,529
can see that the grade ones are closed

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,420
source products the white ones are open

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,240
source but we are trying to make a

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,550
statement here that it's not actually

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,250
that we're making the world complicated

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,470
we're the map maker the world itself is

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,170
complicated there's a lot of different

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,240
options and so then the other diagram

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,310
that we think is incredibly valuable is

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,500
what we call the cloud native trail map

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:35,050
and this is really designed to be the

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,029
front side of the document the landscape

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,769
on the back and I will say you can walk

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:41,319
over to the CN CF booth after this

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,290
session and and pick up a print copy

00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:46,540
here but in my experience I don't think

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,769
there's actually an enterprise that is

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:54,040
using all 21 of the CN CF graduated and

00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:56,560
incubating projects and nothing else no

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,350
commercial products no other open source

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,899
projects that in reality people are

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:05,620
mixing and matching to a huge degree and

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,250
what we hope is that an enterprise a

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,620
telco

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,329
will look at the CF CF project will

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,370
evaluate it and try and understand its

00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:14,380
strengths and weaknesses before making

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,589
their decision but there's no obligation

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,959
to it that loose coupling is a really

00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:22,240
key thought here so those were the the

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,060
three big ideas loose coupling minimize

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,290
toil market vision these are all things

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,329
that open source networking

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,670
organizations like elf networking have

00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:33,670
already begun to do but could perhaps

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,860
put more resources into and then finally

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,720
I do want to just mention two other CN

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,779
CF activities that might be of interest

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,029
to this community one is an area that

00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,709
we've been working with elf networking

00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:48,309
and others on it's called the cloud

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:50,529
native network function testbed this is

00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:51,850
a project it's open source it's

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,339
available right now if you'd like to

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,529
participate where we took some open

00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,620
source network functions out of the onap

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:01,809
project and repackage them not in

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,370
virtual machines but in containers run

00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:05,559
them on OpenStack and on top of

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,220
kubernetes on identical bare-metal

00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,620
servers that have been very generous

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,110
donated to us by the bare-metal hosting

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,810
company packet and you can just google

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,759
for this CNF testbed and see an online

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,350
presentation a lot of detail about it

00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,430
and then we are having monthly phone

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,790
calls where we're talking about

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:25,360
collaboration there's some aspects of

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,920
how we're making this perform today that

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,990
everything is automated it's all in the

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,959
open-source repo but I would describe

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:36,560
some some of it as being out-of-band

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,420
that it is done in a more manual ways

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,910
and we're interested in having all that

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,220
be automated into kubernetes and then

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,769
finally I'd be remiss not to mention CN

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,019
CF s-- conferences we host cube con

00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:52,550
cloud native con our event in Barcelona

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:55,129
on May 20th is expecting over 10,000

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,750
attendees it's going to be the largest

00:11:55,129 --> 00:12:01,399
open source developer conference in

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,949
history that's up from 8,000 you can see

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,350
our growth here over the last three

00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:08,660
years from 500 when we got started up to

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,839
8,000 in Seattle will then be in

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,910
Shanghai a June 2426 that's going to be

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,949
joint with the open source summit and

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,170
we'll have a lot of networking content

00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:22,040
and then we're expecting an even bigger

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:25,759
event in San Diego November 18th to 21st

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,829
and so I hope that many of you will be

00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,110
there and have your your colleagues go

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:31,540
there and I'll stop there thank you all

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,890
very much for your time

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,890
