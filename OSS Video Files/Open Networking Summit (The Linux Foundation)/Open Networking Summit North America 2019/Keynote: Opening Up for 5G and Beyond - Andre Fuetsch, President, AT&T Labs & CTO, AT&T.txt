	00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,030
firstnet is one of those opportunities

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,820
to make a fundamental difference in

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,360
every public safety responders approach

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,580
to managing emergencies

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,029
we've got agencies converging onto one

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,720
central geographic location

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:24,779
communication and getting resources

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,910
where they need to be is a challenge by

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,439
no fault whatsoever of the individuals

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,000
that are there responding to the scene

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,340
it's the technology that they had

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,520
available to them they're trying to

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,380
coordinate a disastrous mass chaos this

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
is when the network gets bogged down and

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,610
they can't communicate with one another

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,850
because the system was not set up to do

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,850
so

00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,040
[Music]

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,560
the technology that they've used at this

00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,810
point really pales in comparison to what

00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,989
we're going to provide them on firstnet

00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,989
[Music]

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,829
this individual is missing this is their

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,610
potential location and then we can call

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:08,450
for a helicopter to have live infrared

00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:11,090
searching for an individual figure guys

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,940
now communications between agencies and

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,680
among agencies always talking always up

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:22,009
on the network always using the data

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,200
live in real time so we can search

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,810
quicker we can find people quicker and

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,950
then as soon as we find a victim we can

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:36,500
get them extricated triage treated

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:38,119
transport it to the hospital we're

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,220
putting tools in their hands that they

00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,910
can see what's happening around them and

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,860
react to it in a way that saves lives

00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:49,570
I'm really proud to be part of something

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,450
that's gonna revolutionize Public Safety

00:01:49,570 --> 00:02:16,579
we're gonna take really good care

00:01:51,450 --> 00:02:17,970
[Music]

00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:22,370
thank you

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,829
please welcome Andre thank you our pit

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,970
hey good morning everyone it's really

00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:30,269
great to be here

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,700
back at ons and I really want to just

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:36,720
thank everyone that's participating

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,609
especially those out on the web and you

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,480
know a lot of changes going on over the

00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:45,209
last year and ons actually is my

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,900
favorite conference to come to because I

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:51,060
believe this is really where all the

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,420
real big change is going to happen and

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,159
it's happening with many of you and I'm

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,639
really excited that we actually got OH&S

00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,989
back to the Bay Area from Los Angeles

00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:06,269
last year because I think this is really

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:10,620
where a lot of this Software Defined

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,629
Networking revolution started but

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,760
certainly it's now a global phenomenon

00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:19,260
and it's and you being here and the the

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,930
companies and the communities you

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:26,280
represent is a testament to that so

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:30,299
really great to be back here and also

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,120
just wanted to say just thank you for

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,799
everyone that's you know all the demo

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,190
booths and things going on really

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:41,459
exciting things going on and your

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,220
participation is so important because as

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,729
you saw in that video

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,359
this technology is having an impact

00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:54,599
everywhere not just you know the the the

00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:58,349
normal mass-market consumer but all the

00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,639
way to you know first responders and the

00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,359
technology you're going to see and I'll

00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:05,459
talk a little bit about it is actually

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,799
at the heart of those services you saw

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,680
in that video so really great stuff

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,040
going on so let me talk a little bit

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,620
about AT&T and by the numbers here and

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,769
the clicker is not working ok there we

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,769
go

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,910
AT&T you know we talk a lot about what

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,860
we're doing here in the United State

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,880
but I want to remind folks here we're a

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:35,040
global company in fact we connect the

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:39,330
world we connect to over 214 countries

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,210
and territories a lot of what we do

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:48,000
isn't just wireless technology we do a

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:50,390
lot of wired technology as well and you

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,180
can see there we actually have well over

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:58,650
1.1 million fiber route miles around the

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:01,410
world and the traffic across this

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,560
network is growing at an unprecedented

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:11,220
clip so right now the traffic that we

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:13,680
haul every day has now eclipsed over 250

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,990
petabytes a day you put that in

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,950
perspective you know think about the

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:22,040
entire Library of Congress that actually

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:25,380
fits into about a quarter of a petabyte

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,870
so every day we are actually hauling

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,690
back and forth a thousand libraries of

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,840
Congress across the network pretty

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,900
impressive when you look at that traffic

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,050
the majority of that traffic a little

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,900
over 50% of it is actually video based

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,260
traffic so if you didn't believe that

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,270
video is really taking off and growing I

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,490
can tell you it already is here and it's

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,350
just going to continue to grow in fact

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,220
over the next several years we predict

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,640
video will be well well over 70 percent

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,520
of the traffic we haul

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:06,300
now on the wireless side of this we've

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,370
been talking a lot about 5g and we're

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,380
really excited to have launched our

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:16,350
first mobile 5g cities late last year

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,570
those were 12 cities we also have nine

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,830
that we announced for this year that

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:25,980
will will be coming online here soon and

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,380
I'm proud to say San Francisco and San

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:34,380
Jose are on that list so you'll be

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:37,560
excited about that and you know again

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:41,160
data demand is is just booming so I

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,530
mentioned that 250 plus petabytes a day

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,570
if you go all the way back to when the

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,380
first smartphone started to emerge back

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:51,870
in 2007 that represents over a four

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,690
hundred and seventy thousand percent

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,490
increase in traffic demand so is a

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,610
pretty significant hockey stick that

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:03,600
we're seeing here now going out into the

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:07,560
future here this tsunami of demand is

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,690
not abetting at all in fact if you look

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,570
at some analysts reports out there

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,580
specifically the Cisco virtual

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,450
networking index report just released

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:22,890
about a month ago they predict another

00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:25,950
3x increase in the global IP traffic and

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:28,770
when you look at the effects of the

00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:33,240
mobile side of that they predict a 7x

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:35,789
increase in mobile IP traffic and

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,580
there's a prediction that over 70% of

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,850
that traffic in five years will actually

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:47,190
be coming from wireless devices so if

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:50,039
you don't believe 5g is gonna drive this

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,680
well I'm here to tell you it it's really

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,320
gonna open up the doors here and I think

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,789
you can see why 5g is a technology

00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:03,380
that's really going to drive hyper

00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:06,090
connectivity so it's not just connecting

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,850
smartphones and tablets it's going to be

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,979
connecting everything the capabilities

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,430
of the network are going to give us the

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:16,919
capability to more cost efficiently

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,500
connect millions of devices within a

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,919
square mile whereas today we can

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,789
probably only do thousands and so that's

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,940
why 5g so important and really the heart

00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:32,039
of 5g the foundations of 5g are really

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,960
based on the fundamentals of

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,250
software-defined networking and

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:40,110
virtualization it's a lot going on there

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,620
so let me talk a little bit about sort

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,130
of the jury

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,210
journey we've been on over the last five

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:52,560
years or so and it really started with

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:54,839
John Donovan and this great vision to

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,779
really embrace software-defined

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,890
networking and bringing this

00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:01,290
transformation from a hardware centric

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:04,560
network to a software centric network

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,990
and we're really pleased that John is

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,900
actually now our CEO so if you're ever

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,720
questioning the commitment we have it

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:17,070
all the way to the top and that's really

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,980
important because as you can see AT&T we

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,250
like to feel that we are not just major

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,440
contributors but major leaders in this

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,860
whole revolution that's going on so if

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,490
you go back to 2014 we announced our Sdn

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:36,150
vision actually right here at ons it was

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:40,140
actually a lot smaller crowd and then

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:45,600
quickly in 2015 with some great work

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:48,500
with onf and many others we started

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,060
virtualizing our Jeep on olt

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:55,230
architecture to take advantage of ATT's

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,720
fiber footprint and we expanded that by

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,430
actually working with the Open Compute

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,510
Project to put a lot of that technology

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,860
the hardware into the open so that we

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:09,570
could start developing open source

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:12,990
software on top of it then in 2016 we

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:17,700
put into the open our ecomp platform

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:19,529
which became later named onap everything

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,260
you saw in that video that firstnet

00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:24,779
video is actually automated and

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,380
orchestrated with own app that firstnet

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:31,800
network everything we're doing in terms

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:36,180
of our 5g deployment is taking advantage

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,610
of own app and many other software open

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,200
source projects that are going on and I

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,950
really want to give a shout-out to Chris

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,930
Rice Nagala bez and their leadership

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,170
teams and many of which are here in this

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,670
room today because they really have

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,980
taken this vision and made it a reality

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:57,199
and really really great work they

00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:04,190
then in 20 okay nice applause there

00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:07,370
thank you then in 2017 we announced our

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,410
first live trial on a white box which

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:14,149
this was a really an industry-first

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:19,029
in the carrier space for us and then in

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:22,850
2018 last year we announced a white box

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:26,209
router for our cell sites where we'll be

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,940
deploying over the next few years here

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:32,300
over 65,000 of these in fact we have

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,100
these in production now and you can

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,600
actually see some of that implementation

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,279
in one of the booths back there so

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,920
really encourage you to go check it out

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:44,510
so a lot going on there okay so all this

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,510
all these great things happening so what

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:50,079
are they happening on well it's really

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:54,800
on a foundation of some amazing

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,420
open-source projects out there and you

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,639
know this this isn't a journey we've

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,160
done by ourselves we've really done it

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,440
with some great partnerships and a

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,970
really really great developer

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,540
communities out there and all of you and

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:14,420
when you look at a lot of these logos

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,449
out here there's ones that certainly

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,399
stand out more some have been out there

00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:20,839
a little longer than others but I would

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,449
tell you all of these are equally

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,290
important because they're all part of

00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:29,269
this great vision and solution this

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:32,139
puzzle if you will that we're putting

00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:35,360
together here and we're learning a

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:38,180
tremendous amount and we're learning it

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,899
at a velocity that we've never had

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,709
before and we're learning it with a much

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:48,589
greater community and this is allowing

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:51,170
these capabilities to lower the entry

00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:54,050
barrier for more innovative solutions

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,910
and players to come into the mix and so

00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:00,260
this is what this whole open source

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,910
initiative is really all about so let me

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,160
get into a little more specifics on a

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,500
few of these that are going on so just

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,010
to highlight a couple and related to

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,000
some of the

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:14,690
announcements we just made so in the

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,780
last year here we talked a lot about our

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,450
data centers using lightbox which is a

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:23,810
lot of those we have now in place that

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:26,090
are carrying live 5g traffic as I

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:30,500
mentioned a lot of this is powered by

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:34,850
own app and this is part of our big push

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:38,060
to virtualize and Sdn control our

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,880
network if you recall back five years

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:44,810
ago almost five years four years ago we

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,930
set out a very audacious goal to Sdn

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:51,230
control and virtualized 75% of our

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:56,180
network and I'm proud to say end of last

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:59,180
year we hit the 65 percent mark so we're

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:02,180
we're almost there and this year our

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,410
goal is to get to 70 percent a lot of

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,120
folks have asked me well hey wait a

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,210
minute andrei some years you've done 20%

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,230
why now only five well we kind of left

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:15,170
all the hard stuff for last so we are

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:19,460
well on a path here to get to our goal

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,390
of 75% by the end of 2020 and and again

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:26,630
really due to the really great hard work

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:30,820
by many in this room also we're really

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:35,450
excited about how open-source is now

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:37,100
going to unlock and open a part of the

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,890
network where we've seen a tremendous

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,700
amount of technology and vendor lock-in

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:49,520
and that's the radio access network so

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:52,460
just yesterday in partnership with Iran

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:58,550
that's the open radio access network

00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:01,610
alliance in in collaboration with Nokia

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,220
AT&T and Nokia contributed and

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:08,180
introduced the first piece of open

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,940
source software for what we call the ran

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,920
intelligent controller and we're really

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:18,160
excited about this because this is a

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,730
just the beginning here to start opening

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,939
up the capabilities of the radio access

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,339
network to not only give us more

00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:29,589
visibility of what's going on but give

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:33,279
us more control so this is going to

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:37,600
allow us to better utilize our ran

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:40,899
assets and resources but also to allow

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,379
us to create more value add services and

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,449
experiences for end customers in fact

00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:48,069
we've got a really cool demo that I

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:52,329
encourage all of you to go check out

00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:54,790
that actually shows this ran intelligent

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:58,990
controller we call it the Rick actually

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:02,499
in use and it's a really great testament

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:05,730
and shows about shows how a mere time a

00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:08,610
near real-time controller can work and

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:14,519
we think this is just the beginning here

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:17,529
in the rand space also we just recently

00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,750
made some great advances here in the

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:24,550
transport layer and this is with our

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:29,110
open Rotom initiative and we expect AT&T

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:31,420
to be the first to 400 gig of course

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,059
with the tsunami of demand that's going

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,879
to come with 5g we've got to have a

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,430
backbone a transport network that can

00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:42,670
handle that tsunami and really we've got

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:45,399
to upgrade from 100 to 400 and a lot

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,980
going on there and also what's DRI

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:51,100
helping us drive this is this open road

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,949
initiative that's bringing in more

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,319
interoperability again traditionally a

00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:58,300
space the network where's a lot of

00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:03,040
lock-in in terms of the technology and

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,319
only a few players now we've gotten to

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,659
sort of break that open so that we can

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,539
get a lot more competition and intermix

00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,850
and match and again lower the entry

00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:15,549
barrier to get more innovation into that

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,159
space so very exciting work going on

00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:23,199
there and this partnership here was

00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:25,410
really we recently formed this with

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,900
Siena Fujitsu

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:33,890
Raj and others and we did this and

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,330
demonstrated this and just recently

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,550
where we showed how this actually can

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,600
work together quite effectively and I

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,790
think you're going to see some really

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,970
exciting advances here in the near

00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:48,600
future as we bring begin to upgrade our

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:51,030
network to these new speeds and then

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,600
also I want to mention what's been going

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:58,770
on with another partner open source

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,290
organization onf and some really great

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,680
work going on in terms of opening up

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:07,590
access and specifically I wanted to call

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,530
out the Seba program the Sdn enabled

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,230
broadband access program and this is

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:16,140
again bringing much more commoditized

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:19,410
hardware solutions open solutions but

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:23,580
also open source software to bring

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:26,670
higher speeds better services across our

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,260
wireline infrastructure as well and so a

00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,500
lot of great work going on there

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,160
and then also we've also announced this

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,870
week a lot of work in the white box

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:42,230
space we actually have a deployment now

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,800
in Toronto and London that are now live

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:49,380
where we deployed a white box solution

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:52,410
with a routing stack that's part that

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,570
will be part of danos and that's

00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,620
something that we will introduce into

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,880
the community here soon and our

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:04,460
expectation is to take that white box

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:08,250
implementation with that software stack

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:10,680
276 countries by end of this year so

00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:17,430
really really great work going on by the

00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:20,400
teams so I want to show so why open

00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:25,260
source and I get this a lot and it

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:28,800
really is about making the network much

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,740
more relevant and making the network and

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,280
when you think about 5g something that's

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,920
more accessible to developers to use to

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,300
create you know all these amazing new

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,440
use

00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,290
cases that are going to come down the

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,170
pike here shortly and the fundamental

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,870
tenants of making that a reality making

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:51,740
that network more relevant making it

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:53,990
more programmable is about openness and

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,880
this is really important here and this

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,670
is obviously by the name itself

00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:03,170
literally open sources to draw in

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:05,960
greater communities to solve these and

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:09,680
build these solutions much faster much

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,720
more effectively and in also there's a

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,940
lot of myth out there that says hey is

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,730
open source really safe is it really

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,440
secure and I'm here to tell you actually

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:24,500
open source is more secure is the most

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,720
secure approach to take because when you

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,450
look at a proprietary implementation a

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,270
closed implementation which is really

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:36,980
only controlled by just a few there's a

00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:38,840
much much much more power with a much

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,990
greater community and if you think about

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:45,530
the more eyeballs you can have looking

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:49,000
at the code testing it using it finding

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:53,720
vulnerabilities fixing them immediately

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,270
that's that's really how you get the

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,420
most robust the most secure code out

00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:02,510
there and if you want a testament to

00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:05,960
that you know just look at you know the

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:08,750
most ubiquitous project open source

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,330
project out there and that's Linux in

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,980
fact Linux most people don't realize

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,050
Linux is probably more part of your

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,740
lives your connected lives than we

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:21,560
realize but that project in itself with

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,930
just the global reach and the global

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:30,050
eyeballs looking at that base of code is

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:32,600
constantly being upgraded and checked

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,470
and made better in fact

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:39,140
the Linux kernel is actually patched

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:41,660
nine times every hour so whenever

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,730
there's some little improvement or some

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,940
little issue found it's immediately

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,380
identified and it's corrected and no

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:53,630
where can you get velocity like

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:56,460
at other than having a large community

00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:59,400
aligned on making it better and so

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,169
that's why security is so important and

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:07,020
why we believe open-source is more

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:09,630
secure and then finally but not least we

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:13,110
believe open-source is going to open up

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,090
a whole new level of interoperability so

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:19,520
and again these traditional areas of the

00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:22,799
network that have been very you know

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,890
controlled by a few we're now opening up

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,830
to the power of many and this is where

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,700
we're gonna lower that entry barrier for

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:35,159
innovation so we can get more speed get

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,850
more interesting more disruptive

00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,580
solutions in that can really propel and

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,530
take networking to the next level so I

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,740
think and I hope you agree with me

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:50,309
open-source has a tremendous future and

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:53,039
everything we do and I'm just really

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:55,830
pleased to see so many people jumping on

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,659
this bandwagon and being a part of it so

00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:00,330
that's my talk and I just want to thank

00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:03,320
you again for your contributions your

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,640
participation and support of this

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,490
incredible journey we are we're on

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,470
together and thank you for all that you

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:14,759
do

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,759
