enhancing intelligent application

00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,770
ability generally in becoming AI

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,050
industry in neighborhood with an

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,920
international perspective and a desire

00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,660
for ICT convergence China Mobile

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,450
participates actively in contributes a

00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,060
lot in open source communities faced

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,340
with the next generation network China

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,400
Mobile is introducing open network

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,000
automation platform own ID which is the

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,310
intelligent brain of Sdn NFV to realize

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,530
automatic network orchestration in

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,960
management cmcc

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:49,370
output several influential use cases

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,850
such as vault such as vol de NCC VPN use

00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,440
cases 209 collaborates with other active

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,900
members in the community and

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,630
continuously contributes code to cool

00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,460
projects as the biggest open source

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,400
community in lfn

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,250
o nipe expands rapidly in the last few

00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,030
years only more than 100 members and

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,190
over 70 percent global users by taking

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,990
advantage of the strong orchestration

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,020
ability

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,420
Oh nigh intelligent scheduling agile

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:29,190
deployment dynamic adjustment are

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:32,500
changing into reality okay thank you

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:36,510
thank you for all the support so the

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,850
topic I will cover today as a practice

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,190
where's the title the network

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,510
intelligence and the open source the

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,600
practice and thoughts

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,240
I feel like which ever conference you go

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,810
no matter is speech natural language and

00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,960
which no matter is which industry kind

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,500
of all we all united under artificial

00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,090
intelligence so I feel lucky to be the

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,360
first one to talk I don't need to worry

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,510
about it I'm going to repeat someone

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,270
else's the points so will be two parts I

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,710
will share some practice inside time

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:17,140
oboe also how we see in the industry and

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,550
then our second part I will share some

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,130
of our thoughts

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:26,380
I'm I think is are the things we I think

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:29,260
we can collaborate at all okay if we

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:33,130
look at to the sender organizations

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:36,760
there's tremendous work who recently

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:41,530
done try to put AI into the standards

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,960
from 3gpp from ITU from I and also

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,900
others so without going through the

00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:52,180
details and we can see where the

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:57,820
industry is going so if we look at today

00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:01,480
11 members if you talk to you the top

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,910
way officers the developers are here so

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,820
everyone seems to have some part of to

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:11,770
do with AI and we have a couple keynote

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:14,110
talks on DevOps I'm thinking is we for

00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,840
now and this moment we have invested

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,840
quite a lot on AI ops and its next step

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,290
of a DevOps I think it's no man is the

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,470
webscoe internet companies so tacos or

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,340
vendors are University heavily on AI how

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,280
to use the

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,460
artificial intelligence technology

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,520
operation okay with that

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:41,169
from sto from the industry in general I

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:44,010
give you idea how the AI Rd looks like

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:49,600
in China Mobile what is our strategy so

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:53,320
we don't see us as a kind of core deep

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,750
down technology inventor what are stir

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,560
and drown strategy is driven by value

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,960
because we have been into big data for a

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,910
couple of years I mean we all think big

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,639
data world leads big a value which is

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:10,060
not necessarily to so when we come to

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,790
the era of AI we think it's that we have

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,950
to derive the value of the commercial

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,979
value from the technology so we're value

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:20,500
dream lies strategy we're trying to push

00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:22,950
out to the larger secure applications to

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,979
improve our business improve our

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,100
productivity so come to details so we

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:35,770
have our general platform AI problems

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:37,900
support R&D and production company white

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,789
and then we have the bottom the

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,000
infrastructure for the hardware how

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:46,840
managing the clouds and then have the

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,360
layer a common capabilities on top is

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,870
what do we focus is the three major

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,580
areas is artificial intelligence for a

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,979
network how to make our network

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,800
intelligent and the second part of

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,860
marketing service security and

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,110
management I don't think I will go to

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,530
details but our focus on the first one

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,990
the network just give a couple there

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,870
there tons of work to be done so I'm

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,800
thinking I will just mention what what

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:21,460
how what's the systemic view of that

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,320
work looks like so for networking

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,460
intelligence we'll put into three layers

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:30,400
if you look at the the outside circle

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,770
which the intelligence service you can

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,830
we can do the for example the business

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:39,020
management industry services how we

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:42,560
improve our user satisfaction

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,710
those are service layer we think it's

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,840
easier to do compared to in their ones

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,320
if you look at the middle ones it's

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:55,550
encouraging the operation I think we all

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:59,000
put in quite lots of efforts into this

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,120
lines of business and the core one is

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,080
how we make our Court the the foundation

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,570
of the network intelligent routing

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:15,289
slicing energy how to save energy how we

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:18,139
use AI to make Mac intelligent so given

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:20,090
that overall view and I share a couple

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,740
of things just take a few examples to

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,889
give you a sense of what we did for

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:30,199
example for customer care we have this

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:32,900
chat bot in deployment since 2014 of

00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:37,130
this is a chart how we improved from

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:40,280
last year for now they they robot 100%

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:47,180
to the robot to handle the customer care

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:50,840
volume in 22 almost 23 points % and this

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:54,590
is a we evaluate our this not just the

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,280
accuracy of how we interact with our

00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,500
customers how accurate is more of how

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,370
many channels we put in how much how

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:07,940
many chance we have per month and they

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:10,280
the rejection rate our accuracy how that

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,320
impacts your customer satisfaction

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,539
that's how we evaluate the technology

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,090
Zone on the bottom

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:20,150
it relies on speech recognition you rely

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,210
on sentiment rely on lots of an LP

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,870
natural language processing speech

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:29,210
technology knowledge base data analytics

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,789
and some part of computer vision

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,140
technologies to to integrate everything

00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:38,479
into we have a closed loop circle and

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,500
every single day we have data annotated

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,480
to have the date have our performance

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,510
evaluated and confirmed by human and

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,380
come back and we upgrade the model on

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,840
databases that's the first one give you

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,850
a second example as

00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:00,800
more relevantly to network so we all get

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:05,270
consumer and customer complaints coming

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,460
that's a big warrior of all tacos so

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,590
this one what we did is from the

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,020
customer give us the call we gets the

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,450
speech we transcribe will transcribe

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,750
into text when we analyze the test and

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,810
analyze what's a problem the concern is

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:24,320
will extract all the facts then we can

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,180
buy those and then we that's part of the

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,480
understanding with the users and point

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,330
complain is the second part is we tackle

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,940
in two of the major data we need to

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:38,090
connect with and it's going to analyze

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:41,600
what's the problem is how to solve it so

00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:44,180
basically is we build a network up

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,030
reached maintain this kind of knowledge

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,390
base and we also connects you all the

00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,760
data I have layered here now many of

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,940
them you can imagine they're a heavy

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:59,560
layer of engineering to connect all the

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,840
data points to make the decision smart

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:06,640
this has been deployed in large scale

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,890
and I save us quite a lots of money and

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,910
another one is connected to wireless

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,020
it's in Titanic coverage coverage

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:19,310
optimization this is a back office to

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:21,110
tour used inside try mobile a couple

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,090
other things the for future networker

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,250
next generation they are naturally

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,890
largest go deploy yet just give a couple

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,170
example this one I presented the last

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:34,670
year with Huawei and the waterfall and

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:37,220
the cross layer cross carrier VPN and

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,800
this year we show this tomorrow we are

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:46,910
still partially deployed in China Mobile

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:49,010
is we combine this own app and an AI on

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,890
the edge so basically it's the scenario

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:54,860
as you imagine you have a security

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:58,280
monitoring system that you have yours

00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:02,330
you detect if there is abnormal speech

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:06,020
or signal sound signal and then you if

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,710
there's extreme situations from the from

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,100
the picture

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:14,090
from the from the video and then we

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,400
notify owner and adjust their bandwidth

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:21,410
automatically so it's it's getting a I

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,450
to initiate to the orchid situation so

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,790
Saturday iPhone Network is slicing this

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:29,540
is one of our main thing for for

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,940
developing to prepare for 5g this is a I

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,100
for smart edge without going to details

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,580
I think for this community there are

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:41,360
tons of work in the community and inside

00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,940
each of the companies this we're

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,080
thinking how we can systematically put

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:51,110
an AI into own app for the data analytic

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,270
apart to close the loop so I gave a

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:56,530
couple examples but which is I don't

00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:01,150
think it's an important part of my talk

00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:04,460
so to summarize we have a lot more

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:07,370
hundreds of AI enabled systems functions

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,800
now we have developed and deployed in

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,170
the past couple years to help improve

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,640
the complex network there are too many

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:19,760
just like just give you a sense so

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,160
they're in Chinese that's intentionally

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,880
I want to kiss takes lots of time to

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,210
translate them I don't think there is a

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:32,780
point to showing them so then then what

00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:36,590
was the problem behind we built we spent

00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:39,680
lots of energy and and human resources

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:42,650
building this intelligence system to

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,590
help network we see what do we got

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:48,560
it's a great technology I think is a way

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:52,700
of AI is transforming us is to transform

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,240
in industry so we are also in this

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,680
moment last month last week actually we

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,600
announced that we are hosting a

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,160
nationwide to network intelligence the

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,280
competition in China

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:10,070
so whoever I interested you'll really

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:11,930
welcome to give a try and I think it the

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,210
second part is really I want to share

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,760
with audiences here some of our thoughts

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,040
what we can take what do we have as a

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,520
now for an airway intelligence to the

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,400
next

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:28,010
level so what we should do what is the

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:31,400
problem so first one what is what is a

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:34,430
correct and definition for networker

00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,010
intelligence so even people saying there

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,350
they're not so we all talk about AI but

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,930
everyone's AI is different from others

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,610
so for me I give you my personal

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,150
definition what is the artificial

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,370
application so we can you can have AI

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,410
means lots of technologies you can

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,420
machine learning deep learning transfer

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,680
learning reinforcement learning care

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,760
philosophy learning you can have a

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,710
knowledge base you can have inference

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,180
algorithms anything in the way so when

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,030
you put a indigo everything together

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,370
into an AI based the system the system I

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,280
got to have a feature it can improve

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,050
this itself on its own so I'm thinking

00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,420
and that's it has to be a living thing

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,610
so if you have the system in the

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,550
performance today as one and the

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,400
tomorrow it's or it a week later if it

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:27,170
can become one point zero one it improve

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:29,270
its on tone it has a a sign of as the

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,940
living body it so I'm thinking that that

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,280
kind of application Wakata AI if you

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,500
deploy technology you never touches it

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,230
doesn't improve enter own even it has

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,440
speech recognition even has image

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,720
processing is used AI technology I don't

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,960
think itself is a application so I give

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,850
you a definition of my personal view I'm

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,040
thinking is the way truly need a

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,340
definition from there working height is

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,280
to because there are just too many cases

00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:01,610
scenarios in our business so we can put

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:05,090
into we can use ai ai definitely helps

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:08,300
but there are lots of efforts on kind of

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:12,410
low-level hiding food how can improve

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,960
that it's um it's a I would think if

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,240
this gets clearly defined there will be

00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,340
a big help

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,220
we take the intelligence to the next

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,860
level the second ones that can efforts

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,670
be systematic I show you what we have

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:32,150
done on the transport network on the

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,320
core network around each and the

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,870
operation

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,170
on their services side so so I'm

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,590
thinking where how can make it more

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:47,810
systematic so we can if you compare the

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:50,780
concept you the levels of automatically

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,910
driving cars so you can from the easy to

00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,810
hard what is the level one with the

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,500
level five

00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:01,040
so we're where we are now and the second

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:05,600
way is so we think it's it's the service

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,030
the the operation layer the basic the

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,820
foundation of the network and wireless

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:14,210
two core network well is transporter in

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,130
the core network and we all know for for

00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,650
the tackle industry we need a lots of

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:21,050
planning and we construct our network we

00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,720
operate we optimize the network in

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,790
different phases of us we need a AI to

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,250
come in to help what those AI

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,260
technologies it look like what's the

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:34,820
framework it should be I'm thinking is

00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:36,860
still a open question and when we do AI

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,470
we need the steps you need a sense

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,930
what's the data and it gets the data how

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,660
we can do this same thing right so when

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:47,720
we are proud to against lots of data but

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:50,270
lots of data definitely means a big data

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,040
means a big cost doesn't necessarily

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,640
means a bigger value so how we can

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,650
correctly in a cost effective way to

00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,740
sense our network the qualities for

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,930
network to sense user experience and how

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,260
we practice store the data analyze the

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,600
data and there do the prediction those

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,390
are open questions

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,060
the third question I want hopefully we

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:19,100
all can work together this is what level

00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:21,680
we should share data so we cannot

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:25,449
imagine the data process the image of

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,820
processing the CV the computer vision

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:32,480
technology can come to where it is now

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:35,270
without images data set so we need a for

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,490
AI everyone knows it's it's data to

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,250
generate intelligence the where the data

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,230
come from you what way should come so

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,180
data is issue if you look at their own

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,070
research papers from the networking

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,270
literature you can see a mostly

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,690
researches are you

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,400
you use the data from many years ago

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,560
doesn't read necessarily represent to

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,800
the problem of what do we face in your

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,720
industry so that's a bigger gap there so

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,910
that that's why we hosted as a

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,550
competition in China where you invited

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,830
developers not to share some of our data

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,590
we also you come to our our own

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,780
computing platform you can run your

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,490
things for the big side of the data

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,860
chunk of data you can come to our

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,830
platform to run our computation to try

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,620
things try your own algorithms next

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,870
level is a model you can we all know now

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,140
the intelligence is a narrow sense and

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:29,630
it's not a general intelligence it has

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,180
to course-specific a problem but on the

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,790
model about how we should share well

00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,280
it's pretty hard to share if I have a

00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,650
special competition model I give it to

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,600
you to run recognition prop is it easier

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,630
for network it's we don't know which

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,230
level which problem we can share that's

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,720
a model level another way is for now for

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,240
the last year the big thing is in the AI

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,730
field is Bert the ERT

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,810
the pre train model from Google

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,940
basically is its gets a level of natural

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:05,330
language processing to define a general

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,270
way which can get the meaning of the

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,430
words of the sentence in a way from

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,170
large amount of data and you can take it

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,870
our model the Capri train the model

00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:17,600
basically the catch the basic semantics

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:20,090
of words of sentences then for the all

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,390
the downstream tasks you no matter you

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,640
do sentiment analysis human you to

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,500
customer care dialogue so whatever you

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,380
do you can use this pretty model and

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,610
easily tune for whatever the specific

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:38,360
application is so I'm thinking in the

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:41,270
telecom intelligence world do we have

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,210
this level of abstraction can we build

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:49,190
this kind of model is it possible if so

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:52,250
how we do it so the third level is since

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,950
for networking intelligence if you get

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,560
the data the data is static there are

00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,230
lots of problem needs to that needs a

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,190
environment knowledge data so what our

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,280
environment should be

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:08,390
and should we collectively build that

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,970
one to foes to the research and R&D and

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:13,040
even inside a corporation where that

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,490
amendment should be open to the

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,710
developers the problem obstruction I've

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,510
showed you you can build a millings

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:24,260
hundreds thousands millions of

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:26,450
applications but you cannot handle the

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,700
costs you have to pay so much for

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,520
building those capabilities so I'm

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,800
thinking if we if we look at the typical

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,530
problems of if we do a level ups

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,720
abstraction we get to know what's the

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,970
nature of the day of our problem will

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,460
face the classification it's a decision

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,310
what's the foundation was the nature

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:49,370
basic nature of the problem if we get

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,680
that layer of abstraction I think we

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,440
probably computed something general to

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:58,550
fit all the scenarios versus rebuilding

00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:01,430
one for each so and another way I'm

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,770
thinking is we now we borrow the

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,930
algorithms which originally designed it

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:09,440
to process natural language to pass a

00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:11,780
speech to process images videos but they

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,150
are not fundamentally designed for

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,670
network of problems are they perfectly

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,930
okay for our own problem or we need

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,360
something special

00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,490
you cannot imagine without image

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,160
processing there's no convolutional

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:28,070
neural network now if there's no speech

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,530
there's no ASTM so the problem is itself

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,500
probably can lead to another level of

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:36,440
the invention for for AI I'm running out

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,910
of time so efficient way to improve a

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,280
collaboration between industry and

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,950
academia so I have this I'm seeing this

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,050
really big a gap between what industry's

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,410
doing what your researches professors

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:50,690
are doing on our research is they're

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,510
open source is open source an easy way

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:57,320
for this lab of integration compared to

00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:00,590
the commercial software so quick

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,130
question one share is AI is not only

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:08,330
that piece of technology it impacts our

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,670
own way of we run our business so

00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:13,490
methodology and process to efficiently

00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,830
deploy a I enable function

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,990
mentioned the closed-loop how to make

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,210
your AI system really a living thing

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,850
it's not an only algorithm is not only

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:27,290
theta is your business process has to

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:29,890
close the loop to give it a life and the

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,200
sixth question I want to share is way of

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,690
business and organization how to match

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,880
this new technology every piece of

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:41,059
technology especially I think you will

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,809
transform the way we think and also the

00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:47,630
way we run our we organized our folks

00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:50,809
the last one is I hope our network can

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,500
be simpler and I hope a I a world

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:55,240
healthier

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:58,789
okay that's how my content thank you

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,789
