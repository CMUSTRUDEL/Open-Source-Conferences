Description: 
	Keynote: Accelerating Innovation with Lean NFV - Scott Shenker, Professor of Computer Science, UC Berkeley; Sylvia Ratnasamy, Associate Professor of Computer Science, UC Berkeley & CTO, Nefeli Networks; Constantine Polychronopoulos, VP & CTO, VMware

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology has the potential to revolutionize the networking industry, yet the promise of NFV remains largely unfulfilled. Many NFV efforts today are plagued with complexity across deployment, automation and operation. At the same time, on-boarding virtualized network functions (VNFs) continues to be time-consuming and frustrating. LeanNFV is an open architecture that takes a minimalist approach to integration, enabling superior time-to-market, efficiency and automation. In this keynote, we will describe the impetus behind LeanNFV, what LeanNFV is and how to get involved.
