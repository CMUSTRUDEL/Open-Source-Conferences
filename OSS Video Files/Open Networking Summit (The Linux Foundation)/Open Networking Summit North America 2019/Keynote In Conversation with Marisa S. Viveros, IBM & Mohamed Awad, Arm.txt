so our our next two presenters and

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,859
panelists I would say fireside chat you

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,540
know it's a different format I would

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,110
like to call on stage

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,529
Marissa Viveros from IBM and Mohammed

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,539
Abad from arm on the stage please and I

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:25,890
will let them introduce them please give

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:27,090
them a round of applause all right why

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:33,030
don't you go ahead and introduce

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:36,360
yourself and are paid in the whole

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,840
indistinct milk a grateful to be here

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,320
and thank you for having us in this

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,700
important topic

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,370
so this Maurice Oliveros I lead within

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,710
IBM all of the strategy in solution

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,350
development for the telco and media

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,260
industry this is a significant part of

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,930
the business within IBM and as part of

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,070
my role I believe in with the during the

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,739
past three years all of the the IBM play

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,070
and strategy within never tried to a

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,369
totalization and now telco network cloud

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,850
so this is a very appropriate a team in

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:18,450
in addition to that I'm a member of the

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,820
elephant ball and I just wanted to

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,650
reinforce on IBM has a tremendous

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,060
commitment from open source and

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,799
throughout the presentation and

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,170
throughout this note minister we speak

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,680
here we will see that how that has been

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,570
you note represented within the market

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,420
uh-huh thanks thanks Arthur thanks

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,030
Marisa so my name is mohammad ahmad i

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,950
manage the infrastructure business for

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,270
arm we say infrastructure we mean

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,040
everything from the edge of the network

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,829
all the way into the cloud data center

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,570
and then into HPC you know it's an area

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,180
where we are putting a tremendous amount

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,920
of focus and and really excited about

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,740
the changes happening in the ecosystem

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,100
today all right and while we're on that

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,810
topic

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,869
thank you few slides for you do you mind

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,429
telling us your sure thought process and

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,349
then we'll get into the discussion sure

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,829
okay

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:16,760
so uh you know armed to date has shipped

00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:19,219
over 125 billion processors have shipped

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,620
with armed technology over the last you

00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:23,959
know five or six years more than half

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,430
that number was shipped the point is is

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,939
that's accelerating we're seeing more

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,109
and more devices shipped every year and

00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:34,609
those devices are more more and more

00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:36,680
connected connectivity as a requirement

00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:39,079
to being driven a lot by IOT it's being

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,909
driven a lot by all these smart

00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:44,510
intelligent endpoints looking to put

00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:45,950
data back on the network that's changing

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,419
the way the infrastructure works we're

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,790
moving from an infrastructure where

00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,949
which has primarily been driven and

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,269
designed around pushing data out from

00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:55,400
the core of a data center out to

00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,810
billions of people you know with phones

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,419
in their hands watching those you know

00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,900
cat videos on Facebook or YouTube or

00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,209
whatever

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,480
alright 70% of that data traffic is

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:07,189
video today but in the world of a

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,829
trillion devices which we believe will

00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,120
will happen you know that model changes

00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:13,219
significantly and I want to just go

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,709
through one quick example if we talk

00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:17,180
about an HD video sensor a billion HD

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,799
video sensors so in a world of a

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,169
trillion devices you could imagine that

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,209
a billion of those devices are HD video

00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:26,030
sensors not unlike your nest video

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,729
camera at home a billion HD video

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,819
sensors would generate about 400

00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:33,709
exabytes of monthly bandwidth 400

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:37,009
exabytes of monthly bandwidth is about

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,689
three times the total Internet bandwidth

00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,579
today total Internet bandwidth today is

00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:43,579
about a hundred and fifty exabytes so a

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,609
billion HD video sensors would swamp the

00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:49,579
current infrastructure would take over

00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:51,799
40 million servers to to manage all that

00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:54,319
data that's more than the entirety of

00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,519
the idea of AWS cloud the point that I'm

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,409
trying to make here is that the

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,759
infrastructure is changing as more and

00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:01,489
more of these devices get on the

00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,500
infrastructure how we think about the

00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:08,620
infrastructure and the network has to

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:11,209
change ultimately what it means is that

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,650
all along the path whether it be that

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,840
end point all the way up to the cloud

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,280
and every point in between data will

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,989
have to be filtered it will have to be

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,789
analyzed and have to be processed this

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,980
is changing the underlying compute

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,420
platform all the way across no long

00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,430
can we rely on one centralized

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,840
general-purpose compute at the center of

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,640
the data center to do all of that

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,780
compute and routing and traffic

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,950
management it's gonna have to happen

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,050
everywhere what open source does is it

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,120
leads the way for that modularity and

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,830
portability it leads the way so that an

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,710
application developer doesn't have to

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,000
worry about you know where his

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,410
application is running he all he needs

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,810
to worry about is what is the latency

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,970
what is the bandwidth and what is the

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,130
the compute is my service provider than

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,040
a live up to those expectations and that

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,990
workload can then migrate across a vast

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,550
array of different devices and platforms

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,920
all throughout that infrastructure

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,270
whether it be at the end point at the

00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,100
edge or into the cloud we've seen this

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,800
happen already we've seen people go off

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,530
and make decisions where they go off and

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,410
optimize different areas of that stock

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,050
whether it be whether it be open source

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,790
software in the middle which enables

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,320
which enables a vendors to go off and

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,180
create customized hardware which can

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,770
drive more and more acceleration at the

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,570
lowest levels we saw that was with

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,450
Amazon where they're doing their own

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,130
custom cores now on custom silicon but

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,650
the application developer who sits on

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,330
top doesn't matter to them and that's

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,920
really the point the point is is that

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,110
you can get more customization you can

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,210
get more acceleration you can get more

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,220
efficiency by creating fit for purpose

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,840
Hardware underneath fit for purpose

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,520
devices all the way throughout and

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,230
workloads can move from one end to the

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,670
other we're seeing this happen more and

00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,320
more and it really is the only way that

00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,240
we're going to be able to live up to the

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,650
demands of this next generation trillion

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,720
device infrastructure thank you all

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,970
right Marissa just the same way we

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,790
thought it would be good to have some

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,070
slides I know you know a panel typically

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,620
if you just keep talking then it you

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:13,610
know you'll be on the phone so this is a

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:17,720
better idea okay so let me just give you

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,910
a little background so in case for the

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,090
for a lot of you attached to nano I

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:26,630
being works with about 84% of the

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:30,530
largest providers across the world that

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:33,020
work it is across helping them you know

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,729
really become intimate are organizations

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,219
and what I mean digital array

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:40,069
is not realized in different processes

00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:42,860
their support processes how they deal

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:45,349
with trillions I ain't in a part of that

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,210
equation is the network I will say the

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:49,819
fundamental part of that equation is the

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,099
network the for you know digitizing the

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,770
network and making the network software

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:58,279
if we come in - no more important than

00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:00,710
ever our tweet asked us to look at no

00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,300
business models here you know how does

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,529
ecosystem business models are changing

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:09,009
in this new environment and I thought I

00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:13,789
start by saying you know we did a survey

00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:15,949
in the about six months ago and we

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,240
interview about 200 executives

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,430
throughout the world these are all

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,270
telecom executives half of them are

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:26,059
three level xx what so we asked how

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,759
important is open source for them open

00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:31,789
standards open source inter evolution or

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,399
any other other business as well as the

00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,649
lifecycle automation of services that

00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,740
are being deployed as you can see from

00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:42,469
the distance on their results here you

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,330
know customizing it is very important so

00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:46,490
becoming the flexibility and the agility

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,189
to provide new services in their

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:53,449
environment becomes critical the second

00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:57,620
area is lower development cost and that

00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:59,779
means really tap into the sheer R&D that

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,209
is happening with open source in order

00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,309
to get the economy of scales be more

00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:07,330
agile and development on your service is

00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:11,330
in a faster manner for me one of the key

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,110
no findings here is faster

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,870
time-to-market

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,240
I think every one of the operators what

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,339
they want is the first time to market

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,459
that agility to bring new services to

00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:25,159
test services in an agile manner in an

00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:27,259
MPP not and in a Minimum Viable Product

00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,120
manner you know taste you know look at

00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,580
whether it is successful and then go

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,019
back and rework if it needs refinement

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,919
but these are some of the

00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:39,380
characteristics and why operators are

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,500
looking at in willing to adopt open

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,170
source within interoperability again

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,720
becomes a crease critical element of

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:51,350
that open source adoption

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,570
so these are the areas that I think as

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,400
technologies in a stochastic as the

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,250
fasting a community here we're all

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,070
working on what I like to shift a little

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,520
bit our focus and I said shift focus in

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:07,130
a really mean balanced focus from

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,760
infrastructure to service delivery I

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:15,110
think I serve as a community we need to

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,640
pay attention to the network and how we

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,460
build the network in a software

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,010
environment we need to pay attention of

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,530
how we know tap into the multi cloud

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,170
environment that everybody is is looking

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,210
at right now shall we tap in into

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:32,690
machine learning ai and all of the new

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:35,120
technologies that are available not just

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:38,390
for the sake of technology but for the

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,640
idea to provide that extremely good user

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,200
experience to the in services so that's

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,010
called acquire operate what the

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,900
operators want from us as a community as

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,180
companies provide a great experience

00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:55,040
furthermore bring that great user

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:57,610
experience into verticals know the

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,860
revenues that are being produced from

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,630
consumers those we all know that those

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,550
are declining on a daily basis

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,310
throughout the world

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:11,390
you know operators need to tamp into you

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:14,150
know how do they tap into IOT in other

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,040
technologies and in knowledge in tan Phi

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,520
G in order to provide those new

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,920
solutions for enterprises in integrated

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,380
transform you know healthcare retail

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
energy and utilities you know you name

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,310
if you know all of the industries are

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,160
there to be changed by this vast

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,110
availability of bandwidth lower latency

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,010
with industry network so pay attention

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,380
to not only the infrastructure but also

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,150
you know how we drive down from a

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,700
service delivery perspective and what

00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,200
services we want to deploy I think

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,500
that's fascinating the two things I

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,660
really like is capex is not in the top

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,120
three meaning you know coming from a

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,900
vendor myself all my life right I really

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,620
feel good that open source is not

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,720
killing a business model for vendors

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,670
it's clear from your participation and

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,850
your increased contribution there's

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,999
money to be made and what the end users

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,759
are after is not you know cheap they're

00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:13,230
after innovation they're after time to

00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,730
market you know flexibility

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,740
customization so that's that's a good

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,480
and the second thing I picked up which

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,269
was really good was the service delivery

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,329
or the service experience aspect I think

00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:26,490
we heard our McGann yesterday who also

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:30,180
stretched our imagination saying that's

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:33,809
kind of what the CX o people are looking

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:38,160
at and so for us and the networking deep

00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:40,019
dive land for us a user experience is

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,449
basically you know we get very excited

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,670
when we move from CLI to a GUI right

00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:46,199
let's be honest it's like oh wow you

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,290
know we don't have to do CLI that's GUI

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,579
that's user experience has gone up right

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,170
take that and stretch it ten times

00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,309
that's not real - you're talking about

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,160
all right

00:11:53,309 --> 00:12:00,839
so with that let me go through a few

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,509
questions the first one Mohammed we're

00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,459
in a world of heterogeneous compute okay

00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:10,290
and that could be from the cloud to the

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:13,019
devices and how do you how do you guide

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,199
you know your company as well as the

00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,459
ecosystem to kind of balance you know on

00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:20,069
one hand it's interoperability

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:22,829
compatibility standardization and the

00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:25,559
other hand is differentiation so what

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:27,720
are your thoughts on that yeah I mean at

00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,490
the end of the day you know you can have

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,559
heterogeneous compute but it can still

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,449
exist within a standardized framework

00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:36,120
and I think that's really what what is

00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:37,559
required and really what what drives you

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,600
know in many cases all new business

00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:42,240
models in and of itself right being able

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,309
to to manage multiple different pieces

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,230
of hardware you know whether it's that

00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:48,809
ruggedized end node which is in a power

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,370
constrained environment or that big HPC

00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,050
server which is sitting in the core the

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,699
data center being able to manage those

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,829
two and then quickly deploy workloads

00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:57,689
from one end of your infrastructure to

00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:00,170
the other becomes you know in it of

00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:02,879
itself a challenge and and we are seeing

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,100
companies and products merge to kind of

00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,079
go address those things I think the key

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,569
is and one of the most important pieces

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,600
of it is having that standardized open

00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:15,269
source software in the middle and name

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,339
the or puts the onus on the developer of

00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,260
the particular pieces of hardware or the

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,480
software to ensure that interoperability

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,370
across the board you know arm we

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,860
contributed over a hundred open-source

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,050
just within the infrastructure business

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,029
unit over a hundred open-source standard

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,940
projects and we do that specifically to

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,490
ensure that you know an ARM based server

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,500
world will will will work as seamlessly

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,930
as you know a server based on some other

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,670
architecture okay yeah so essentially

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,740
what you're saying is keep the plumbing

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,440
level common exactly hate to use that

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,570
word but that's the reality right so the

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,940
plumbing level is common layer is common

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,230
that's based on open source and then you

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,060
add your customization and

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,260
differentiation that's right and because

00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,970
it's open source it can quickly be

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,130
modified and adapted to ensure that it

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,320
stays calm yeah and it's it's you know

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,779
it's no coincidence that you know we

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,149
have we have the two ends of the stack

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,310
on a panel right if you look at and we

00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:10,350
are all networking folks always stacks

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:14,070
right he's at the bottom of the stack

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,110
right no rights and chipped and she's at

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,380
the top of the stack services right

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,630
things like that so how do you see you

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,870
know innovation like he would prefer

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,089
things to be common at the hardware API

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,220
abstraction OS device driver kind of

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:32,220
that level you would like to see it at

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,040
the services layer at the OSS BSS layer

00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:38,940
so how do you think you know innovation

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,790
and interoperability can be balanced you

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,860
know the I think it the previous panel

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,570
the decorator of in the federal

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,920
community is doing a great job at the

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,690
standards so while we do work at the

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,390
upper layers of the stack no oh it says

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,640
VSS as well as the business services

00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,070
that are being delivered we trust that

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,779
there will be a common infrastructure

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:04,980
that would allow our triose to innovate

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:08,339
faster so I I think this is really that

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:11,490
ecosystem and that it really needs to

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:14,519
work together and for me is sometimes we

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,800
are you know comparators sometimes we're

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,699
partners but that you know it continues

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,040
to be more and more you know inter you

00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:25,080
know interlaced because because we

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,180
really need to provide not

00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,399
the software needs to run on some

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,529
hardware yeah yeah it's known and no

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,320
matter how much we dream the software

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:36,060
would never not run on air so the car

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,279
will be there to stay and we need to

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,130
have it right but that not having that

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,470
common infrastructure at the lower cost

00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,240
that will enable in India agility to

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,149
have the ability to have new services

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,160
like a scalar ratios and all of those

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:52,589
are needed yeah can you give a few

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,260
examples of some of the values that have

00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:58,560
been created in the ecosystem you know

00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,959
for the end users so one of the key

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:06,630
examples that we have been working with

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,410
in IBM is one with water fun and with

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,769
what I found

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,899
in Europe we are doing several projects

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:17,640
one of them is we're working with them

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,920
in defy G Milan bismuth in their there

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,220
are about a hundred companies that have

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,380
come together to enable working with the

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,810
Italian government and not really a

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,720
sponsor by the Italian government

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:32,220
working to create an environment where

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,470
we have the infrastructure but new

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,000
services can be the labor so if you go

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,770
to the website you will see about a

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,959
hundred companies dealing from

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,570
healthcare companies insurance companies

00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,089
you know all of the technologies all of

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,470
the service integrators are there all of

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,740
the network equipment providers are

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:53,459
there as well as know the ship providers

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,020
so it's not very very amazing how these

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:57,839
companies are all working together in

00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,450
bring in that unison and accelerating

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,279
defy G deployment within this very nice

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:05,100
very has any examples from your

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,250
perspective on either end user value

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,530
created in a customer or in a project

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,699
that that comes to mind from I'm sure

00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,949
there's like hundreds of yeah there's

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,679
you know I think one that I gave earlier

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,360
was the you know the AWS Gravitron yeah

00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,919
announcement where they did which you

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,480
know in that case what they did is you

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,220
know because of all the work that was

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,410
done on the open source side they were

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,240
basically able to go off and create

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,090
their own silicon with custom

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,370
acceleration in there which then can go

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,440
you know be transparent to the

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,210
application developers but can provide a

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,330
45 percent you know and this is what

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,710
they say 45 percent cost word

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,139
as opposed to other architectures right

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,769
okay one thing we have not talked about

00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:47,090
a lot is the barriers and specifically I

00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:49,419
want to point out that some of the

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,129
larger operators have people they have

00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:55,490
vendors that they can you know choke

00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:58,669
their necks etc what about the smaller

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:02,149
end users right how do we service them

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:04,580
what can this community do to help drive

00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:07,340
that any ideas there maybe I'll start

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,960
with you yes so in my experience in

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,559
working with operators you know

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,539
throughout the last couple of years in

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,870
specifically on the core transformation

00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:19,549
I see the larger operators and even you

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,570
know I think I can come on with my

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:25,220
fingers and the operators that do have a

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,740
engineering stuff that they do have

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,629
developers and they can rely on - into

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,480
adopting open source testing and

00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:35,870
validating which ones are good for them

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,230
what I see is a huge gap between those

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:41,360
and the rest of the wall where there is

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,570
no engineering resources where they are

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,330
so scarce that I think it we as a

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,389
community need to simplify what this

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,100
should be adopting so providing you know

00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:55,009
componentry that they can easily adopt

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,139
but I think that is also in thinking

00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:59,360
about the topic is I think if we can do

00:18:57,139 --> 00:19:02,360
also you know ourselves you know we can

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,549
be ambassadors to college universities

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,230
and start bringing that team and

00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:08,840
bringing the knowledge into those new

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,879
talent I think that we can harvest from

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,789
and then create a next generation

00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:17,450
pipeline that can help I don't bring to

00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:19,279
where those bring two very nice and and

00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,840
one last round and I know

00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,529
we're gonna run out of time but on

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,809
security I know this is at the guts of

00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:29,029
the system that is extremely critical

00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:31,279
and I know you're doing everything in

00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:34,009
your power including collaboration with

00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:37,009
your competitors in the space to make

00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:38,929
sure that security is well address I

00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,460
know we don't we will not have time to

00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,960
go through it but give us a few sound

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,759
bites on yeah I mean I think the thing

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,110
about security it's an important topic

00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,909
much more than I'm gonna be able to

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,210
cover in a couple minutes here but you

00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:51,539
know it starts at the bit and byte level

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,519
transcends the device

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,989
Krauss architectures acceleration all

00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,970
the way up to the service level and then

00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:58,499
all the way from the device all the way

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,029
back to that core that data center and

00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,649
you know at arm that's the kind of the

00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:03,509
way that we think about it we've done

00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:05,369
things like you know PSA and trustzone

00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:08,039
but we don't just think about it at the

00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,840
device level we actively look at what

00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,519
does it mean from you know the device

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,809
all the way back to that core the data

00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,789
center how do we tie all that together

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:17,669
so that we can create you know a uniform

00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:18,809
amount of suit okay so a holistic thing

00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:20,129
happened you have to take a holistic

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:21,419
view of security it's ruin quite a lot

00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:23,639
of standardization it's gonna require a

00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,080
lot of collaboration both with us and

00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,129
then you know quite candidly with our

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,619
competitors to make sure it's done right

00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:33,570
awesome in in Mohammed we had no

00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:35,879
security a trust transparency is a key

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,499
attributes that every before well sir

00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:39,659
well very good with that I think we're

00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:41,460
out of time but really appreciate your

00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,869
insights and you know thank you for the

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,200
support please give a big round of

00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:45,200
