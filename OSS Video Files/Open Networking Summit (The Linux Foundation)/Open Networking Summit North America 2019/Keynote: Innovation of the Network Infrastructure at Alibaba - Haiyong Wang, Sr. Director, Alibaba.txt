	Keynote: Innovation of the Network Infrastructure at Alibaba - Haiyong Wang, Senior Director, Alibaba Group

Alibaba is one of the largest Internet companies in the world. It offers a wide range of services, including ecommerce, financial services, logistics and public cloud services. Running these services demands the network to provide stability, performance and scalability with extremely high standards. Building our own network infrastructure is an essential step to tackle these challenges. It also gives us the ability to customize the network for our diversified workloads. In this talk, we will share our journey of building our network infrastructure, what we have done, lessons learned and the future of our network.

good afternoon Alibaba is one of the

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,160
largest international companies in the

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,860
world network infrastructure is critical

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,840
to the success of the business in this

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,580
talk I will share our journey of

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,580
building our own network infrastructure

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,710
it started a couple years back as the

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,199
Alibaba ecommerce business become hugely

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,710
successful we also got a lot of DDoS

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,420
attacks our commercial vendors devices

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,690
cannot handle the level of attack that

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,160
we experienced as a result we decided to

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,719
build our own solution to do that with

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,360
you to a high performance a package of

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,300
prospecting platform using chrono bypass

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,190
technology DDoS protection with the

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,809
Builder and help the on top of the

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,510
platform with our homegrown solution we

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,390
were able to provision Terrell bps of

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,789
DDoS protection capacity with customize

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:11,569
the protection logic it was not possible

00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:14,520
with vendor devices as the size of our

00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:17,940
infrastructure group we decided to build

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,770
our own switch because when they're

00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,569
switched the were expensive and elected

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,530
the transparency and the customization

00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:28,380
we needed we started with white box

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,789
which hardware from the market and a

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,280
better network OS over the time we

00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:37,860
expand as a hardware supporter to more

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,630
switch Hardware building our net own

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,340
network us which he was a first-hand

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,729
experience of the switch internal

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,340
however a closed stores network OS was

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,920
difficult for us to choose the network

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,310
hardware we won't hit it this God has a

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,310
thinking about what the alternatives are

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,640
it was on a 16 we started at deploy

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,700
cater with servers with 180 connect this

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,340
key was a significant performance boost

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,140
compared to the 10 gig and 40 gig annex

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,689
we also expanded a platform to support

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,340
more applications like a load balancer

00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,340
and virtualization gate away

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,470
leveraging our expertise in chrono bajas

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,000
we peel the high-performance a user mode

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,470
a networking stack and what to switch

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,390
compared to the world compared to the

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,370
kernel version which was switch our user

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,650
model one can keep you cloud customers

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,600
more than table through footer and over

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,600
ten times the reduction in the latency

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,600
on the switch side we announced the join

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,140
sonica projector two years ago at this

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,500
conference

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:54,959
does anyone still remember that for the

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,090
key to a cider we released the 400 agita

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,090
with server which can process more than

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:06,690
400 million packets per second this is

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:08,580
an incredibly powerful gateway 2018 is

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,770
an exciting year because we brought in

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,000
lots of customized the hardware to our

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:17,610
network our smattering can provide us

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,530
close to para mental performance while

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,459
free up the cpu from networking a

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,900
storage IO RDMA of load the track the

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,330
inheritance for the stack to the

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,980
hardware this key was much better

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,640
performance and significantly lower

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,130
latency last year we announced a high

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,690
performance block storage productor that

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,880
can deliver over 1 million

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,610
I will per second through a single disk

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,440
and that our DMA is a key enabler of

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:48,840
this product well our DMA well for many

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,570
amazing performance benefits its APS are

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,610
very different from the socket to help

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,500
the adoption build a communication

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,330
library that is easy to use while

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,850
offering the performance advantage of

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:06,180
the hardware the momentum of our switch

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,820
environment continues we bring up it a

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,650
new switch hardware this enable us

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,420
computer inherited standard networker

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:19,350
using our own switch software and

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:21,900
hardware for the Gateway we got well we

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,820
got incredible performance from our kid

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,440
who disturbers we know that we're

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,470
approaching the end of the service a

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,080
solution to keep up with the server the

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,849
traffic growth

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,360
we developed a new generation gateway

00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:38,389
platform using programmable ASIC with a

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,789
new platform a single device can deliver

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:49,340
a terribie PS reporter with the Sabra

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:50,810
microsecond latency in summary alibaba's

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,050
that was hit by the workload and the

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,729
hyper skill services give enormous

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,270
challenge to the network infrastructure

00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:01,099
at the same time it also offer a great

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,830
opportunity for us to to develop to the

00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:05,419
best infrastructure technology we

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,979
believe building our own network

00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,650
infrastructure is critical to the

00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:11,599
success of the business our journey

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,490
started with moving from vendor

00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:16,310
solutions to building our own solution

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,240
on commodity hardware with the end of

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,419
the Moore's law

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,879
we started making another transition to

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,800
specialize networking how hard work to

00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,930
keep up with the performance demanded by

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,930
