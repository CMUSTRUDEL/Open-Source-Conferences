	00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:09,980
so thank you outfit and good afternoon

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,259
everyone

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,379
so I'm going to give you a quick update

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,770
on what open networking foundation has

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,950
been doing for last year or more and

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:27,300
also tell you that in the process of

00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:30,540
kind of driving Sdn NFV with

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,180
disaggregation and open source we ended

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,420
up kind of inventing or creating a

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,629
unique open-source model that we call

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,000
curated open source and I will try to

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,749
both tell you what we have been doing

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,019
and then also try to tell you why and

00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:51,570
how we ended up inventing this unique

00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:55,469
open source model that we call curated

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,170
open source ok so the first thing is

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,420
that I hope you all know that open

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,890
networking foundation's mission has been

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:08,580
to help network operators transform

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:13,080
their infrastructure and services and

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:17,100
the idea is to help operators bring lot

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:22,170
more capex and OPEX efficiencies as well

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:25,050
as help network operators in print new

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,480
revenue generating services on top of

00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,800
that infrastructure under F which which

00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,400
the city of AT&T

00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,160
keeps saying that I want to turn my

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,250
network infrastructure into a platform

00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,560
for innovation and a platform for

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,690
innovative services and that's what we

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,850
are trying to do and the way we are

00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:50,670
trying to do this is by pushing Sdn and

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,600
NFV clarification as innovative

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:58,830
architectures forward but in addition to

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,490
that using leveraging disaggregation and

00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:05,970
white boxes and open source so what is

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,509
important to recognize about onf and the

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:13,019
mission we are after is we are not only

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:15,780
about open source we are not only about

00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:17,420
Sdn or we are not only about

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,540
disaggregation we

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,849
strongly believe that if we are going to

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,580
bring about this transformation and if

00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:28,280
we are going to help operators succeed

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,140
in this transformation we have to drive

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,260
all these three things

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:36,290
Sdn nfe architectural II we have to push

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,930
for desegregation to bring the economies

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,360
and all that and we have to push for

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,760
open source and when we drive all of

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,489
these things together that is how we can

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,780
bring about this transformation but now

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:53,330
when you look at if you want to drive

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,840
disaggregation open source Sdn nfe

00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:59,930
together what that leads to is you

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,750
transform a network either today the

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,950
network a future network built using

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:09,019
closed proprietary boxes to something

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,560
like this where you are building this

00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:15,319
infrastructure with simpler forwarding

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,030
devices built with merchants silicon and

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:22,700
white boxes the Sdn and the nfe control

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,100
plane that is recurrent realized using

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,400
you can call network operating system

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,040
and then on top of that you have network

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,620
and management control applications you

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,959
have virtual network functions you may

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,030
have services and all of that and that

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,750
is what you build on top of this

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,299
infrastructure now what I want to

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,820
emphasize is like when we are doing this

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:47,720
disaggregation and bringing open source

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,690
and NFV

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,450
we are not only talking about doing it

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,900
to package switches in data centers we

00:03:53,450 --> 00:04:00,560
are bringing this approach to open line

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,049
systems or olt for broadband access that

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,630
is how you build upon X G spawn and

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:08,060
these networks for broadband access we

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,850
are bringing the same approach to radio

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,810
access network with disaggregation with

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:17,660
our udu and bringing this to the 4G and

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,269
5g networks and we are trying to do the

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,120
same thing with the optical networks

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:26,270
optical transport networks with open

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,650
line systems and disaggregated rotom's

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,240
okay now when we look at all of this

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,699
together

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,850
I hope you recognize that this

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:39,940
represents a major major disruptive

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:42,970
innovation in some sense okay and this

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,240
is a disruptive innovation for network

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,550
architecture and more importantly this

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,460
is a disruptive innovation for the

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:55,150
business model of networking industry of

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,690
last 4050 years and when you think about

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:02,710
it that way you are not surprised that

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:05,530
most of our leading OEMs find it very

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,990
difficult to decide how to deal with

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,380
this disruptive innovation should they

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,610
embrace it if they embrace it that means

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,849
they are going to cannibalize their

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,520
products and revenues of today ok and so

00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:24,780
not surprisingly we find it difficult to

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,580
get developers committed to our

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,479
platforms and solution from the leading

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,009
OEMs because today most of the

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:37,780
developers in the networking industry

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:40,180
are in these OMS ok and what that means

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,180
is that we have found it difficult to

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,599
build developer communities around our

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,150
open-source platforms and solutions so

00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:52,900
what that meant is open networking

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:55,870
foundation and our operators ended up

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,690
creating inventing a new open-source

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,870
model that we call curated open source

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,729
and curated communities ok and that is

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,009
how we have been building some amazing

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,800
open source platforms and solutions but

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,199
before I get to them let me tell you

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,740
what we mean by curated open source and

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,050
curated open source communities so let's

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:22,060
begin with the operators so when you

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:24,250
think about AT&T Deutsche Telekom entity

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,800
China Unicom these are some of the

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,250
operators that we work with these are

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,630
the operators that operate owned and

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,419
operates are not the largest

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,610
infrastructure in the world they are all

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,349
committed to the transformation I was

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,940
talking about transforming that

00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:42,940
infrastructure so they can build it with

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:47,030
disaggregation open-source Sdn

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:49,520
vnf and all of that okay now these are

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,770
the operators that know how they are

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,000
going to go through this transformation

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,979
what are the use cases that are

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,620
important to them what are the

00:06:54,979 --> 00:07:00,440
priorities for them and so that is why

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,440
we start with them and then with these

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,780
operators we decide what are the

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,210
particular solutions particular use

00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,250
cases that we are going to focus on and

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,010
that is what they are the ones that

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,280
prioritize what is important and what is

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:20,660
onf and this community should pursue

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,789
okay then we have ons and an engineering

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,520
team so we have a team of maybe 30

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:28,280
people that are part of Open Networking

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,410
foundation sometimes our board members

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,199
and others in the industry have

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,800
described this team of 30 people a small

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,229
and mighty team and the interesting

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,250
thing is that this team has no legacy to

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:45,350
protect they are not of trying to push

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,599
particular agenda except the mission

00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,330
that we are after and so they are able

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,940
to pursue disruptive architectures

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,880
disruptive solutions with lot of passion

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,800
and number of times we have them done

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,410
things then people said this is

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,539
impossible to do or this is crazy to do

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:06,639
and that is the kinds of things we have

00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:10,160
done again and again with our platform

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,250
then another important thing is now

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,789
operators also bring a supply chain

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,530
partners into this ecosystem and Dean of

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,289
the supply chain partners that are

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:24,949
committed to this mission mission of

00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:28,400
disaggregation the mission of fdn NFV

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,900
and open source so once these supply

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,510
chain partners are part of this

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,599
ecosystem then they work closely with

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,669
the operators they work on platforms and

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,380
solutions that the operators care about

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,500
and operators want to take it into

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,690
deployment as a result they don't have

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,790
to do a lot of guesswork about what

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,130
operators want and what operators are

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,640
going to deploy they are working hand in

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:56,290
hand with the operators okay as a result

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,990
for these supply chain partners there is

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,689
significant benefit in terms of reduced

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,550
time to market and because the supply

00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:06,490
chain partners are complementary with

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,749
each other that is they are not

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,209
competing head-on or they are working

00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:14,439
together they also realize lot of

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:17,420
benefits of shared rnd and that is

00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:19,040
significantly reduce rnd costs for

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,399
creating these platforms and solutions

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,829
that operators are wanting to deploy so

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,220
in some sense this is kind of what we

00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:30,800
mean by this curated open-source model

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,009
and the community that we have been

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,379
building now here in the community that

00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:39,679
it looks like follow all the reasons I

00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:42,259
mentioned it's not surprising that we

00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,899
have our top operator these are our

00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:47,389
board members these are the people that

00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,339
own and operate the network they know

00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:51,529
what the strategic priorities ought to

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,420
be and they provide the strategic

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,610
direction and guidance to open

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,160
networking foundation these are the

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,740
supply chain partners that the operators

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,959
have recruited and they work together to

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,319
create these platforms and solutions

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,389
that the operators want to take it into

00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:11,149
deployment of course we extend this

00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:13,309
value proposition to many more operators

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,769
that are members of onf and our

00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:18,410
ecosystem and on top of that we have

00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:20,660
supply chain people and the

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:24,529
collaborators so this ecosystem is

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,959
approximately 150 160 companies but this

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:30,139
is how this ecosystem works which is

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,029
kind of unique in open source and how we

00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:35,389
do things okay

00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:37,639
so that was all about our mission how we

00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:40,579
operate how this curated open source

00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,499
model is now let me quickly walk you

00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,540
through what are the open source

00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:47,600
platforms and solutions that we have

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,559
been building for last few years so let

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,799
me begin with stratum so if you take a

00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,569
packets which a white box pockets which

00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:59,990
stratum is the thin switch operating

00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:02,720
system that sits on top of the the white

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,379
box packets which for example and it

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,420
supports these fdn interfaces we call

00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:09,850
them next

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,300
Sdn interfaces that is beyond open flow

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,260
so supports like p4p for runtime open

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:20,170
config GN mi G Noi and I will talk about

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,750
that in just a minute more similar to

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,810
stratum we have another open source

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:29,440
platform that we call Volta it is the

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:32,530
again a thin software layer that creates

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,100
the open flow abstraction or a uniform

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:39,340
hardware abstraction on top of variety

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,340
of olt devices that make up the Jeep on

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,650
and the broadband access networks ok so

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,400
again you have an uniform open flow

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,570
abstraction on this particular device

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,670
similarly we have built an excellent

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,730
controller that does the same thing

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,130
makes radio access network a

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,070
desegregated radio access network that

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,820
is Sdn enable and on top of that you can

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,230
build services and similarly we use

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,440
disaggregated open line systems and

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:12,400
rodents and then on top of that we use

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,110
on us at the Sdn controller or you can

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,570
think of that as an SDN network

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,880
operating system and that is designed

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,570
for scale performance and high

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,660
availability and then on top of that we

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:29,470
have this open source disaggregated and

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:33,960
virtualized EPC thanks to Intel and

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:36,640
sprint we got this release 13 compliant

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,580
implementation is again disaggregated

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,740
and virtualized and this is the almost

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:46,000
production ready that is going into

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,220
production in sprint and dt sometime

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,090
later this year ok

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:55,720
and then on top of that we build a

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,400
variety of services and these you can

00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,350
think of them as virtual network

00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,440
functions you can think of them as

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,560
services but we have a portfolio of 30

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,590
or so services that are a part of this

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,410
portfolio and then finally we have a

00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,690
platform that we call X OS so this is

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,050
the platform that is you can think of it

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,360
as a service operating system or a

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,360
platform that does service lifecycle

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,850
management

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,950
service composition and putting service

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,250
graphs or service measures together and

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,660
managing those services so for a second

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,000
if you look at this particular software

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,560
stack that we have built you can see

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,779
this is the software stack that you can

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,510
take it into broadband access you can

00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:42,320
take that into mobile wireless packet

00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:45,860
core and much more and now this is only

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,010
the half of the story because now the

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,010
challenges on one hand to do the

00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:54,500
innovation you do need this aggregation

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,620
and this open source platform but when

00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,170
it comes to deployment the operators do

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,940
want integrated solutions they don't

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,670
want disaggregated component there are

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,829
very very few operator that can afford

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,810
to take all the disaggregated component

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:10,970
put it together and deploy that in the

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,100
production network so you do need

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,130
integrated solution and that represents

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,160
a challenge and that's what onf kind of

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,140
because of the requirement we kind of

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,630
stepped up to create some integrated

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,029
solutions as well and let me briefly

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,750
tell you about some of them so the first

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:32,930
one is what we call trellis as the NFB

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,810
fabric ok and so what that particular

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:38,089
solution does it brings together open

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:41,120
flow lightbox pitches okay those are

00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:43,070
kind of what I already mentioned they

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,170
may be right now they may be running oft

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,380
PA but in the future they will run

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,440
stratum on top of that ona's as the

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,269
network operating system or Sdn control

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,230
plane and then there are set up

00:14:53,269 --> 00:15:00,470
application that turn this into a

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:02,420
distributed leaf spine fabric ok and the

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,390
good news here is that there is a Tier

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,029
one operator in the US that has already

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,640
deployed this distributed leaf spine

00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,649
fabric into the production network in

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,890
multiple geographies and that is

00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,890
carrying traffic from many I mean

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,149
thousands of live customers and if you

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,750
look at their plan they are going to

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:25,880
scale it to many many geographies in

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,750
2019 and there are plans to deploy that

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:32,930
in some other operator networks as well

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,770
the second solution that integrated

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,620
solution that

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:39,680
we have enabled is something called Seba

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,850
it stand for Sdn enable broadband access

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:47,120
okay and this is kind of bringing Sdn to

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:50,000
the Japan area spawn and some of these

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,740
broadband access networks where we bring

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,930
in this solution we have being again

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,270
open flow enable switches white box

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:59,690
switches the OLT devices that I

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:03,140
mentioned to you that run volta on the

00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:05,900
top and become part of Sdn and then of

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,180
course oh NASA the operating system X OS

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,400
and nominal set of services this

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,490
software stack that is sitting on top of

00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,800
these devices also provides F caps

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,320
capability that all the operators want

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,460
and then this software stack integrates

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,730
with the OSS BSS of the operators and

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,860
here AT&T Deutsche Telekom talk telecom

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,010
telefonica are some of the operators

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,260
that have publicly stated that they are

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,330
doing trials with this and they have

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:40,070
plans to take this into production in

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:42,110
2019 and beyond the next solution that

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,030
we are building is you can think of that

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,760
we haven't picked the name yet we

00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:49,760
informally call this next generation Sdn

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,790
stack and again it begins with white box

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,560
switches and stratum and as I mentioned

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,080
stratum is the one that supports all the

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,360
next generation interfaces p4p for

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,610
runtime and all of that and then now we

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,750
are also building the next generation on

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,220
us

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,800
and then on top of that a set of

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,140
services and now this particular next

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,630
generation is dn stack is going to

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,880
become the foundation for all the

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,640
solutions that we built so we are going

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,170
to transition from open flow base as the

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,380
end to p4 OPA config GMI and all of that

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:27,020
as we go forward so to just give you a

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:30,380
little more context about this so as you

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,930
know we started with open fluid Sdn

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,940
thing separation of control and

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,460
forwarding open flow was the protocol

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,190
that defined that but that protocol was

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,550
the standard it was kind of define and

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:46,490
relatively static and as a result it was

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,200
really not allowing you to specify the

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,279
forwarding

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,080
behavior dynamically in software and

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,940
making it easy also we didn't have much

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,399
of configuration we didn't have much

00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,750
operation that were part of the FDA and

00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:03,039
architecture okay now what we have done

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,510
with all the advancements that have

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,330
happened that you can have a

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,950
programmable forwarding plane a

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,250
forwarding thing or you can have fixed

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:15,490
function but what we can do is to allow

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:18,010
a network operator to be able to specify

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,919
the forwarding behavior they want in

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,779
people in a higher level brain specific

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,240
programming language and through a

00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:28,029
compiler you can compile that forwarding

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,039
behavior and then instantiate that in

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:32,529
the switching or in the forwarding plane

00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:35,620
as well as in the control plane using

00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:37,450
something called p4 runtime ok and then

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,970
we are also trying to support

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,950
configuration now and the operations for

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,250
configuration we are supporting open

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,590
config and G AMI and for operations we

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,870
are supporting the gni protocol and

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,240
these are the interfaces that Google has

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,610
successfully used in their network and

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,880
we are not trying to adopt them in this

00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:00,370
next generation is the N ok and then and

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,260
so that is what makes the stratum and as

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,870
I mentioned now we have build some work

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,000
on next generation or NAS where on one

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,090
hand we want to support the next

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,250
generation Sdn interfaces but also we

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:15,250
are we are collecting on us so we can

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,940
bring micro services base ideas and try

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,980
to make that honest or very very what

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,409
should as a tighter footprint for a

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,320
given use case so that for a given use

00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:29,500
case you can definitely customize it for

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,830
that particular use case and so together

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,230
our goal is to bring two big benefits to

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,850
the network operators so the first big

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,330
benefit we want to bring to the network

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,220
operators with this is enable operators

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,700
to completely control of the network

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,880
they can specify their behavior in the

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,370
p4 and compile it and then be able to

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,340
achieve this zero touch networking for

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,200
verification for network debugging

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,010
change management in lifecycle

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,380
management

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,820
ok ok so brief

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,830
I'm going to talk about another

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,810
particular thing that's a convert multi

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,940
access and core in some sense this is

00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,130
the most important thing so here what

00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,310
we're trying to do is to bring all these

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:17,300
pieces together into a converge access

00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:19,910
and edge okay and this is there are many

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,710
operators that are supporting us but let

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,560
me give you the problem statement and

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,970
you know what we are trying to enable so

00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,360
the first thing is that the network

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:31,550
operators operate many networks you may

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,800
know this right for every access

00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,170
technology wireline for Wireless

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,260
different kinds of wireless network they

00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,090
end up operating many infrastructures ok

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,000
and they end up deploying lots of

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,650
physical devices in order to operate

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,640
this infrastructure as you can imagine

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:52,070
this is very capex and OPEX intensive

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,640
and it makes their life much harder and

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:58,550
this is only going to get worse with 5g

00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,150
and IOT so the holy grail in the

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:04,040
operator world is can you build a single

00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,770
infrastructure where only the access

00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,510
link is unique depending on the extras

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,210
technology but rest of the

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:13,100
infrastructure can be the same ok and

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,190
that is what we are trying to enable

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,620
we're not only the infrastructure is the

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,530
same you can also have seamless services

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:24,200
that is a service can migrate from one

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,300
network to another and a user can

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,070
migrate in a seamless fashion without

00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:32,270
having to worry about which access

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,830
network you are on so I'm just so the

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,540
interesting thing here is that because

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,240
of all these innovations I'm talking

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,670
about what is considered the holy holy

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,740
grail of convergence becomes possible

00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,700
because if you have all the

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,520
disaggregation

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,620
you have this virtualization then you

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,080
can combine these functionalities for

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,870
multiple access technologies and you

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,610
don't have to have multiple network so

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,560
all these innovations I was talking

00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,010
about we are able to bring them together

00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,930
and be able to build a single platform

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:05,480
that brings all of these together for

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,520
wireless as well as wireline networks

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,020
I'm sorry I'm running out of time so I

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,620
will not go into but give me one minute

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,730
to wrap it up so but the idea is we are

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,130
able to now

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,190
that everything that we did for wireline

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:21,320
as well as the wireless because we did

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,139
that with disaggregation and because we

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,059
did this is virtual software function we

00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:28,659
are able to bring them together and in

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:31,940
fact if you are familiar with our

00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:33,799
architecture called code it actually

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,559
brings all of these pieces together and

00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:40,460
now we are leveraging all of this to

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:46,000
create this converge multi axis with

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:46,000
number of operators okay my last slide

00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:52,940
jump to this ok so thanks for sitting

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,240
through all these PowerPoint slides and

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,970
very high-level overview but interesting

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,669
thing is that everything I said is here

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,070
on the floor you can go and check out

00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:06,080
all these develop I mean the platform

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:09,409
solutions integrated things I talked

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,870
about all of them here lot of developers

00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:14,720
are there from the community go and ask

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,880
hard questions about implementations and

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,240
what we have done and the last comment

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,639
if you like what do you see don't be shy

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,559
come and join us and together we can

00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:25,470
make this transformation happen thank

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,849
you

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,849
