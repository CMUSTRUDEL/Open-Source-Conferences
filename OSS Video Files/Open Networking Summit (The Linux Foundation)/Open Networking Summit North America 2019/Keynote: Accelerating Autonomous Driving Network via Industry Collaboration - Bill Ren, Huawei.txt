[Music]

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,860
so morning everyone and billion from

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:36,260
Huawei I'm glad to be here to share with

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,290
you may thought about the future network

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,960
evolution so the short video just not

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,790
gave the title of my speech accelerating

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,530
the autonomous driving network where

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,850
industry collaboration so talk about

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,280
autonomous driving

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,739
so first let's have a look of the

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,640
history of material industry so you 1885

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,330
oh prince

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,460
Motorwagen the first car is a framework

00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:13,460
in 1958 the Saab G's 750 the first car

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:16,220
with seat belt and in 1978 the Cadillac

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,970
Seville the first car is the electronic

00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:25,729
control unit and in 1999 mercedes benz

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:28,700
the s-class w222 first car used adaptive

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,280
cruise so the first 100 years the car

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,040
industry improved you're confused curve

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,890
and the folk songs or traditional

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,520
challenges like the performance of the

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:44,570
engine the the driver safety and the

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,400
fuel efficiency and etc but for past 20

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,830
years some new players started to pay

00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,140
attention for some new challenges like

00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,540
global navigation had their definition

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,840
Maps and identified the environment

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,760
dynamically so by last year December so

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,400
we more wine commercial usage stand

00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:05,540
further autonomous driving has arrived

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,130
so by dealing with his new challenges we

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,300
clearly see a paradigm shift in

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:16,849
architecture and the ecosystem so look

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:21,230
at look at the history of a telco

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:23,360
with the even longer history so we also

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,319
have tradition challenge' tool to do is

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,300
like a capacity power consumption so we

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,000
have butter for what's the next 10 years

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,579
we have reason to ask ourselves why not

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,489
autonomous driving networks do we have a

00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:40,760
new challenge to do is to waste the auto

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:43,409
can use Co improvement or paradigm shift

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,260
so maybe we should ask her first why

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:49,319
autonomous driving Network so on one

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:53,579
hand the network complexity we can use

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:57,930
increase by the network scale web reach

00:02:53,579 --> 00:03:01,409
to 75 billion devices by 2025 and the

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,109
STF a technology will be deployed in

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:07,319
large scale and the magnet space will be

00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:09,810
expected a 100 opinion and and as a hand

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,019
the cost of the network operating and

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,090
the maintenance is huge the efficiency

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,099
of the carrier is 100 attempts lowers

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,840
the OTT players in some extent and the

00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:24,480
growth of the objects is much faster

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,269
than the revenue in the past 10 years

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,310
and at the same time the global

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:34,739
digitalization of the transformation has

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,879
huge opportunities to the network the

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:42,180
Magnus base of ICT digitalization is

00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:45,569
expected for Ginni and Magnus base for

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:49,290
the manufacturer digitalization is 6.4

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:52,040
training by 2019 and the ratio of IP and

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,099
the application mode to cloud will be

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,889
increased from 25 percentage to 95

00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,260
percentage to all these means we have

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,040
new challenges to take care so like

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,979
opening is intended driven and the self

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,859
Haney big data automation all those

00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:14,699
requires paradigm shift in architecture

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:17,940
and ecosystem so first let's look at the

00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:21,870
paradigm shift of architecture typical

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,300
autonomous Jerry our schema will be

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,940
abstracted as a three layered or

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,479
closed-loop architecture so enter the

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,909
bottom is a car which needed a large

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,729
number of sensors in the middle is

00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:37,110
automation layer which contains

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:39,449
automation control platform and big data

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,690
analysis platform the result of the

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,729
analysis we are directly driver control

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,150
platform to control to achieve this

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:51,610
automation and the table is a cloud AI

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:55,600
platform which contains the global

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:58,390
date and have a I'm odo trainee and the

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,880
inference capabilities we can see the

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,730
architecture shift from product-centric

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,910
to play the firm centric so similarly

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,970
for autumn autumn streaming network

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,620
architecture references related

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:15,520
closed-loop architecture we should also

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,510
add automation platform and AI platform

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,550
above these network elements so all

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:27,360
those platforms supposed to be public

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:30,640
and open so how to build this obviously

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,920
open source is a best way or effectively

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,570
to build it so refer to this

00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,500
architecture for autonomous driving

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:40,840
network the open source community should

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,510
build a common vision and framework to

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,630
draw the industry to work together so

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:51,190
legacies acumen for this cloud AI

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:55,210
platform own a preferred automation

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:58,510
platform own app and panda for this

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:02,190
analysis platform and a criminal

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:06,640
fado openmp to build and operate in this

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,980
optimized infrastructure so we can say

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,880
we have a full stack community to be

00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:15,820
leveraged so refer to the maturity level

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,290
of autonomous driving hey a week we'd

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,920
like to give some definition and the

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:24,490
details of an autonomous driving network

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:28,600
so from top bottom app we can see the

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:31,320
scenarios from deployment and service

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,090
provisioning to network optimization

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,720
planning and the design from left to

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,630
right

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,830
step-by-step other menu work will be

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:44,050
replaced by Zod AI robots to achieve

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,310
from level two partially autonomous

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:50,440
traveling all the way to the level four

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,260
level five highly and the fully

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:57,010
autonomous driving experience so

00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:00,240
compared to the car most about level 4

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:03,130
already so the network steering lever to

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,700
today so where the network is lagging

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,810
behind so we

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,040
how to talk about another paradigm shift

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:14,540
so this is a paradigm shift of ecosystem

00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,200
where autonomous driving developed so

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,380
fast the rich ecosystem on the Left gave

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,270
us a reason so there are not only

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,810
traditional car manufacturers transport

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,390
operators but also technology providers

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,900
to autonomous driving platform is a bit

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:35,680
in the middle in the B turn so many

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,900
internet companies has practiced those

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,970
technologies needed for those automation

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,450
platform so therefore for the car

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,980
industry has entered a cross industry

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:49,640
open innovation and the collaboration

00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,890
mode from a single industry so locators

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:56,150
the ecosystem for the telco industry

00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:59,170
apart from operator and the windows

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:02,390
there its lack of technology providers

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:04,490
for the automation platform in the

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:07,460
middle so there's no single company

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:11,570
could offer all those technologies of

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,400
the automation so how to embrace the new

00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,850
technology and how to build this rich

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,550
ecosystem again the community of the

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:22,490
open source may be the effective way but

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,430
as the community and its patent also

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,080
need a paradigm shift so firstly is open

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,150
source community needed to more than

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,840
come share the code and the Builder

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:37,280
common we have marked the place and also

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,380
to the certification program secondly in

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,680
addition to the traditional operator and

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:47,480
the windows it's necessary to introduce

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,940
some OTG players and watch Co industries

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,160
to share the air technologies of their

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,520
capabilities and the industry knowledge

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,660
--is and to achieve a better cloud and a

00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,260
network experience so to accelerate the

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,180
autonomous driving network occur for

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,390
windows operators and the community to

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,210
act so for windows of course it's better

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,730
to add more scenarios and the use case

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,620
to the community to define the new

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,830
challenge and the architecture together

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,560
so Swisscom why we are now here

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,990
bill disease broadband service extrusion

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,420
with own app so it's a good example

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,839
it's I encourage you to visit have APIs

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,110
for more detail for operators to submit

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,079
Apple on the app deployment to issue own

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:39,290
app related RFP so orange and of our way

00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:43,339
has joined honey verify disease only

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,980
paste extrusion service with SD ones I

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,260
Steven your commercial environment so

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,920
welcome to you attend disease track

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,019
session tomorrow and for communities we

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,670
should join therapy or disease we have

00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,790
only a base that we have from Mac the

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:02,180
place so far we had in western you know

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:05,089
testing frameworks or we pre program so

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:10,040
I encourage you to visit our boss format

00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:13,459
for more detail so finally as a summary

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,890
so we have new challenges to deal with

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:18,040
we we should a deal with opening these

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:21,410
and the intelligence beyond the

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:25,010
efficiency so a new paradigm shift to

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,529
build this platform and ecosystem beyond

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,829
the products so new collaboration is

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:33,890
needed joined her vision and the cross

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:37,790
industry collaboration beyond a single

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:41,149
community so well final thought about

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:44,510
what matters in the journey of open

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:48,829
source and in the past years what we

00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:52,520
learned so what first the open or closed

00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:55,220
is just a means it's doesn't matter and

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,380
to the end it matters is extreme

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:03,079
experience you could bring to your end

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,160
the user second the open is not a

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,970
attitude
