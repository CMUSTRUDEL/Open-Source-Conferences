Description: 
	Keynote: Suppliers Innovation Meets Open Source - Marisa Viveros, Vice President of Strategy and Offerings, Telecommunications, Media & Entertainment, IBM

The Cathedral and the Bazaar development styles born over 20 years ago is now impacting the Telecommunications industry, as networks evolve from primarily proprietary bundled hardware and software to cloud native software, open standards platforms - arguable, all in support of 5G and Edge Computing. In this section we will discuss the value created with open source by traditional network and IT suppliers. Key questions are: is there room for suppliers to innovate in this new world order?  are end users going to take charge?  is a collaborative strategy across Operators and Suppliers a best practice?

About Marisa Viveros
I am responsible for IBM strategy for Telecommunications and Media companies, with focus on solutions to accelerate adoption of 5G, Edge Computing, NFV, AI, Automation, Digital. A member of LFN Governance Board.

good morning everyone so good so we will

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,230
talk a few minutes about open source

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,650
software in how a company like IBM is

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,450
approaching open source in how we have

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,390
actually done it for many years so

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,090
really my message to you another on my

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,970
talk is going to be you know all

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,119
companies can take great advantage of

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,240
open source software and we have a

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,210
methodology of course and how we had

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,940
actually adopt that into the open

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,149
networking space so let me take you

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,360
through my history in a way of what IBM

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:46,050
is doing so until the law a few years

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,239
ago it was said that not open source was

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,340
gonna eat software with increase in

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,629
number of participants increased in

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,710
number of a contribution encouragement

00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:57,690
everyone know some people are gaining

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,260
comparative advantage and new companies

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,600
being born by that in that area right

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,420
within IBM we have a long history of

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,400
working with open source software in

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,810
fact know one of the promoters of Linux

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,900
working with leanest foundation later on

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,630
working with Apache spark not you name

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,360
it across these 20 years key

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,979
technologies have been influenced but

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,960
what we have been doing in this area

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:31,020
ladies you know announcements has been

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,500
on hyper laser we work within our IBM

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,990
research development technology we knew

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,650
that in order to work he needed to be

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,810
much broader than just IBM therefore we

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,320
work within this foundation in a number

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,500
of other companies to put hyper laser I

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,540
in turn into open source in today we are

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,320
covering a new whole new business models

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,369
around our blockchain and of course you

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,110
know my role is bringing open networking

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:04,170
into the company in working that as part

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,409
of our strategy so how do we approach

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,140
that and you may want to go to our

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,110
website developers works we have a white

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,840
paper on how we approach open source

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,420
software on

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,910
development so it's not just something

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,459
that if you the technical teams are

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,010
doing is really coming from an astrology

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,540
standpoint we have a discipline of doing

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,140
that and that's what I will take you

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:33,160
through it so first of all we earn our

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:36,340
stripes you know we do contribute we fix

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:41,319
bugs enemy might our technical teams of

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,330
course we build expertise as one of my

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,959
colleagues said we do some of the dirty

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,569
work

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,000
before we get known into each one of

00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,370
these areas but we also we foster

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,530
communities we open your communities and

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,870
we continue to evolve you know the

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,470
industry in these 20 years in this

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:03,459
different key software strategies in the

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,310
benefit of our clients now this is for

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,760
you know we represent many different

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:13,000
industries whether it is government

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,700
banking insurance now telecom are the

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,450
most recent they all want to take

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,790
benefit or that open source software

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,359
you know dynamic that is going on in the

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:29,260
market so we have actually trademark

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:31,560
something that we call IBM is open by

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,599
design and really there are three

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,690
methodologies that we can go here one is

00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,090
open source only and that will require a

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,609
lot of assembly right a lot of system

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,130
integration a lot of the program is

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:48,630
trying to take this to open source of it

00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:51,940
and make it relevant and useful to your

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,819
organization's the second area will be

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,130
local or proprietary in some cases it

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,130
makes sense you know

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,780
we in fact we do use some of that

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,660
proprietary software within I would

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,359
enterprise in in some cases it makes

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,049
sense to do that but that obviously it

00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:13,900
brings the the vendor lock-in that that

00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:16,660
most of us want to avoid the same

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,180
approach which is approach that we are

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,220
promoting is partnering partnering with

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,200
the community partnering with our

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,810
clients pondering with other vendors

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,670
sometimes our competitors so in fact we

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,630
do have another partnership

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,960
Microsoft with Google in bringing really

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:39,430
that enterprise innovation by using open

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,440
source so that really engages know many

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,050
people in text the benefit of working

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,180
you know in the community like this one

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,890
so open source by design is something

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,470
that we created is something that it is

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:53,560
from from our top of the company is the

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,380
monitor in encourage as well as part of

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,340
and in fact I will see your has gone one

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,880
step further

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,220
sheekha said every pieces unit no matter

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,490
what business you are need to have an

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,820
open source of strategy so no longer the

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,310
Kraus proprietary is is good within our

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,640
own business now in order to achieve

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,580
this open governance must be paramount

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,880
in this areas and we like you know have

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,730
not in dark white paper that I mentioned

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,400
responsible licensing IP are you know

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,640
licensing agreements no accessible

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,190
commit processes open governance that we

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,720
believe that us no we have a series of

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,580
metal arising we have learned throughout

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,040
these 20 years on what are the key

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,650
issues that we should be addressing in

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,590
order to make that open source

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:48,790
successful obviously we also contribute

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:51,760
to github and as we are technical teams

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,910
put much of their technologies we have

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,770
an open technology team that makes sure

00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,250
that every one of those contributions

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:03,520
are in line toward a strategy aligned to

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,230
our IP and and we can bring that into

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,900
the markets through the to the

00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,460
communities so github very much we are

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,040
main contributors and putting our

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,890
software are there but let me take you

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,220
to what is relevant to this audience

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:21,400
applying that that open source software

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:26,830
strategy into open networking so we

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:30,370
began 2014 becoming founding sponsors of

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:33,160
OPN EFI we went further couple years

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,680
later and joined on up as again as a

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,890
founding member and now we are obviously

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,040
working with the Linux Foundation in LF

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,080
networking for which I am aboard

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,760
what we have done with the software now

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,090
which i think is more relevant to what

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:51,900
you are doing first of all on app deploy

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:54,090
on IBM cloud private now this is where

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,590
now we bring the business perspective in

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,690
green shoe or that open source software

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,390
is relevant to our business so every

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,880
time we sell Anana places we be carrying

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:05,550
you know an IBM cloud private which is

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,280
nothing more than an industrialized

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,610
version of kubernetes with more privacy

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,230
in more AI and and in machine learning

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,570
applications embedded within the

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,510
platform so bringing that benefit to our

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,740
clients along without signal security

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,660
that I mentioned before

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,910
so this agreein now we're talking to

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,700
make real that open source software

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,670
becoming a business for us the second

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:33,150
area is initially IP n services for

00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,490
honorable we provide programming

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,280
services that means dev of capabilities

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,940
that can take that open source software

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,270
and making much more stronger and

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,940
relevant to your initiation integration

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,090
services deployment testing all of that

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,580
goes into the particular services in

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,340
finally we rank fifth as you may have

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,890
seen in this slide yesterday ranked

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,230
fifth in contributions are into the

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,730
honors offers so probably something that

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,620
you did not that that was coming from

00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,930
IBM those are kind of very concrete

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,620
steps that we are taking along many

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:14,070
others that are there are nuts are here

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,980
but I think it key message is how we're

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:21,120
applying this how do we apply to our

00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:23,160
clients and really transforming them how

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,050
they do the digital customer engagement

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,540
how they transform the backing processes

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,440
in how they build new platforms and

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,860
services with this new clarifying

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,140
network that everyone is streaming about

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,390
right whether it is the core network or

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,090
the edge network that is all going to be

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,760
in the cloud and again IBM will have a

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,010
role to play in that area and building

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,680
those platforms that allows you know our

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,750
clients the operators to monetize their

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,480
investments as well as their ongoing

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,300
research finally I

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,100
like to finish with some of the key

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,430
points that again

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,550
perhaps as RP said before not known how

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,430
IBM is working in the industry working

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,220
with over 80 percent of the operators

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:15,899
across the world in many countries four

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,060
operators are our clients iBM is just

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,920
like myself within a strategy I be a

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,110
misleading technology product

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,199
development services you know more than

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,769
25,000 people are working with operators

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:32,820
in key media companies around the world

00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:37,529
I would have mentioned 25 25 years or

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,839
living IP in a pattern production so you

00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:43,139
can see now that bring it all together

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,910
no open source does not make any

00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:48,649
impediments for us to continue

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:52,199
contribute in that IP and patent

00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:55,920
production and obviously we are bringing

00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:58,440
into this environment or 60 clouds that

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,069
we have around the world taking

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,440
convention to privacy as well as

00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:07,230
compliance in regulations in order to

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,449
bring that edge of the cloud in in

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:13,500
capabilities in order to realize that

00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:16,500
that FISA Network so I hope you now can

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,500
change your perception and but it no key

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,959
message is open source software will not

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,329
destroy the IT industry on the contrary

00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,600
it's going to change the industry and

00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:30,329
make it you know in a much better way it

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,940
really is for a skier to collaborate in

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:36,300
making that reality so I invite you to

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,730
learn more about what iBM is doing in

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,110
terms of open source practices many

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,300
times we consult with our customers

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,000
about our practices and how we have been

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,329
able to leverage that in really build

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,040
businesses around it and I also know I

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:53,790
don't know encourage you to learn more

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,790
about what iBM is doing in terms of I

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:59,010
don't telecom in media and how we are

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,350
