	Keynote: Suppliers Innovation Meets Open Source - Marisa Viveros, Vice President of Strategy and Offerings, Telecommunications, Media & Entertainment, IBM

In this section we will discuss the value created with open source by traditional network and IT suppliers. Key questions are: is there room for suppliers to innovate in this new world order?  are end users going to take charge?  is a collaborative strategy across Operators and Suppliers a best practice?
