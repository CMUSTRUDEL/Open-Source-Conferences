Description: 
	Keynote: Accelerating the Pace of Innovation - Axel Clauberg, Vice President, Aggregation, Transport, IP (TI-ATI) & Infrastructure Cloud Architecture, Deutsche Telekom AG

The exponential Internet traffic growth is still one of the main challenges for the Telco industry. In the past, Moore’s Law has helped us to keep our production cost for the exponentially growing traffic under control. With Moore’s Law flattening out, we see a strong trend in the industry towards the disaggregation of hardware and software. From monolithic black-box solutions, we are moving towards a modular, best-in-class, flexible and open ecosystem, including an automated lifecycle management in true DevOps style. None of the Telcos can do this on their own – the success of this industry depends on collaboration. This presentation covers Deutsche Telekom’s strategy in Linux Foundation/Linux Foundation Networking Fund, ONF, TIP and other organizations to accelerate the pace of innovation for the telco industry.

good morning kouha marker which is

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,529
actually from the Netherlands I at least

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,150
some so my Dutch is a little bit limited

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,219
but at least I can speak some words and

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,309
I can understand now talking about

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,500
acceleration in the Netherlands actually

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,140
sounds like an oxymoron to me because

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,010
when I come from Germany driving here by

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,460
car and cross across the border I have

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,550
to slow down drastically actually and

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,830
also the Netherlands for me is a country

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,300
where I decelerate where I go sailing

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:39,329
where I go for bicycle ride or just the

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,550
beach so accelerating the pace of the

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,350
industry originally I was looking for a

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,930
picture showing the acceleration the

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,180
need for acceleration actually from the

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,879
Dutch Grand Prix the last Dutch Grand

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,570
Prix and son for it happened back in

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:56,129
1985 so quite some time ago and I didn't

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,070
find a picture but I found a picture

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,760
from another Grand Prix also happening

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,470
in the dunes in behind showing the need

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,090
for acceleration because here you saw

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,770
right after the start of the race and

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,750
the one who won the race that was

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,420
Rosberg he was actually ahead of the

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,790
crowd and you see bought us in that

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,409
Williams car crashing into Hamilton here

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,390
and as a result Hamilton only finished

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,009
the race three at third position and

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,119
respect became the world champion in

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,640
that year so now what does that mean for

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,049
our industry what does that mean for the

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,790
telco industry why does oops it's so

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,909
simple and I managed to press the wrong

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,189
button so what does it actually mean for

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,020
the tech or industry why do we need to

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,070
accelerate and we have that well-known

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,350
picture out of the Cisco vni expectation

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,149
on the traffic traffic is growing

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,000
exponentially and we actually don't see

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,890
an end to the exponential growth in some

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,290
areas I believe that the Cisco number is

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,869
actually very conservative we're

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,479
actually seeing compound annual growth

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,700
rates which are slightly higher in some

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,110
of our regions especially on the mobile

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:16,650
network but also touching us in fixed

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,650
so it's a safe assumption traffic will

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,260
continue to grow over the next year's

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,210
now in the past Mo's law had actually

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,010
helped us to keep our production cost

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,920
under control because with the

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,980
densification of Hardware smaller

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,980
structures on silicon and higher

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,230
performance at the same time slightly

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,880
lowering the price we were actually able

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,850
to keep our production cost under

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,540
control now most law is flattening out

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,790
and that is definitely not helpful in

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,590
that situation here because I can't

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,800
expect that I get high-performing

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,340
equipment for maybe slightly lower price

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,480
over the years at the same time

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,470
obviously the Apple for traditional

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,270
services it's not expected to grow

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,350
unfortunately it's more expected to be

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,350
flat if we're lucky

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:11,790
or in reality it might even shrink in a

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:14,840
couple of our markets now at that time

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,600
we're actually introducing a new

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,080
technology generation we are introducing

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,410
5g we're rolling out 5g and this is a

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,010
paradigm shift which is touching us in

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,840
many many areas we're seeing obviously a

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,019
trend to move the service production

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,959
into the cloud some complete network

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,970
production into the cloud we will see

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,709
Network slicing the full beauty of 5g

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,220
coming slowly to the market we're going

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,890
to see initial steps towards roll out in

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,239
the 2019 2020 timeframe initially

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,700
bringing out 5g new radio and then over

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,920
the course of the 2020s you're going to

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,130
see the introduction of the advanced

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:04,769
concepts kind of bringing 5g to its full

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:07,650
beauty so all of that if we cannot

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,410
change the model we're using to build

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,090
networks will drive up our cost now

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,730
that's the situation we don't like to

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,260
have so we have to do something against

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,850
it we have to keep our cost under

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,650
control and I don't say here that the

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,020
innovation we are receiving through our

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,860
vendors is not good anymore

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:33,789
I worked on the vendor side for many

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,979
years in my personal career and the

00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:39,849
innovation driven by the vendors is one

00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:41,349
important element for this industry but

00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,259
the vendors are facing the same

00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:46,750
challenges and we're also facing

00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,699
challenges on the talent side for

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,680
example operators are facing the

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,199
challenge to attract top talent and the

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:58,659
established vendors are facing the same

00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:01,630
issue now in general we see that there's

00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:05,949
a strong trend towards this aggregation

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,599
and kind of taking away the concept of a

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:10,319
black box which is delivered as a

00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:12,370
combination of hardware and software and

00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,800
replacing that by a Best of Breed

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:19,750
approach breaking up the system and

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,300
white box which is our one example where

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,250
this is actually done separating

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,430
hardware and software and having open

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,520
interfaces in between now that's all

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,919
easy said but I mentioned this small

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,130
challenge on the talent side we are

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,719
changing the model here completely the

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,060
way we are working is changing

00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:41,800
completely and it's a huge skill set

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,400
transformation which is required to

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:49,719
actually master the challenge as well so

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,360
the move to DevOps that is actually

00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,520
quite tough so together with an open

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,240
ecosystem we see a development towards

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:02,440
an open tackle and that cultural shift

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,099
that won't happen overnight so when we

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,210
started that journey to its

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,849
clarification of our network functions

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:13,300
that was back in 2012 I was presenting

00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:16,630
at ons in Santa Clara back in 2012 our

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,699
vision on how services would be produced

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:22,389
in the future and that was the starting

00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:25,060
point later that year at Siena V was

00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:28,419
announced sending a first signal to the

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,520
industry but what happened then was

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:35,610
actually people fell back into their old

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,500
behavior into their old way of working

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,000
because you saw a lot of standardization

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,560
people joining in there you

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,160
didn't really see the people with cloud

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,540
experience joining so as a result I

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,390
think it took a little bit longer than

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,920
expected also for our vendors it took a

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,510
little bit longer than expected to

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:58,060
actually make that move and also re

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:01,320
architect and rewrite the applications

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:08,200
they are selling to us in such a

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:10,510
disaggregated production world now we're

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,630
seeing a lot of organizations actually I

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:16,750
started here back in 2000 when the Linux

00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,310
Foundation was actually founded I put

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,440
some organizations up here just to

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,790
explain the selection of organizations

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:27,730
where myself or my team or the teams of

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,740
my peers have been engaged in so if your

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,290
favorite organization doesn't show up on

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,800
that slide I apologize but it's not

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:38,110
intentional just I started them on the

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,130
timeline so on the left you see 2000

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,600
metha was created in 2001 and I put MEF

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,390
up here not as it's an open-source

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,220
organization but the example was brought

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,860
up a couple of times that there is a

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,740
great collaboration established between

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:57,280
what we're doing here in LS n what we're

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,790
doing in own app and what's done in meth

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,690
so for me that's a great example for

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,380
collaboration in this industry for

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:07,390
collaboration between organizations and

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,360
likewise you can put onf up here with

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:13,390
the work they are driving how it relates

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,630
to what we're driving in L FN and also

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:20,050
in other organizations the Open Compute

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,550
project was created back in 2011 and

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,280
that was actually bringing in a new

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,160
dimension opening up the hardware layer

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,840
as well moving or extending the

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,120
open-source concept to the hardware

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,210
layer as well taking responsibility and

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,640
taking a community R&D effort also on

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:42,580
the hardware layer back in 2011 it was

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,100
mostly a Facebook driven activity with

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,560
few others sure adjoining but this

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,150
really took off when we look at it in

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,410
2015 2016 when also lots of teracles had

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,029
joined

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,519
the Open Compute Project the Technical

00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:01,029
Working Group in LCP was formed back in

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,310
early 2016 and for me that's a great

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,970
success as well the work which is driven

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:09,279
there in LCP well I cannot have a

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,220
presentation without talking about the

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,160
organization I'm sharing so back at

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,160
Mobile World Congress 2016 we had

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,100
announced together with Facebook intern

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:30,519
okiya and SK Telecom the creation of the

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:32,860
telecom infrared website which was

00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:36,459
developed in OCP and extending it to the

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,810
overall telco infrastructure and that's

00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,399
actually a real challenge because the

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,660
overall telco infrastructure as soon as

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,759
you're touching Hardware as soon as

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,139
you're touching mobile that's the world

00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:48,339
where you really have to watch out for

00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:50,589
existing IPR and you have to adjust you

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,750
cannot just go with a traditional open

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:56,170
source approach in this world you have

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,420
to offer different IPR control

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,389
mechanisms to the project groups driving

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,569
work in tip now at the same time the

00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:06,910
extra a group was announced opening up

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:10,720
the radio access network and just

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:15,880
recently in this year Exxon and C Ron

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:20,230
have merged to show up as Iran also in

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,329
this year lfn started operation with the

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:26,880
work on own app before now all of these

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:29,949
organizations are extremely important

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,130
for the acceleration of the innovation

00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:37,449
pace in this industry the challenge I

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:40,029
have in my day role at DT is how can we

00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:42,730
staff all of that how can we make sure

00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,949
that things are going in the right

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,699
direction how can we avoid overlap

00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:51,069
between the organization's it's kind of

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,019
in my night job chairman of tip there is

00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:54,790
a certain tendency if you bring up a new

00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:57,430
organization that you want to grab some

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:01,029
land and that you want to show hey it's

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:04,839
my organization doing this great thing

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:07,400
for the industry but taking the other

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,860
head-on again looking from the indus

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,220
perspective looking at the scarce

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,980
resource situation we have we have to

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,200
watch out and we have to reduce the

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,060
overlap and we have to avoid the

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,300
duplication of efforts under all

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:26,120
circumstances and that's what I'm

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,830
pushing for in my role within tip and

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,470
likewise in the governance board within

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,600
lfn and I think especially here we're on

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,120
a good track and hopefully you're going

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,770
to see some announcements between some

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,240
of the organizations listed on that

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,980
chart actually moving forward

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,540
unfortunately I wanted to make some

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,790
announcement today but I can't because

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:48,170
there was no agreement to go out with an

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:51,320
announcement now let's look a little bit

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,930
at real life let's look a little bit at

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,900
the technology we are deploying the

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,940
clarification of network functions let's

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:03,470
look at the way teracles are actually

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:10,190
deploying this when we started the whole

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:12,260
discussion on NFV we actually envisioned

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,529
the picture on the far right of the

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:18,470
chart the picture on the far right says

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:21,950
basically the operators are taking full

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,690
system integration responsibility you're

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,209
building this either on the open source

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,760
hardware so OCP hardware or maybe also

00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:30,860
on commodity hardware then you're

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,910
putting an open source management layer

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:38,360
like OpenStack on top own app on top and

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:41,779
then you put in the applications which

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,970
still come from a vendor but the service

00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:45,980
provider in this picture would take the

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,560
full system integration responsibility

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:53,029
both horizontally as well as vertically

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,680
vertically when you look around in the

00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:57,140
operator world they're actually only

00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,040
very few takers who have implemented in

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:03,500
this in this way AT&T is probably the

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,770
front-runner in this space and so are a

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,940
couple of others China Mobile and a few

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,580
others as well in this space but we are

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,339
struggling as an industry actually to

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,250
attract open source developers because

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:21,260
if you follow that model you better have

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,630
a team of open source developers who are

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,200
providing the traditional level 2 and

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:29,560
level 3 support and well if you don't

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,510
have the open-source developers yourself

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,940
you better go with the support model and

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,590
we saw that in OpenStack we saw that

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,290
with red hat with canonical warranties

00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:44,780
delivering OpenStack distributions and

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:47,750
selling support on these distributions

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,470
so that's how OpenStack as open-source

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:54,440
made it into a lot of the operators and

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:58,210
we received support just like from a reg

00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,550
regular vendor on the regular product

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:03,740
now especially the smaller operators the

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:07,040
tier 2's the tier threes they are more

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,930
on the far left end of that spectrum so

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,700
they are approaching one vendor and the

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:14,470
vendor delivers a full solution that's

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,550
what I would call a virtualized silo now

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,110
looking at that picture is actually very

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,920
interesting if we're looking at the work

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:24,230
of lfn if we're looking at own app that

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,200
picture tells a lot what needs to be

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:31,160
done in this industry to actually

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:33,980
deliver own app in production to the

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,260
operators because most of the

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,310
deployments you see more than 80% of the

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,320
deployments you see will require some

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,320
commercial support for own app now own

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,970
app I think it's a great initiative for

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,010
the for the industry it's great to have

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,550
so many operators behind it's great to

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:57,560
have so many vendors behind as well but

00:14:52,550 --> 00:15:00,200
it's also fairly big so we don't see any

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,940
vendor supporting the full beauty of own

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,150
app at this point in time I think the

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,970
way forward is really go for a classical

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,810
agile approach identify a minimal Viable

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:15,560
Product which makes sense for a lot of

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,240
the operators and position this as a

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,610
commercial product in the market I think

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:24,620
that's a way forward for vendors in this

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:28,610
space here to support the deployment

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,020
models were actually seeing by the way I

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,390
didn't say that any of the deployment

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,420
models are good or bad yeah I still love

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,339
the one on the right but

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,820
all of them are valid deployment models

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:43,389
now it's actually interesting talking to

00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:45,730
a lot of people recently about the

00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:48,850
future of all of this you saw some

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,870
alarming articles some time ago I

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:55,029
believe that started back in 2016 2017

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,480
the industry is behind compared to the

00:15:55,029 --> 00:16:01,060
original plans and some were doubting

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,019
that the way to use open source is to

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:07,990
write one anyhow well I think that would

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:12,010
be the wrong approach to just fall back

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,930
onto the black box approach but still we

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,130
need to do something so talking to

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,930
people there's one big trend coming up

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:23,920
and let the trend to talk about cloud

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:26,949
native and just before I show the next

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,779
slide I know it's sometimes a problem to

00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:32,649
show a religious picture in a

00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:34,420
multicultural event the fact that we are

00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,880
running in Europe and that there are so

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,600
beautiful museums here in Amsterdam and

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,490
other European cities might give me an

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,660
apology I probably would not use that

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:49,029
picture of paradise in a event we would

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,390
run in the u.s. anyhow here's a picture

00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:56,110
from Lucas Cranach which is actually in

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:59,350
the Vienna Museum of Art showing a

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,720
picture of paradise and many people are

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:06,339
positioning cloud native as paradise

00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,980
today now when you look at that picture

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,280
in detail so in front that's where God

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,640
gives kind of the ownership of paradise

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,530
to Adam and Eve when you look at the the

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,890
second layer in the picture it actually

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,959
shows what can happen paradise can kind

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:26,260
of develop into hell and you might get

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,240
thrown out of paradise now is that

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:38,169
what's happening in cloud native not

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:40,630
sure is when we started that vision back

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:43,990
in 2012 we actually had that vision of

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,730
cloud native there was actually a debate

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,890
behind the scenes at least within

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,250
Deutsche Telekom at that time

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:53,440
should we really call it NFV because I

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,470
wanted to have a/c in there for clouds

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,940
so I was really happy to see when the

00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:02,050
cloud native foundation created that

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:04,750
term on the cloud native function CNF

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,460
instead of vnf I think that's absolutely

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,570
right description I wanted to have it

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,790
back in 2012

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,350
unfortunately the term NFC was already

00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,700
used at that time so we couldn't use

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:17,290
network function clarification now I

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,720
really learned that the industry

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,810
transformation takes time

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:27,100
I started at DT almost exactly seven

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:29,680
years ago and I learned why it's taking

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,540
so much time it's not just within DT

00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,170
it's the same across the industry and I

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,570
mentioned it already the talent topic is

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,370
one the skillset transformation indeed

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,340
takes time the process transformation

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,230
takes time and I fully understand our

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,080
vendors as well that they didn't really

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:51,450
jump on that initiative right away and

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:56,200
started reacting their core services

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:57,460
because obviously when when the service

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,190
providers put more pressure on the

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,590
margin side it takes some time until you

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,390
start to kind of enter end-of-life or

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,920
existing product and then you indeed

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,810
start with redevelopment and

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,420
re-architecting it to be truly cloud

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,280
native but the cloud native world is not

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,050
that easy and I would say anyone who

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,570
doesn't gain the experience in today's

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,780
kind of heavy virtualization virtual

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:22,030
machine-based world will fail in the

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,460
cloud native world the lifecycle

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,170
management the network io optimization

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,510
these are topics you have to master in

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,220
today's world as well the orchestration

00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,200
is something you have to master in

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,540
today's world as well you cannot just

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,730
say we're waiting for cloud native to

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,350
solve all our problems then exactly what

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,220
cannot described in that picture

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:44,800
he painted sometime in the 15th century

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,180
will take place so we do have the

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,780
challenges on orchestration and

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,880
automation we do have a great initiative

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,700
with onap taking the right steps also

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,320
towards the micro service world and the

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,780
containerization and that definitely

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,610
will require some focus also the

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,779
question how we bring in in AI to

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,549
actually Orchestra

00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:08,710
in a microservice world with

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:10,330
distribution up to the edge so that will

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,549
be a very interesting question also

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,200
moving forward here also the other Linux

00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:19,649
Foundation initiatives whether it's

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,649
acumen saw will play an important role

00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:24,190
one of the initiatives as part of

00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:27,759
elephant feeder

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:31,389
I think is extremely important also for

00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,429
the future for networking in containers

00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:35,769
because most people who are talking

00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:37,719
about containers are actually not aware

00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:40,210
about the challenges this brings on the

00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:43,509
networking side so that definitely

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:46,149
requires focus and looking at my friends

00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:48,369
here in the first row much like as a

00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:54,339
session I believe this this afternoon on

00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:56,320
this topic now one important topic we

00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:58,059
have to cover as well and that security

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,820
I was a little bit surprised Michael

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:05,019
that in your survey security popped up

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,089
on the on the low end I think looking at

00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:10,299
a micro service based world looking at a

00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:12,399
containerized production we have to be

00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:15,669
aware that this that the security

00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:17,649
paradigm is actually changing because

00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,989
today's security paradigm is still based

00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:23,080
on good old access control lists you

00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:24,700
know the layer 3 and layer 4 addresses

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,159
and that's basically what you're using

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,499
to set up your security now that doesn't

00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,049
apply anymore if you're spinning up and

00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:34,629
spinning down micro services on the fly

00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:37,809
so you have to change the paradigm here

00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:40,259
and that definitely requires a lot of

00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:42,489
focus and likewise the operator

00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:45,309
operationalization of the whole thing

00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:48,429
will require real focus from us to

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:50,460
actually be successful with a micro

00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:53,710
service based production in the future

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,899
with that I'd like to close and thank

00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,270
you and hope you have a great rest of

00:21:55,899 --> 00:22:02,059
the day

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:02,059
