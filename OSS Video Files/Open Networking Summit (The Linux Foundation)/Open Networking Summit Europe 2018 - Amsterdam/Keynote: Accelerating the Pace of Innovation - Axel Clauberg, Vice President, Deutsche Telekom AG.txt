	Keynote: Accelerating the Pace of Innovation - Axel Clauberg, Vice President, Aggregation, Transport, IP (TI-ATI) & Infrastructure Cloud Architecture, Deutsche Telekom AG

The exponential Internet traffic growth is still one of the main challenges for the Telco industry. In the past, Moore’s Law has helped us to keep our production cost for the exponentially growing traffic under control. With Moore’s Law flattening out, we see a strong trend in the industry towards the disaggregation of hardware and software. From monolithic black-box solutions, we are moving towards a modular, best-in-class, flexible and open ecosystem, including an automated lifecycle management in true DevOps style. None of the Telcos can do this on their own – the success of this industry depends on collaboration. This presentation covers Deutsche Telekom’s strategy in Linux Foundation/Linux Foundation Networking Fund, ONF, TIP and other organizations to accelerate the pace of innovation for the telco industry.
