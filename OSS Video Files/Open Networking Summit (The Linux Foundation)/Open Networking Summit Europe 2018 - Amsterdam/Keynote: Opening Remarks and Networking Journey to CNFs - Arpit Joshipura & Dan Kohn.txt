your phone along with that you have a

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,399
couple of other things like the

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,799
networking app that connects each other

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,250
in the event in real time so download

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,710
this app and then finally you know make

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,330
sure you fill out a survey

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,120
this is extremely important an email

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,480
will come in this feedback is how we get

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,000
better at these events okay so that's

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,940
kind of the housekeeping and what I

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,010
would like to do now is kind of walk you

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:34,140
through a journey of of networking and

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,350
kind of walk you through you know where

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,430
we have come but before I do that it's

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:45,090
always great to see how far we have come

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,270
and you know effectively we have a lot

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,780
of you guys in the audience that have

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:55,260
been with us since day one but what I'd

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,260
like to do next is show you some of the

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,420
early open networking summits and where

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,550
it's all started in you know Stanford

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:18,930
and Silicon Valley so can we roll the

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:20,790
videos please we can bring new software

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,960
new capabilities new services to market

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,970
more quickly there are more than 600

00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,860
people interested in participating in

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,900
the summit there more than 200 people

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,270
wanting to attend the tutorials and

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,370
there were more than 25 companies an

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:40,110
organization that wanted to do the demos

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,610
so that's pretty exciting you can see

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,650
that the demand has been like

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,690
significantly high from day one and we

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,510
have been you know added for the last

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,740
eight plus years so today what I want to

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,510
do is you know walk you through this

00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:55,200
journey of what I call open source if

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,770
ocation and networking and how we are

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,320
enabling you know the next wave of what

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,320
we calling CNF soar cloud native network

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,250
functions so what I'll be covering is

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,080
you know the last 142 years of the

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,630
networking industry now I don't remember

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,230
all the things from the past but in just

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,580
the last five years what we have done is

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,120
extremely significant so the three

00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,070
takeaways for us as an industry is

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,570
number one the power of open and

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,610
harmonized communities drives innovation

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,310
creates value and we all know that and

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,020
it has been significant over the last

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,220
couple of years so we'll talk about that

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:41,100
today we'll talk about how networking

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,320
impacts adjacent areas adjacent markets

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,190
adjacent communities and and it's

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:50,640
shaping the cloud the edge the IOT deep

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,310
learning ai access you know complete

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,710
areas adjacent to networking and how we

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,720
are shaping it and finally you know

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,480
we'll talk about the journey to cloud

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,280
native and how one of the industries you

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,850
know telecommunications is embarking on

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,650
that so let's begin with the fact that

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,860
the power of collaboration and

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,240
harmonization is what drives us and what

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,060
motivates here at the Linux Foundation

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,280
we started this a year and a half ago by

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,800
calling it harmonization one dot oh you

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,450
know it's open collaboration OMA open

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,820
communities open standards and open

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,550
source right so we're not talking about

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,490
you know or we're talking about the

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,020
power of and open source and open

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,630
standards you know we announced

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,630
partnerships with math TM forum right

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,580
we've announced at C plugfest tremendous

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,540
amount of support from the standards

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,700
community and and these harmonized

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:49,010
efforts and these collective efforts

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,720
have resulted in an amazing amazing

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,980
trillion dollar industry push so thank

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,040
you very much for doing that

00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:59,900
but let's see you know what is happening

00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,520
networking is becoming the fabric of

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,560
innovation across industries whether

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,380
it's the automotive industries and the

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,660
connected cars whether it's retail

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,940
industries and the connected stores

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,250
whether its energy and connected homes

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,520
and my favorite you know agriculture and

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,500
connected cows independent of all that

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,860
you know we're talking about carriers

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,230
cloud and enterprise networking playing

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,880
a major role in this trillion-dollar

00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,080
industry okay

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,510
and we're humbled and honored to host a

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,640
lot of these innovation at the Linux

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,610
Foundation we're hosting over 21

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,169
projects nine of the most a nine of the

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,420
ten most important projects are with

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,730
Linux Foundation Network

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:49,430
the best part is it's supported by the

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:53,490
top vendors although all of them plus a

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,950
huge delegation of end-users right and

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,250
here we're showing an example that

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:02,700
almost 70% of the mobile global

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,630
subscribers are represented by companies

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,250
participating

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,610
all right that's kind of over three

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,920
billion connections and collectively we

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,770
have created value value in terms of

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,260
dollars almost five hundred plus million

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:19,020
dollars of innovation and R&D you know

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,850
try asking your GM for that much fun to

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,110
create software it's not gonna happen

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,500
that's the power of collective

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:28,200
innovation and value in terms of

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,780
end-user innovation service creation so

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,610
really excited about this and we're not

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,830
the only one sort of trying to say that

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,100
we have you know the media and analysts

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,140
supporting us here you're showing you

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,780
know an article from Forbes that says

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,400
LFS changing the fabric of networking so

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,910
we're you know here you know that

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,250
whether the fabric is as the N + FV

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,930
orchestration virtualization automation

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,670
Orchestra cloud native doesn't matter

00:07:51,930 --> 00:08:00,260
but when you see end users in this case

00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:04,020
orange issuing RFPs that mandate you

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:06,660
know future RFPs that mandate open

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,580
source and projects like own app you can

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,740
see that entire journey and the entire

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,600
cycle come through so we're really

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,490
excited that you know some of the

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,090
leading media is picking this up and

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:20,160
then obviously the analysts are putting

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,190
out surveys so you know we just

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,090
announced this survey from our to do

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,670
group that essentially says we're which

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:33,630
industries are really going to utilize

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:36,210
the power of open source to change their

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:39,120
digital transformation and the top three

00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,740
no surprises the web techs the telecom

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,520
and fintax

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,410
and over 72% of the companies they're in

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,170
these verticals are going to rely on

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,240
open source so if you're going to focus

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:55,290
your energy and effort these are the

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:59,339
areas on on on on changing the way

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,620
these industries built for future today

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,259
we are also announcing a new survey that

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,360
came out in our space in networking from

00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,029
heavy reading and these are just some

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,860
examples of the survey please download

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:14,100
the whole survey but what we are

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,440
announcing is there are motivators for

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,240
open source networking whether its cost

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,630
savings whether it's innovation whether

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,180
its vendor lock-in or interoperability

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,880
right no surprises but the thing that

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,149
impresses and you know surprises me the

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,759
most is the open source networking is

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:35,690
prevalent all the way from CPE to the

00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,209
core all the layers of the network and

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,089
and and this is kind of the next big

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:43,949
phase of where we are heading so you

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,100
know do download this survey and you

00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:49,199
know we're really excited about that

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,980
another announcement that just happened

00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:55,819
today is about milestones that we have

00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,000
our projects have been passing through

00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:02,040
the first one is the LF networking

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,610
compliance and verification program is

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,399
now expanded it includes own app as well

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,170
as vnf certification and we're really

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,600
excited about that as we build this

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,730
program out with a bunch of vienna

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,980
vendors as well as system vendors to

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,339
make it very easy for the end users to

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,069
integrate vnf into their network and

00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,339
obviously projects are the lifeblood of

00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:29,850
of LF networking and we have projects

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:33,329
like own app showing very fancy cross

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,010
domain and cross cloud connectivity you

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:35,459
know there will be a keynote on this

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,529
tomorrow

00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,630
tungsten fabric coming up with their

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,010
little ease Fido coming up open daylight

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,829
coming up with their latest release so

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:46,170
lots of good progress on on our projects

00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:49,350
and and and so that's kind of the first

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,970
version of the Harmonized ecosystem the

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,189
second part which I want to sort of

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:58,709
introduce is that networking is shaping

00:10:53,189 --> 00:11:01,560
adjacent communities cloud edge AI IOT

00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:03,449
access no adjacent community is left

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,060
alone and here in the diagram you can

00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:08,100
see it's a telco centric view but it is

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,120
very common for cloud and enterprise as

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,639
well and

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,990
you know projects are really shaping up

00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:18,329
to move from core now to the edge and

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,059
access so the announcement we're gonna

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:23,790
make tomorrow and you know here's a

00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,649
sneak peek at some of this is what are

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,779
the applications at the edge that are

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:30,199
driving this innovation because nobody

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,519
has a good handle on that and we did a

00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:34,199
IHS did a survey on this and Michael

00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,759
Howard will talk about the entire survey

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:40,949
but the results are very promising right

00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:44,249
history is repeating itself the video of

00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:47,129
all kinds and things that are connected

00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:49,920
are the killer apps okay and we'll talk

00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:52,189
about this over the next three days so

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,629
that's kind of adjacent industries and

00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:57,389
then the last thing I want to cover here

00:11:54,629 --> 00:12:00,149
is this journey is now continuing into

00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:02,160
the cloud and we have the best of both

00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,709
worlds coming together I won't say

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,899
colliding coming together so in the

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,970
cloud world we're learning you know

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,529
portability we're learning you know

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,600
effectiveness we're learning cloud

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,879
native we're learning containerization

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,529
micro-services in the telecom world

00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:21,029
we're learning virtualization via nafs

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,699
high availability carrier grade and

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,069
we're bringing both of these together so

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,779
in order to help me out on this one I

00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:31,560
would like to bring on stage the

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:35,300
executive director of CN CF Dan Khan

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,300
[Music]

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:43,410
hey sergeant thank you Dan and what we'd

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,779
like to do is collectively here make a

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,649
simple announcement but it is a very

00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:51,120
critical announcement that two

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,209
fastest-growing open-source communities

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,870
CN CF and LFT networking are coming

00:12:54,209 --> 00:13:02,700
together to bring the cloud native

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:06,390
journey to telecom and who better to

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,089
talk about this then dan so walk us

00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,950
through you know cloud native and CN FS

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,870
and how we can take care of that great

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,110
thank you very much ARP it and I really

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:19,830
appreciate you donating five minutes of

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,180
your keynote to me I'm gonna just try

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,170
and answer this question of what is

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:27,180
cloud native and why you should care and

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,490
as Arpit said I run the sister

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,790
organization - LF networking which is

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:35,520
the cloud native computing foundation CN

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:39,149
f host kubernetes kubernetes is popular

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,480
it has more than 4500 unique authors

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:46,230
more than 23,000 people who've commented

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,200
on it to help improve it it's the second

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:53,010
fastest development velocity open-source

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:56,220
project in history number two only to

00:13:53,010 --> 00:14:00,390
Linux so um this is a look at search

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,520
traffic we the very first commit to

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,579
kubernetes was just four years ago and

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,610
it's now dramatically outpaced all the

00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:11,279
alternatives when you look at CN CF we

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,770
have an end user community with 61

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,930
companies there some amazing

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,970
organizations like Bloomberg Wikipedia

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:23,279
eBay in the New York Times we have 61

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,140
certified kubernetes service providers

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,740
these are companies that can help

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,600
end-users and we have 71 certified

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,550
kubernetes partners these are

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,570
organizations who products have passed

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:40,230
kubernetes rigorous conformance tests up

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:43,920
from 500 people at our first event three

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:47,070
years ago we had 4300 people attend Q

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,490
con cloud native con in Copenhagen a few

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:54,330
months ago and are expecting more than

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:56,940
7,000 in Seattle in December so um this

00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,190
is the keynote stage from cube con cloud

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,890
native conver Lin a year and a half ago

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:06,120
and a note that we'll be back in Europe

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:08,610
again in Barcelona in may 20 19 so let's

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:14,390
zoom in on those words behind the

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:17,220
speaker orchestration containerization

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:20,550
micro-services these three words are

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,680
simple definition of cloud native now

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,560
the CFCF community came together to

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,840
agree on a more detailed definition but

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,060
I warn you it's five very dense

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,530
sentences I'm not gonna read it all to

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:37,680
you but if you just type CN CF dot IO /

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,480
D into your phone you can see the full

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,810
definition yourself actually in both

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,660
English and Chinese but some of the just

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,630
key phrases that jump out from it public

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,360
private and hybrid clouds so a key idea

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,370
is that it's not just about the public

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,100
cloud you can actually use all of these

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,350
technologies in your own data center and

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,840
then even more powerfully you can move

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,970
your workloads from your own bare metal

00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:06,240
data center up into the public cloud and

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:09,030
back and forth service meshes is a key

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,770
technology loosely coupled systems

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:16,400
robust automation high-impact changes

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:19,440
that we have an ecosystem of open-source

00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,550
vendor-neutral projects and we're trying

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,680
to democratize state-of-the-art patterns

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,870
okay but this is a networking conference

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,900
what does any of this have to do with

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:36,150
networking so I worked for the telecoms

00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,450
mogul Craig McCaw 20 years ago

00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,790
and at the time network architecture

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,610
looked a lot like this you had a

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:49,110
physical boxes for every component

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:52,170
routers switches firewalls etc but today

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:55,620
most network architectures look like

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,350
this a modern data center network

00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,390
architecture 2.0 and so now those

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,000
physical boxes have been converted to

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,850
virtual machines called virtual net

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,329
functions or vnfs and they often run on

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:12,360
VMware or OpenStack so what are Pete and

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:15,720
I and our communities are collaborating

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,709
on is the network architecture 3.0 and

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,589
it looks like identical to the two dotto

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,709
actually the hardware is exactly the

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:28,260
same but the software is what we're

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:31,530
evolving so we're looking at cloud

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:34,710
native network functions see NFS that

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:38,730
run on kubernetes on public private or

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:40,770
hybrid clouds so let's look at that

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,020
software stack this is a networking

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,630
conference and block diagrams are the

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:50,640
kind of the coin of the realm

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:53,250
so for our own app Amsterdam you it

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,840
could run on OpenStack or VMware or

00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:00,300
Azure a Rackspace but with a Beijing you

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,820
can run on top of kubernetes which means

00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:06,870
that it can run either on bare metal or

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,390
on any cloud and then moving into the

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,120
future we think more and more of those

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,550
network functions are going to become

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,110
CNF s-- cloud native network functions

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,570
and then for the small number that

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,170
haven't been ported yet the existing

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,330
vnfs

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,700
can actually run on top of systems like

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,090
cube vert but still be controlled by

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,070
kubernetes kubernetes becomes that

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,140
consistent orchestration layer

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,690
underlying all the software and sitting

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,270
on top of either bare metal or a cloud

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,990
so why bother why are people excited

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:41,460
about this three major benefits

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,560
definitely cost savings so when you look

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,930
at a lot of enterprises today they're

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:50,040
able to run the same applications that

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:52,770
they did before on 25 or 50 percent less

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,060
hardware or of course on the existing

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:58,470
hardware they can just run more

00:18:54,060 --> 00:19:01,260
applications to improved resiliency so

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,230
individual containers can fail machines

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,350
even data centers the cloud native

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:10,230
architecture is much more dynamic much

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:13,620
more resilient and also supports auto

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:16,560
scaling in order to match the the supply

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,130
to the the current demand but really the

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,800
most

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,530
horton benefit we think is a higher

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,440
development velocity where this dynamic

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:28,530
architecture encourages you to move from

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,410
quarterly or maybe monthly updates to

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,660
daily or even dozens of times per day

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,690
and that means that your bugs get fixed

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,700
faster that new features get rolled out

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,110
where they can benefit customers it

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,140
allows you to keep up with your

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,300
competition okay but there are still

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,100
real problems and the fundamental one is

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,460
that moving the network functionality

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,700
from physical hardware to encapsulating

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:56,370
the software in a virtual machine or p2v

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,940
was generally easier than container

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:02,670
izing the software p2 C or v2 C and

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,250
that's because many vnfs rely on kernel

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,440
hacks or otherwise don't restrict

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,470
themselves to just the Linux user space

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,020
ABI now there are some real solutions to

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,360
that including the teams here working on

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,640
FD io to provide much faster packet

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,220
processing other ways of following the

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,560
rules of the user space ABI to ensure

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:26,910
that portability but there's substantial

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,610
work that we absolutely do need to do cm

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:33,570
CF is the home of kubernetes we also

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:36,360
have 17 other projects including a rook

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:40,230
a distributed storage project that's

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:44,130
going to be moving into incubation today

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,570
and a number of sandbox projects and as

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,310
you're trying to get to know this space

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,190
I do recommend taking a look at our

00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:52,500
cloud native trail map we have handouts

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,100
of this at the CN CF booth here at the

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,110
conference it's also available at LC n

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,690
CF dot IO this is our kind of

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,030
recommended path through the cloud

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,280
native landscape and it can be helpful

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,970
because the landscape can be really

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,490
overwhelming this is the over 500 open

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:16,080
source projects and closed source

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:18,240
products in this ecosystem and if you do

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,350
want to learn more you can take a look l

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,080
dot CNC F dot IO and that whole page and

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,330
app and everything is installs on your

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,230
phone or your laptop and you can play

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:33,539
with it so besides this event

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,510
and coming again in San Jose in the

00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:39,090
spring the best place to learn more

00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,639
about CNF is to come to Cuba con cloud

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,850
native con we're gonna be in Shanghai in

00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:47,639
November in Seattle in December and then

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,830
back in Europe in Barcelona in May and

00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:55,049
we'd love to see many of you and your

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:57,000
colleagues there thanks you yeah thanks

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,880
ok thank you Dan

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,820
give me a second show so let me ask you

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,460
this how can the audience get involved

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,200
in this journey absolutely and there's

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,659
kind of a lot of different threads to

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,880
it's there's not one answer three that I

00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,730
would look at is we've been

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,889
collaborating on continuous integration

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,220
which is one of the biggest areas of

00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:22,440
cloud native CN CF dot CI where we have

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,679
own app running on a number of different

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,200
public clouds I would look at a network

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,360
service mesh which you can google and

00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,240
there's a lot of interesting work there

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,190
and then own app Multi BIM going on in

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,360
the O net project very good thank you

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,360
