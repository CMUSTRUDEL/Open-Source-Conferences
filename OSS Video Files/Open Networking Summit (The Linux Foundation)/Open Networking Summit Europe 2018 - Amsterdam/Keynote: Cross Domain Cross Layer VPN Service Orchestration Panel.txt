	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,839
so the next panel on key notes is is one

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:10,500
of my favorites because the problem that

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:16,020
the panel will address in solving is one

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,180
of global connectivity for VPNs and you

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,670
know while we can always say you know

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,260
your location-based and you're sort of a

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,630
businesses is one particular city most

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,810
of us and most of the businesses operate

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,290
globally and so what we have is is we

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,969
have a very very you know senior

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,850
executives from some of the leading

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,710
companies here today we're going to talk

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,160
about you know what what they're calling

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,820
cross cloud class layer automation and

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,730
orchestration it's a it's a panel but

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,460
before we get into the Q&A on the panel

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,760
each panelists would like to share a few

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,109
ideas and thoughts and and a few slides

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,460
let me introduce the panel and then I'll

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,650
bring the first one in so dr. Fang is

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,479
from China Mobile she's the chief

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,030
scientist and general manager of the AI

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,560
and intelligent operations at their CMCC

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,930
R&D center bill ran is from Huawei he's

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,049
VP of network industry and eco systems

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,850
and then Fran Iran he's the head of

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,030
cloud and automation group at the

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,280
Vodafone group and so what we'll do is

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,009
I'll bring in a friend first and then he

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,900
will bring in the speakers and then

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,140
we'll have a Q&A session so Frank come

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,140
on out

00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:43,350
[Music]

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,870
good morning and thank you for joining

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,760
us so I'm Fran heron is our Pichette I

00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,120
head up the claritin automation center

00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,040
of excellence for Vodafone Group we're

00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,560
going to talk about own app and a

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,020
contribution that a collaboration that

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,970
we've done over the last six months in

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,550
contributing to own app in a use case

00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,990
that's very near and dear to our hearts

00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:08,959
and Vodafone and I'll talk about that as

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:11,850
well so we joined own app and then lfn

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,990
little over a year ago and in looking to

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,459
where we could contribute into this open

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,900
source program it's not an area where

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,670
typically Vodafone has been active

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,890
before but it's one that we're we're

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,620
changing we looked at a particular

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,680
problem not specific to us but certainly

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,840
very relevant for Vodafone and it's one

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,790
based on geography and they say a

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,410
picture speaks a thousand words and only

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,020
have five minutes I'm gonna use pictures

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,209
rather than words so this is this is

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,030
Vodafone's footprint for those that

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,700
aren't aware so everything from I guess

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:48,120
Ireland in the West all the way over to

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,739
New Zealand's in the east and lots of

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,900
different territories in between and

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,660
I've colored it all red but the truth is

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,850
actually they're all different operating

00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,430
companies different histories different

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,320
heritage different market drivers local

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,019
market conditions but within the

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,790
Vodafone group you know this is the this

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,140
is the scale and the span that we have

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,480
and in looking to introduce cloud

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,360
automation across the group you know

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,920
looking for levels of consistency across

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,330
across all of our territories is going

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,549
to be a key part of our strategy going

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,739
forward what many of you may not know

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:23,310
though is we also have a very extensive

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,940
partner market ecosystem which looks

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,280
like this and these are operators in

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,220
markets where we don't have a physical

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,350
presence or offer a service but we do

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,890
work very closely with these partners on

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,920
strategy on technology and it you know

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,890
expands I guess our visibility in our

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,709
reach even further across the world and

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,840
then finally there's a third layer to

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,140
this which is a very extensive

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,910
enterprise business that Vodafone has

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,280
where we sell enterprise connectivity

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,840
services and value-added services like

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,170
unified communications and collaboration

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,660
tools in an even more extensive set of

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:07,440
geographies I'm pretty much giving us a

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,960
global footprint and in particular on

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,010
the enterprise services as we look at

00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,450
automation and this was really the

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,340
driver behind the collaboration that

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,900
we've done with China Mobile and with

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,810
wild wayne we're contributing into the

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,019
next release of own app and Casablanca

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,000
it was really about not just focusing on

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,680
inside a single domain as we look to

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,800
automation and build our clouds

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,400
it's about cross-domain so it's equally

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,110
important that we have the end-to-end

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,840
automation between regions between

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,390
markets between carriers especially for

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,250
the consumer facing services Enterprise

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,700
in particular so if you're going to have

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,010
a truly automated you know digital

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,460
customer experience very important we

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,230
have no breaks in that process between

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,400
our markets between our partner markets

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,330
and where we're selling Enterprise

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,370
Services as well

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,190
so there was really three key drivers

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,140
for us in Vodafone and I go I go

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,990
actually right-to-left on this the first

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,550
is automation and I've mentioned that so

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,530
I think at the same time as we're

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,590
focusing on how do we automate within a

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,180
single market single territory both on

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,340
the network but also on the consumer

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,050
facing services equally important we

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,840
stay focused and how we automate across

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,330
territories right so north-south if you

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,210
will within a single domain east-west

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,680
going across domains and that's about

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,930
really reducing the time to market

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,550
changing the customer experience putting

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,710
the customer more in control giving them

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,110
more choice so key we have that that

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,660
end-to-end automation experience second

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,729
area and I mentioned traditionally I

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,620
suppose many of us in the industry are

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,210
very standards driven but open source is

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,100
playing a much more important role now

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,800
as we transform our networks and build

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,590
our clouds so the agility we get from

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,600
that and being able to move faster

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,700
define the standards quickly and

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
iteration is becoming increasingly

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,300
important not just for us and Vodafone

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,820
but I think for the industry in general

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,430
and it's very much a mix of traditional

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,950
standards but also very much augmented

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,980
now by by open source including

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,170
projects like onap and you know if you

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,370
look at the the pace of change that's

00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,950
happened even in the last 12 months

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,480
since we first joined it's been very

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,450
dramatic in terms of driving those

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,100
standards and finally this is really

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,470
important for us because this isn't the

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,910
first exercise at a driving cross-domain

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,770
interoperability via API we've actually

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,540
we've used a lot of that prior work as

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,300
well but the out-of-the-box experience

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,600
is key and for us I think if we leave

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,440
too much as an exercise to the user to

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,380
add and augment the scope for variation

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,000
and breakage increases dramatically as

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,190
you look across all of those territories

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,400
I showed so having cross domain

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:56,310
interoperability for services out of the

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,770
box on a platform like onap was a

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,750
critical driver for us as well so we'll

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,700
we'll talk during the panel more about

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,650
the contributions that were making but

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,890
certainly it signals and this isn't you

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,170
know the end of the of the collaboration

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,790
it's the beginning of our inputs into

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,160
the open source community unknown app in

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,470
particular very much with a focus on

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,490
what we can bring as a global operator

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:23,610
with multi domain requirements into a

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,070
program like own app so that's our

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,680
motivation I'd like to invite on stage

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,060
now bill Ren from Huawei one of our

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,070
partners in the collaboration to maybe

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,900
take us through what was your

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,340
motivations on this as well thanks Bill

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,560
okay thanks for Francie introduction

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,420
morning everyone my name is Ren student

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,940
and from Huawei I'm in charge of the

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,070
open source business in networking

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,770
infrastructure in the next few minutes

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,920
I'd like to share with you our thought

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:56,580
about network automation so you can see

00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:00,120
my topic is a tensor network so is

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,960
providing into a service manufacturer so

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,900
first let's let's look at the history of

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,990
this manufacturer actually is a history

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,480
of efficiency so 2,000 years ago the

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,570
handicraft stage the bloom attica thing

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,570
is a terracotta warriors so in this

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,090
stage the efficiencies patent law

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,060
you have to meet one by one but if you

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:26,250
have been too shy so you will find out

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,900
that each terracotta warriors is unique

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:33,510
you customized so in nineteen in 1768

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,270
the Chinese men emotion stand for the

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:40,740
second stage the massive manufacturer

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,900
stage began in 1908 the fourth empty is

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,090
produced in streamlined protectin life

00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,810
so all this increased efficiency more

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:53,070
than ten times with single products in

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:56,040
1955 the Madonna makes the food so is

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,650
kind of a manufacture industry with

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,430
field types of menu so in the second

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:06,510
stage the efficiency is higher but as a

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:10,770
product a few so start from EWS in 2006

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:13,110
the cloud business maker builds a new

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,720
stage post the efficiency of the

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,390
products are much more hair so we call

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,940
it a service manufacturers stage so

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:25,940
according the bombers love across the

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:29,220
disease since the cost of those industry

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,050
which is labor-intensive will continue

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,110
to rise due to the increase the

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,400
efficiency of the manufacturing industry

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:40,140
so the those we are lost their

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:42,780
competitiveness so we have seen many

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,810
industries also already into the service

00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,760
manufacture for example this cloud has

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,450
transferred the traditional IT into a

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,910
new IT service a new manufacturer the

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:57,030
you commercial transfers and traditional

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,220
retail to the new retail service

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,340
manufacture even the logistical

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,420
warehousing is transformed to automated

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:09,600
a protector line with run by robots and

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,400
also the car as we all know has entered

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,620
into the intelligent manufacturing stage

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,440
the different commands by different the

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,760
user could be made in the same protector

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,790
so naturally we would like to ask why

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,170
not the network service industry

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:30,810
transferred to the so it's manufacture

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,470
of course we are not imitating so why

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:37,660
why we show the transfer

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:41,610
this network service industry so on one

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:46,560
hand from custom upon vo we have said

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:49,450
networker skill we are concealed to

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,220
expending it is expected that we'll

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:57,120
reach 75 billion connections in 2025 so

00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,220
the network complexity beyond as a human

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,060
capabilities and also the quality of the

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,670
network service is mainly driven by

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,910
customer complaints also on the other

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:12,130
hand the objects increase faster than

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,770
the revenue so it I need only three

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,430
people for duty to maintain 10,000 the

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:21,850
devices but for operators in it neither

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:25,690
300 so there's more than 100 different

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,610
terms of difference in efficiency so

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,980
that's why we say you need the system

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,580
architecture innovation too so this

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,220
structure problems so that it that's why

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,130
it's necessary to transform the network

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:43,360
service industry from labor-intensive to

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:45,850
a service manufacture industry so how to

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,880
transform so refer to the architecture

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,450
of this intelligent and manufacturing of

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:54,700
vehicle so we can see first you need a

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,820
flexible program for material handling

00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,610
in the bottom about that fab software

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:04,330
system is needed so you can see the pads

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,710
control system assembly management and

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,530
the quality management system and the

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:12,820
top is design supporting system as well

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:14,830
as the modeling similarly so 4 stf a has

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,800
in the past 10 years 10 the networking

00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,200
into a programmable infrastructure with

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,560
the we have a marketplace input 2 as a

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,830
input so again there are far more system

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,340
is required to about that

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:32,200
controllers service Oxygen's

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:37,650
policy-based the closed-loop and the

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:40,930
designer as well as this modeling so

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:43,180
look at onab the architecture fits to

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,329
this service manufacture architecture

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,389
very well so we believe on i

00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:52,389
is the most promising community in

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,920
network industry that's why we join

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,350
hands with water Fernando channel

00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,129
Marbella to build this use case in the

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,679
community the CVP proof-of-concept shows

00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:06,309
that the service manufacturer is

00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:08,499
feasible in our industry so the

00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:10,809
corollary of the owner is a common

00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:13,119
engineering language helps our Sri party

00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,670
to assemble this routine so is in

00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:19,600
streamline so that's all for my pant

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,790
okay so with that more detail this

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,569
system in use case you could visit us in

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,009
our bows and we regard you that thank

00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:29,470
you for your attention that I'd like to

00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:36,779
invite dr. Fung from China Mobile to

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:36,779
talk about their thinking okay thank you

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:42,369
sir good morning

00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,610
I'm nudist community so I carry my badge

00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:49,959
everywhere I'm gentle I'm from China

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,850
Mobile firmly III a bank run and there's

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,649
the first time my life and come to a

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,559
stage was two gentlemen sitting behind

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:59,319
giving me a love of protection so quick

00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,600
you guys safer here thanks to to our

00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:05,829
partner Howie and the Vodafone thanks to

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,980
happen so today I'm new share with you

00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:11,379
just a couple of minutes and what's what

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,410
our recent changes in site on mobile and

00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:19,629
what we do is own up and where we are

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:21,790
heading so inside ty mobile from last

00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:25,360
year and this year we dramatically

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:28,329
increased our investment on network of

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,230
transformation internally which referred

00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:34,860
to the whole effort as novanet it has

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,119
three layers infrastructure layer

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,989
application layer and a management layer

00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:44,589
we can do everything our own so I

00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:47,410
highlighted the boxes the components we

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,749
wear which those are the ones we

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,029
concentrate on on the bottom layers the

00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:56,230
white box switches and the cloud based

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:58,480
OS the vim on the top on the management

00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,950
layer for caught the super controller

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,910
cross domain controller

00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:06,760
wing of em and EMS and we do take

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:09,519
Orchestrator and our own next version of

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:14,250
OSS as the core as a bringer of the

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:18,790
network for automation for intelligence

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,500
this is how we try this moment from this

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,890
month and last month we have been put

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:29,589
into lots of efforts to push some

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:31,990
functions of onap into trial no to this

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:37,149
one on the picture is that when we take

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:39,519
the Amsterdam vote Evo LTE use case and

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:41,620
we'd run a trial in Georgian province

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,860
the general is one of the richest

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:49,029
province in china the other ones we take

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:52,480
it enough we owe from the VFC into trial

00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,160
we run a tri own Shaanxi so hopefully i

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,480
have those two trials will learn a

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,820
lesson so you can put into will use

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:05,230
their we we struggle same as the

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:07,240
community when we deploy onap our

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,850
business there are lots of challenges

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,829
though so I just listed three because

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,149
there is a using number for you to

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:16,899
remember

00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:20,529
so the massive codebase the complexity

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:22,720
and the stability and whenever the

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:25,510
difficulty to put into any new use case

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,839
and we look forward to working with you

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:32,410
all and just to improve that to make a

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:37,690
more modular eyes flexible and make it

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:41,470
more kind of use case driven that's on

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:46,089
up another strategic a change inside

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:50,800
China Mobile is we really think making a

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:54,910
network intelligent is important so as a

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:58,029
reflection of that earlier of this year

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,769
we formed a new R&D centre it's the

00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,230
called artificial intelligence I

00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,370
intelligent operation Rd Center that's

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,910
why I'm here

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:10,600
so and when clean stocks consolidate the

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:13,179
stuff on two sides we have from last

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,810
year in this year we have deployed a few

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,339
application

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:19,400
some of the largest skills some of or

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,650
not yet and we mean looking in the for

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,839
future we hope this can be more

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,800
systematic a way of really making the

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,800
network intelligent

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,990
the third point to make is a

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,220
collaboration because CCP PN is really I

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,470
personally I think our team really

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:40,580
enjoyed the working with cell phone and

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:44,920
hallway so in the past they sto and

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,720
assert working as a mulligans with

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,110
document driven each iteration takes

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,050
years took a year years to go to the

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:58,130
next one and then now it's open source

00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:01,270
that can happen and months and I think

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:04,640
it's in order to have a more stable

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:07,910
component the team need to come closer

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,920
so it's more community driven that's the

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:13,010
way we work we came up with this idea we

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,770
talked to last time in Los Angeles right

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,840
and then was back in March and informed

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:24,110
my team worked together really happy to

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:27,140
see where we are now so this is because

00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:30,950
my tied the title I named Nancy CVP and

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,510
beyond so although it's in the if you go

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,490
to the own Apple website is a Cal

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:37,760
cross-domain cross layer actually

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:40,280
another one is a cross operator so back

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,220
to march of the CI remember there's a

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,790
company called keep safe in Los Angeles

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:52,250
they have a market slogans that the VPN

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:54,530
is too hard for fluffy lady brain so now

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,860
we have many ladies working behind to

00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,470
come up a new way of doing VPN so I

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,830
really encourage you to find a more

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:07,790
details on our booth it's truly model

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:10,430
based which is a key of own app and it

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,410
has a couple processes you can come to

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,060
the booth and learn details I can I

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:18,950
think it would probably well cover in

00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:23,510
the QA for some of the details okay with

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:26,050
that and Anna back to you thank you very

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,050
much

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,680
all right so this is really you know

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:38,610
very fascinating and you know especially

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:41,430
it's not just the multi site it's multi

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,580
operator multi country

00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:47,610
it's it's a it's a great great showcase

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,230
of how you know not just providers but

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,840
providers and vendors can come together

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,330
and collaborate in open source I

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,940
particularly like one thing dr. Fang

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,760
which was you you put on a pin

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,550
production in the richest province so I

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,950
think that one up right so will will

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,860
probably sort of have others do that in

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,470
it anyway so I would like to go ahead

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,450
and sort of you know ask a few questions

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:18,120
if that's okay the first one is you know

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,280
clearly this is done as kind of a demo

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,850
and it's it's live in the booth

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,950
how how is each one of you and your

00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,309
teams how they're going to contribute

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,530
back to you know the open source team

00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:34,320
and and more importantly you know how

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,000
many people roughly house how big you

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,140
know if you can give us an idea on that

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,860
so that you know the rest of the

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,000
community can can benefit ok lady first

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,300
yeah absolutely

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,990
ok so I will answer part of it otherwise

00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:52,020
that they don't have anything to say so

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,809
we work the world they're the source

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:58,679
code it definitely will go back I said

00:20:54,809 --> 00:21:01,500
so I so and AI I think what we can

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:08,420
contribute back is also the the modules

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:12,300
the the workflow the configuration and

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:15,210
the onboarding process so I think with

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:18,390
that in place wherever once you do

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,910
something similar you not just the the

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:25,140
code base also this modules that can be

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,880
reused okay I think for us and I mean

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,240
our team at Vodafone is still relatively

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,130
small working on this as I said in my

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,620
opening remarks it's traditionally an

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,540
area we haven't been massively active in

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,790
before but that will that will change so

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,710
this is this is very much the beginning

00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,980
a process for us I think the big

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,810
contribution is is the api's and you can

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,560
see it here on the diagram so that that

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:51,870
east-west cross operator across domain

00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,250
set of api's is a really important part

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,740
of the contribution having those out of

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,080
the box very important to us their data

00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,280
models and the API is are designed

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,810
really to be used not just for a

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,510
particular service it should be it

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,950
should be multi service and then dr.

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,440
Feng's point the data models and the

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,150
artifacts within that used to represent

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,250
a VPN service in this case is being

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,320
contributed back into wound up and also

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,910
updates to the user interface for the

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,400
ordering process as well so it's a

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,590
pretty extensive range I guess of

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,450
contributions and it's a you know one we

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,980
keep iterating through and growing our

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,130
development team and Vodafone on this as

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:30,270
well so it's really an even nothing for

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:33,120
me okay I agree yes

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,330
source code api is most important also

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,730
as we all know own app is a framework

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:41,370
but um for this framework as a use case

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,620
driven the most important so the beauty

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:47,100
of this DC VPN use case is first time

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:50,790
the industry join hands to make the OT

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:54,330
st ones this underlay overlay so is work

00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:57,870
together to drive this service modeling

00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:01,110
the interface hoc we contribute back to

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:04,050
the community so any people who is

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:07,110
willing to do this practice can take

00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:10,680
advantage of those contributions to do

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:13,410
their POC so that's one thing I have to

00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,660
mention and also regarding the

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,030
modularity of contribution as you all

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,820
know how as a second largest contributor

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:26,580
for this community and also almost each

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:31,650
each module releases this VP from s SDC

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:34,290
to ISO to Dae policy we have C and all

00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,820
those modules has been in coward so each

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,250
module

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,020
supported is a use case so very good

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,320
very good no this is great because I

00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:45,860
think one of the one of the slides dr.

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,370
Fang had a was a collaboration between

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:52,110
SDOs and and open source and a lot of

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,850
these are kind of you know evolving

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,450
towards

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,130
MEF api's as well that that the

00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,900
collaboration has already been set up so

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,020
you know we're really excited so that's

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:08,559
great very good how do you how do you

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:11,299
envision sort of the onap / open source

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,860
enabling you to digitally transform the

00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:15,710
company so now we're talking about like

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,510
a next layer up trans transformation

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,360
problem you know in terms of not just

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:23,480
now but future plants you know friend

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,400
you want to go first maybe sure no it's

00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,100
it's and I said it you know earlier it's

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,600
it's becoming increasingly important for

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,370
especially as we do Claire in automation

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,380
it's not an area traditionally covered

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,660
by you know traditional standards I

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,790
guess it's not just with owner but

00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,309
across all the layers of our of our

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,410
cloud stack open-source is playing an

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,630
increasingly important role I think for

00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,220
us there's a few challenges I think in

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,260
the industry as well one is the sheer

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,780
range of open-source projects can be a

00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,520
problem so on one hand you have this you

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,640
know very broad scope great range of

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,130
programs but it can be hard to pick

00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,080
which one to use so I think there's some

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,400
work we need to do there and the other

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,080
key thing that we're focused on is

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,340
making it focused on stability and

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,400
robustness right so there's always

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,830
something we say in in balancing the

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,200
feature function richness with making

00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,460
sure at every point in time it's fit for

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,630
service ready for global deployments so

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,340
it's an increasingly important part of

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,110
our transformation program it's

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,490
something we'll balance with traditional

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:28,340
standards but very very focused on

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:31,750
readiness and stability and having that

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,340
that correct balance between both okay

00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,530
okay

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:40,700
so I talk a part of our efforts how we

00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:43,700
push on up into real use I'm thinking is

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:47,360
one side we do increase our R&D

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:51,919
investment on this line of research and

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,600
death I also want to point out is there

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,260
are two things one is that we really

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,299
need to focus away we can build our own

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,840
trajectory we cannot take it the whole

00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:05,480
thing and transform whatever existing

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,090
now you have to increment wholly find a

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,760
path

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:11,370
the path has to when the trusts are from

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,260
the business so that level of trust I'm

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,440
thinking is very important

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,140
another point I want makers although

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,590
it's open-source but it's not a like

00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,760
open source in regular sense I guess

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,800
then you have it on up

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,380
it's kind of small piece of software you

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,750
you can give up how you can someone

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,150
download and use I'm thinking own app is

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:36,390
it's a software but it's going to

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:39,120
transform in the industry so I just hope

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,700
with the audience's we you know hold our

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,490
patience because any business

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:49,470
transformation cannot be as easy as

00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:52,430
installing a software so yeah especially

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:55,820
the people part you know people the the

00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:58,200
organization the way to work together

00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,210
I'm thinking we're doing something great

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,060
for the future very good very good

00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:06,060
bill yeah thought so talk about the open

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:08,310
source I think as I mentioned it's a for

00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,470
me own APIs as a common engineering

00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,720
language I hope to see a king it's

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,420
really improved the efficiency of our

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,510
collaboration you know the surprise to

00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:21,570
me is I think two weeks ago I made our

00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,790
team May 12 our customers team the

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,310
engineers system engineer work together

00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,860
even the never meet before but as you

00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,410
can talk him in model arity level in

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,160
interface level just because of own app

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:38,820
so that make me feel is surprised so

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,650
because you know expand explain the

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,770
terminology for each company it's really

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,930
hard so everyone has a big program so

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:49,620
how to let the industry understand your

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:52,950
program is very tough and where is very

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,270
low efficiency second I think is a open

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,970
source gave us a new way of a

00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,850
collaboration as I mentioned I was a

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:03,090
party this is between use case itself

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,410
would prove that it's it's possible for

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,240
the future for the majesty of

00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,540
collaboration with even without and know

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,330
each other so the weekend marketplace is

00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,680
really expected in the industry so we

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,020
should have make that happen

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,320
very good very good no this is great let

00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,130
me ask one one more here and and I think

00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,930
all of us

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,510
No you know there's I have this theory

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:28,260
right that if there are a hundred things

00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:30,180
about the product or service and 99 of

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,460
them are like really good and then

00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,950
there's that one bad thing or maybe a

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:38,100
challenge the engineer will zoom in and

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:41,040
focus on that but if you're a marketeer

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,540
and if there are 99 bad things and that

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,610
one good thing the market here will

00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,520
focus on that one good thing right so

00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:51,120
let's put a hand engineer hat on and

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,340
kind of ask you know the panel here what

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,770
are the challenges in deployment right

00:28:53,340 --> 00:29:00,270
maybe start with Bill in the Senate I

00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,060
think of course we are part of the

00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:05,540
industry I'd like to share is for me

00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,160
look at of the journey in the past

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:11,280
especially for city pins with the

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,620
several months I think as a I would

00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:17,130
prefer more lesson learned from what we

00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:21,480
caught correct the most important is the

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:23,970
senior executive sponsorship for this uh

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:28,020
narrative rahmatan is most important for

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:30,000
me because for me own app is more than

00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,220
just a software it's a system or it's

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,930
Jasmine I don't think it's just another

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:39,330
OSS so it's ready to Peapod process to

00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:41,670
business transformation so it's how to

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,180
be strategy driven and the top-down

00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:47,430
driven otherwise you don't have

00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:50,370
sustainable progress you may make some

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:52,440
progress but it's never go far so second

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:54,930
of thing I think the real scenario real

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,230
problem solving is most important so

00:29:54,930 --> 00:30:02,790
that's why we have this situation in

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:05,070
place and except that I think within

00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,870
each organizations and multiple

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,100
department across department

00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:15,270
collaborations most important because

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:18,240
how to put involves a real user within

00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:21,330
each organization such as four carriers

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,260
as a network a department of operation

00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:27,120
department embodying up in the very

00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,910
first beginning it's very important

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,820
otherwise the Univision always stay on

00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,570
the lab its network of go anywhere those

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,320
are those are gray

00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:41,660
lessons how about you dr. thing I think

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:44,370
I covered part over that I'm thinking is

00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:47,070
first there are several level it's a one

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,200
level is own app itself this newbie you

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,410
need to be more stable

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,450
it's need to be increased a then the

00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,790
easiness of use because if on now

00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,770
everyone takes on up to take substantial

00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:02,700
efforts really make it work hopefully

00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:06,240
that can be become easier and second

00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:09,420
level is we you know each company has

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,700
their own spec requirements needs to

00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,830
take it out as a core and work

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,260
effectively to meet to the internal

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,200
requirements that kind of efficiency

00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:23,220
also it's very important another level

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm thinking is the the collaboration

00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,830
internal external and internal

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,050
collaboration so we have to teach other

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,930
parts of the company where the R&D and

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:37,260
the network operation and construction

00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:39,710
have to they feel comfortable so we do

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,940
quite a lot of kind of tutorials

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,860
presentations so they'll learn details

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,440
of what they'll actually learn what an

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:50,330
app is do that level of trust

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,310
I think external is we needed to improve

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:56,250
the way we the efficiency of our

00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,350
collaboration in the community I'm

00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,690
thinking as if we you know we have our

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:03,450
own use case other operators has their

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:06,420
own use case I'm thinking if we can work

00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,670
on something for probably even for a

00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,970
short period of time if we can share a

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:13,950
common goal we truly laser focus on that

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,780
to really make it happen I'm thinking

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,730
that love that kind of a collaboration

00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,160
is also important which is what you're

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:23,010
showing here which is showing example

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,140
exam excel and friend you know lessons

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,670
learned yeah what to add that's why I

00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,770
agree completely with with all the

00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,060
points I think maybe an important

00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,560
clarification from Vodafone's

00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,050
perspective when we talk about open

00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,050
source because carriers are all

00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:38,670
different in in in their approach this

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,900
isn't about us taking the code out of

00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,730
the codebase and deploying it ourselves

00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,150
and building it ourselves we still very

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:47,320
much rely on our vendor partners in this

00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,720
space open source is a great way to

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,420
get to standards and and and

00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,760
interoperability but I think the

00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,630
challenges we're seeing is the speed of

00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,030
vendor adoption

00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:01,990
the speed at which vendors are in the

00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:04,450
case of onap for example taking onap and

00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,280
applying you know the api's and data

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,960
models to their portfolios and then

00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,720
bringing that back in to us that there's

00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,010
a hardened robust platform to help

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,320
address the you know the overall

00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,630
complexity and quality issues so it's an

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,100
opportunity I guess in an open call to

00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,600
the vendor community one of whom we have

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,700
on stage obviously but there's others in

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,480
the audience I think we need to increase

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,940
the pace at at embracing openness as we

00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,830
do cloud across operators you know

00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,750
openness is the foundational element of

00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,400
everything we're doing an open source

00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,280
can help drive that obviously and I

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,170
think to dr. Frank's point we need more

00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,610
carrier inputs as well right so we've

00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,980
this collaboration has been great over

00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:44,230
the last six months each of us took our

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,030
own particular experiences and

00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,190
requirements and applied it into the

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,330
collaboration now we need more inputs

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,620
from other carriers because their

00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:52,750
requirements will be different as well

00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,550
so I think those two would be the key

00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,400
for us in terms of how quickly and how

00:33:54,550 --> 00:34:01,020
fast we can adopt and deploy this within

00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:03,670
the network very good I think we are

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,190
almost out of time I would like to point

00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:09,910
out that there are sessions here that

00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:13,810
you should attend plus obviously visit

00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:16,960
our visit the booth out there and then

00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,850
there are experts from the vendor from

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,950
the community that that can answer any

00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,810
technical questions I know tons of

00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,300
developers here so you know please

00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,100
please stop by here and with that I

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,420
would like to thank the panel please

00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:33,260
give a big round of applause

00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,260
