Description: 
	Keynote: An Open Approach: Virtualizing the CO for Mobile Services - Heather Kirksey, Vice President, Ecosystem & Community, The Linux Foundation; Qiao Fu, Project Manager, China Mobile; Azhar Sayeed & Hanen Garcia, Red Hat

With the latest developments in orchestration tools and SDN controllers, inbuilt capabilities for a virtualized central office are now available to create solutions that support the delivery of residential, business and mobile services. Building on the Virtual Central Office concept debuted last year at the OPNFV Summit in Beijing that demonstrated both residential and enterprise services, the VCO Demo 2.0 has evolved to mobile services by focusing on the implementation of vRAN (virtual radio access network) as well as the virtualized mobile packet core elements (vEPC) which represent a minimum viable mobile access network configuration. The demo will highlight the collaborative power of open source communities to innovate and collaborate around one of the industry’s most pressing use cases. A portfolio of demo assets will be made available to the community to help replicate the demo in their own environments.

good afternoon ons I am so glad to see

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,240
you all here it was really great to sort

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,429
of see where we've come I was very lucky

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,740
to be a part of some of those events in

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,949
the past and I'm happy to be here today

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,250
in our evolution

00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:23,160
so as Arpit mentioned I'm Heather

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,930
Kirksey I am the VP of ecosystem and

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,660
community for the LF networking

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,720
portfolio of projects a previous to this

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,730
I was the executive director of OPN Fe

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,450
so I remember some of those scenes that

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:40,950
we just saw and today we are going to go

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,290
through a virtual central office demo so

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,180
just a little bit about VCO it's a topic

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,420
that people have been talking about for

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,280
a while and in fact VCO and edge are

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,850
going to be the topics of a few more

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,129
presentations later today but you know

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,890
one of the important things as we've you

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,949
know continued our NFV journey is the

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,890
importance of sort of getting all these

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:07,170
services out closer and closer to our

00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,720
consumers so you know the service

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,790
providers are looking at using the

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,700
existing real estate that they have in

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,130
their central offices and modernizing

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,470
those and deploying residential

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,600
enterprise and mobile services to

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,350
improve efficiency customer experience

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,200
improve cost yeah when this journey

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,640
started you know when we were we started

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,430
looking at the data center and in the

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,770
central office came to be a place that

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,740
was very important and when we started

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,299
this activity here the central office

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,250
was in need of a lot of modernization

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,369
you know the hardware was very bespoke

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,930
it was very monolithically integrated

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,119
there weren't a lot of standard

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,500
interfaces and over the past several

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,960
years I think we've made a lot of

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,530
progress around virtualizing that

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,390
looking at what happens if you have you

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,549
know commodity Hardware regular white

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,250
box Hardware both in switching and in

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,119
the servers and we started the software

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,680
defining a lot of aspects of that and

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,310
looking ahead

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,209
obviously cloud native becomes important

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,740
orchestrating things and a more

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,420
efficient fashion so we're

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,670
moving from sort of you know a smaller

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,150
number of data centers to huge numbers

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,260
of central offices and even more edge

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:27,150
locations and so you know within OPN fe

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,310
and many of our upstream partners you

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,620
know we've been looking to look at how

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,190
we can solve those problems for our end

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,600
users so when we started this journey we

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,060
had a lot of our operators you know

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,580
asking us with an O PMF e to start

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,500
looking at this so last year just a

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,950
little over a year ago we showed our

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,410
first version of this journey in

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,570
virtualizing the central office from an

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,780
Opie nfe perspective at our summit in

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,300
Beijing it was focused on residential

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,220
and enterprise use cases and we really

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,990
focused on sort of that first aspect

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,740
which was the onboarding of a lot of

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,680
traditional residential and enterprise

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,650
use cases onto the open source platform

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,160
so on the residential side we looked at

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,770
bringing a virtual B and G online on top

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,380
of an open source platform built out of

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,390
OpenStack and open daylight and other

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,520
open source pieces and then we also

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,190
showed something similar with the

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,670
enterprise use cases we showed a virtual

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:33,090
CPE and some firewalling and other use

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,640
cases of that sort so looking ahead this

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,460
year we wanted to look at mobile use

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,740
cases you know mobile you know sort of

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,650
to round out the trio but also as we

00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,390
look ahead at 5g the residential

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,660
enterprise use cases they've got really

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,630
good business models behind them but for

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,360
5g it really becomes a necessity to move

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,110
things further out to get closer to our

00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,260
consumers so we can meet the latency

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,910
requirements of the of the use cases

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,230
that we're looking to do there so things

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,970
like autonomous vehicles drones AR vr so

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,240
the demo that you are going to see today

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:16,230
focuses on that sort of Telkom Network

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:20,700
edge area and the sort of the access

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:23,100
evolution from LTE to 5g so we're going

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,550
to be setting up an end to end network

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,620
with a next-generation core you're going

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,940
to see some just

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,590
aggregating access and a full fear an

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,229
implementation and you're going to see

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:40,220
some live connectivity happen here on

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:41,570
stage I wish I could say that all of you

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,760
should look under your seats and you're

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,040
going to find some AR VR goggles for

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,169
that kind of use case I however do not

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,040
have over a Winfrey's money so we will

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:54,229
be doing a mobile use case and then

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,300
before I go any further just we are

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:59,630
doing a live code with a live connection

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:05,270
between here and California so send us

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:07,669
good energy and please be kind with that

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,010
I would like to bring out a food Chow

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:12,139
from China Mobile who's very active in

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,750
the OPN Fe community she is on the Oh

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,910
FINA feet ESC and she is going to talk

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,539
to us a little bit about China Mobile's

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,820
vision of the next generation mobile

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:26,150
network and how some of this work from

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,410
open Fe and the demo fit into that so it

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,330
will be great to hear the perspective

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,520
from the world's largest mobile operator

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,520
thank you for child thank you hey sir

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,889
so good afternoon I'm food shelf from

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,560
China Mobile China Mobile we try to

00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,919
structure our future network into what

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,490
we call ticks telecom integrated cloud

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:52,190
ticks basically they are providing and

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,190
using the cloud technologies including

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,229
in a VSD and to provide this virtualized

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,000
environment for future virtualized next

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:04,729
door functions we categorize tics into

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,310
cortex and a shtick in which cortex they

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:11,300
are located in some centralized

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,750
locations and basically support control

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,300
plane surfaces and ash ticks are

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:20,139
deployed distributed in large numbers of

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,580
country in cities and countries and

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:26,120
support user plain surfaces and ash

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,310
services so this kind of act actor

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,220
actually brings our network like into

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,349
ends and a core and a cortex and it

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,539
seems like that the the number of the

00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:38,330
ticks will be very small but in each

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:40,820
tick there will be a huge scale and in

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,569
the edge ticks there will be comparable

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,439
a small scale

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:48,439
clouds but the number will be huge with

00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,409
this architecture actually results with

00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,779
new requirements and expectations for

00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:57,189
the future network for example we would

00:06:53,779 --> 00:07:00,589
like to have the OpenStack to have

00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:03,490
management of a massive distributed ash

00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:06,110
cloud and also we expect our common

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:10,279
deployment models from the core to the

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,349
ash and also we would like to have not

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,319
only opens that but also kubernetes into

00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:19,449
our clouds so that we could have stacks

00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:22,819
to support continuous vnf services and

00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:25,550
we also expected the stack to be agile

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:28,729
and flexible and also they should have

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,589
telco levels of service assurance so

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:34,369
that we could support all the different

00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:35,899
kinds of telco services and an - an

00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:38,209
orchestration is something very

00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:40,029
important to us so that we could use one

00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:43,849
auto straighter from the core to the ash

00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:45,860
so we are expecting that o pmf we could

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:48,469
provide us with list reference platform

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,769
which have all these fancy capabilities

00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:54,439
to support our future network we expect

00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:58,089
a lot for the VCO demo especially this

00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:00,769
time for VCO 2 dot o beyond just the

00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:03,139
residents and enterprise the use cases

00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:06,379
this time we have two mobile use cases

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:09,050
which a mobile core and mobile ash and

00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,699
we hope that this kind of demo can drive

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,680
some of the work in the community and

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,849
also provides us more experience and

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,219
test tools for food for the integration

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:22,189
and testing of the future networks so

00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:23,629
with that let me bring Azure on to the

00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:25,819
stage with more details for the

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,969
architecture and the demo work T cell

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,969
door

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:35,770
thank you so much so the requirements

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,229
that food child just laid out for you

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,360
translated into a long list of you know

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,700
things that we needed to do a for a demo

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,710
and from the different service providers

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,910
we got interested in showing vir on

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,959
showing packet core of showing IMS

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,600
particularly some of the things that

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,220
were interest was to show the splits

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,800
based architecture that's actually

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,870
defined in 5g but with the 4G radio and

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,490
things like network slicing in edge

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,050
compute so the laundry list ran very

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,750
long and we started to actually now

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,010
assemble together a team and different

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,070
vendors to come together and actually

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,470
build this particular demo obviously our

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,970
goal was to try to show as much as we

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,630
can but this time around we were just

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,070
focusing a lot more on the VM demo

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,899
that's we use the exact same

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,670
architecture that was defined as part of

00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,190
easier one dot others so it's the exact

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,080
same stack now with that stack of course

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,910
with because this is a new different use

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,860
case and you have new set of partners to

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,950
the part of this particular stack people

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,110
like Expo people like you know Quartus

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,730
an open-air interface which is actually

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,250
an open-source implementation of the

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,610
radio is also part of this particular

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,560
exercise again we use it as part of the

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,990
OpenStack platform with an SDN control

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,730
using opendaylight and we built a

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,880
complete architecture that actually

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,529
shows both the the ran elements the

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,670
packet core and the edge compute

00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:57,040
elements as part of the overall

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,380
architecture with that architecture as

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,600
our blueprint that to be deployed in a

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,339
virtual central office we now started to

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,700
look at how do we go about actually

00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:09,250
building the overall demo so that brings

00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,209
me to the lab topology in terms of how

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,520
we did it

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:15,970
this time around cumulus was incredible

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,100
in terms of helping us host the entire

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,440
environment in the California lab so

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,870
this is a full data center built with a

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,000
leaf spine fabric with six leaf switches

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,730
two spines which is running cumulus

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,070
software on white box switches and they

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,050
also provided us complete hardware for

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,700
this particular setup what's new and

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,709
interesting here in addition to that

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,320
particular data center fabric and the

00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:42,010
entire setup is a software-defined radio

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,480
and yes nothing would be fun without

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,550
being live so we actually bought a

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,700
Faraday cage and we put some phones

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,350
inside a Faraday cage so now looking at

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,820
the overall topology in terms of how

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,710
this looks like let me just walk you

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,710
through very briefly what you see on the

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,270
top left corner of the screen is the

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,130
Faraday cage with the two phones in

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,900
there and you see that picture right

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,120
underneath that with two phones

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,590
there's actual antennae and then there

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,710
is a software-defined radio that's

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,900
provided by ettus and then you have the

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,060
two bare metal notes the radio unit and

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,560
the distributor unit those two bare

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,500
metal nodes were provisioned by

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,300
OpenStack so OpenStack as a controller

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,190
to actually build and manage those bare

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,810
metal notes and then you have the rest

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,390
of the OpenStack infrastructure hosting

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,060
a whole host of virtual machines those

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,530
virtual machines again not all of the

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,420
virtual machines are depicted here in

00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,830
this picture but the centralized unit

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,810
was actually running as a virtual

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,150
machine on our setup and then you have

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,770
the of course the evolve packet core but

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,970
there's something very interesting in

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,770
the middle there called the session

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,720
director the session director is

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,550
actually redirecting traffic based on

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,650
different phones to different sides of

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,530
the infrastructure one to the corporate

00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,810
VPN and another one to the Internet and

00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,790
what we have for you as part of this

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,500
connectivity is actually a branch office

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,810
that Heather's showing you right here on

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,460
stage and that's a life settlements part

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,350
of the live demo that's connecting back

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,890
to our central office that's in

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:08,110
California and you have now some phone

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,480
clients that are registering everywhere

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,550
from from California back to here now

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,950
you will get that information a little

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,200
bit clearer in a moment as you see this

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,090
particular data flow so data what we'll

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,310
be showing you live is coming from the

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,100
internet over through the packet core

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:27,490
into one of the phones and then out

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,680
through the other phone back here all

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,820
the way down to the branch office and we

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,620
will actually be able to show you

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,720
something here but before we actually

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,340
show you anything I would request you

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,200
one thing if you can all take out your

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,750
phones that's the first time in its

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,190
penis you know session that somebody's

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,960
asking you to take out your mobile phone

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:49,360
tweet with the hashtag ons 2018 if you

00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,890
can do that now that would be great in

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,260
the meantime I'm going to call Hannon to

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,260
actually walk us through the demo Hannon

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,540
so I hope you're tweeting all right so I

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,250
think it's time to switch over to our

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:14,200
demo so what what are we seeing here is

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,930
that I am having a remote Dastak

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,210
connected to the lab back in California

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,920
and what we are seeing here as well is

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,320
the representation of the two phone we

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,560
are actually controlling the phones on

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,560
the cage - the app ok and to show you

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,180
this is working life so I going to

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,180
switch off one of the phone

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,800
well III didn't mention that this back

00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:48,560
in California right so there is some

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,839
like in here so maybe I gonna ask my

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,600
guys Dave can you switch out the phone

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,000
please

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,010
there we are so we should be seeing the

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,440
phone connecting yeah there it is it's

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,470
attached to the network that we have

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,990
live in the lab and the next thing we

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,940
are going to ask is let me see if I can

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,670
get hold today huh

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,470
it's working now so did you guys finish

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:17,750
tweeting because I would like to see

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:22,070
real-time tweet here and actually I

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:31,430
gonna not do it here and I gonna do it

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:36,640
here oh no not here we go I say the

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,640
other ones on our stage today please

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:49,630
there we go come on all right so let's

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,140
refresh that and I hope we are getting

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:56,360
much better result ow all right so we're

00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,529
seeing the tweets update that y'all are

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,950
sending your scene

00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:03,350
this is good so we have done stage it's

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,940
great we have that phone connected to

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,250
the internet and actually what I didn't

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,500
say is that there is two phones on on

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,930
the cage connect to the same network one

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,730
of them is attached to the it's a touch

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,310
the same network sorry connected to the

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,500
Internet the second phone it's as well

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,149
on the same cage but even true is we are

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,250
using the same radio and we're using the

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:24,020
same if you see it's attached to a

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,449
corporate network and that corporate

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,300
network is where that P weeks and that

00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:32,329
central office is touched to so just to

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,829
show you guys that we are live here so I

00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:36,649
gotta play some music of course

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:38,390
this music is playing loud in the cage

00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:41,589
we are not hearing anything is back in

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:45,230
California but as we are doing a mobile

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:48,770
demo let's try to make a call and I call

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,460
back the stage here looks like I got a

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,410
call so

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,920
you're heating something oh I'm hearing

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:59,290
something let's plug it into this okay

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:06,010
let's share with everybody that the

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:09,510
music I love it when my friends call me

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:20,320
with Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:23,080
alright well done I am now forever going

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,380
to refer to that song as islands of

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,600
packets in the mobile data stream all

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,940
right so I just want to make sure that I

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,250
sort of understood so this phone I

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,170
basically just got a phone call from

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,480
your phone back in the cage in

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,940
California absolutely yeah so while we

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,300
were hitting is the music that is this

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,790
phone is a streaming music and playing

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,000
loudly on the on the cage and the second

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:51,430
phone is picking up on the mic what is

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,580
what the first four this is playing and

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,410
back through the voice channel to the

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,540
call here yeah

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,130
all right cool so as I said I would love

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,950
for this to have been something more

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,690
like augmented reality virtual reality

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,560
but it's hard to do that in a cage on

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:11,290
another continent but so as our we've

00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,760
had some pretty graphs going back here

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,959
in the background while those calls are

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,790
happening do you just want to point out

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,440
what was going on there sure Heather so

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,750
while you were actually busy taking that

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,000
call I noticed that that you see that

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,650
such call went through and on this

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,390
particular graph and you see that it was

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,100
active for a few seconds because that's

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,230
when you were listening to the music and

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,840
then when you shut it off it went back

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,580
down again and you can actually see that

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,050
there was some data that went through

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,630
that particular sub session so you

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,220
actually see that live here as as soon

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,600
as the call went up you see the spike

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,240
and then when the pull and the call goes

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,180
down you see the spike goes down the

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,100
other activity that you show you're also

00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,060
seeing here for example on this

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,520
particular screen is the assurance

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,660
capability now the first one was through

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,340
the session director where you're

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,290
actually looking at what's happening in

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,180
the sip sessions now this one you're

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,610
actually monitoring the voice traffic

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,280
and here you can see the KPIs latency

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,930
variation over time and here you can see

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,250
the success or failure rates and you

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,990
actually see how many unique call

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,780
attempts were there why did they fail

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:13,300
they were they successful what was a

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,920
delay average delay and of course the

00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,320
cause what is the error code for that

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,540
particular failure so really what we're

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,160
trying to do is show not only just a

00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,570
call that's going but remember one of

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,940
the requirements that fish are laid out

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,310
was to actually talk about full

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,840
assurance capability end-to-end with all

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,490
of the delay and all the metrics that

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,730
are assigned to this so we were actually

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,590
able to put that in live monitor the

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,340
call show you all the metrics associated

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,640
with that

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:43,360
great thanks Hana and as our and if we

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,270
can't get back to the slides all right

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,310
so just really quickly you know sort of

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,140
pulling this together unsurprisingly the

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,870
first lesson is open source

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,240
collaboration works we had 15

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,580
organizations and 30 volunteers pulling

00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,040
this together and another point is

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,570
increasing maturity so you know point

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,320
being you know we were actually showing

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,720
you know an actual virtual ran and

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,150
software radio with open source software

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,240
we were showing this on commodity

00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:16,510
hardware built on open source platforms

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:20,200
and there's interoperability between the

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,850
hardware and the virtual EPC you know

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,980
certainly that still there's you know

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,600
this did take work and a lot of planning

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,520
around sort of hardware and

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,590
specification you know one of the things

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,110
that we will be looking to do across a

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,900
number of projects like AK I know Oh PMF

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,870
e.l.f networking is to help sort of make

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,190
that process a lot easier to go from you

00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,690
know sort of putting together a proof of

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,750
concept is something that is really

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,850
deployable and repeatable and then

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,210
certainly from a hardware optimization

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:52,390
point of view a fairly beefy hardware

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:55,180
was necessary and we did learn a fair

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,330
amount about you know what things needed

00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,160
to go on bare metal what things didn't

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,990
really need to a lot of detail around

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,050
that's going to be sort of in the white

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,700
paper and then in terms of what we're

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,320
looking for is next steps so first of

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,200
all if you would like a deeper dive and

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,450
to what we did here we do have this demo

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,310
running in the LF networking booth along

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,560
with a number of other great community

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,959
demos showcasing the work that a lot of

00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,940
our projects have been doing

00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:24,489
Hana and Azhar are doing a zero-touch

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,859
provisioning for edge a breakout session

00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,809
during the conference we also one of

00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,749
food showers colleagues from China

00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:34,509
Mobile is hot is hosting an unconference

00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:37,899
on seer and there are also a number of

00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:39,429
different edge and mobile buffs and on

00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:41,769
conferences and sessions happening this

00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:43,779
week check your schedule you can join

00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:46,199
the VCO demo mailing lists if you're

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:48,399
interested in continuing to evolve this

00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:51,219
we've got a number of working groups

00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:53,649
going on in open Fe a seer and group an

00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:55,359
edge group of the rocket project

00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:57,699
specifically is looking at some of that

00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,109
beefier hardware that a lot of folks are

00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:00,789
looking at the edge so we can make sure

00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:03,669
we've got interoperability with the open

00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:05,019
source applications and that we're also

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,849
as I said really looking to

00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:08,559
operationalize what we've learned here

00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,859
so start incorporating these

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,690
capabilities into our CI CD our

00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:15,759
automated testing one thing that we've

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,539
done in the course of this project is we

00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:22,839
now actually have a virtual EPC as one

00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:26,379
of the vnfs that we deploy on various

00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:28,419
OPN efi scenarios as part of our regular

00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:31,419
testing so that we're able to make sure

00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:33,459
as we keep evolving the software stacks

00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:35,619
that these types of applications work

00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,959
and then you know as we mentioned

00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:39,369
obviously there is a cloud native you

00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:41,409
know as our pit and dam we're talking

00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:43,239
about a cloud native vision that we have

00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:47,229
for all of this and there's work going

00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:49,929
on around cloud native activities across

00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:52,419
multiple projects in CN CF and LF not

00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:54,069
working and I encourage folks who are

00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:56,499
interested to get involved in those and

00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:58,269
then finally I think the community

00:21:56,499 --> 00:22:00,249
volunteers who did this whether it was

00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:04,059
providing software-defined radio

00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:05,919
antennas servers racks switches getting

00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,989
this stuff shipped here doing the

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,259
software doing the integration a lot of

00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:14,469
people playing a part here where the

00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:16,569
ecosystem partners involved and helping

00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:18,849
us spec this out helping to find

00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:21,969
requirements and providing those various

00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:25,149
things and then finally this was a

00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:27,009
collaboration across multiple open

00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:29,289
source communities and software from

00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,669
many of them just like to highlight open

00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:32,600
air interface is actually one of the

00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:35,420
newest associate members

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,950
LF networking and they are doing a lot

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,530
of really interesting work they provided

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,840
a lot of great of the sort of next

00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,730
generation mobile pieces for this and we

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,070
look forward to future collaboration

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,050
with them and obviously the hardware

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,870
that's in this Rack is actually a Open

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,400
Compute Project base so it's open source

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,040
hardware with open source software

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,170
running on top of it some of it very

00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,710
generic some of it very telecom 5g

00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:02,330
specific and you know this is what this

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,010
is what I get up in the morning for this

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,960
is what I get very excited about is

00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,210
seeing folks from different projects

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,670
come together to make our ecosystem

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,710
better to make these use cases work and

00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:16,480
to continue to March technology forward

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:18,650
so I would like to ask my wonderful

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,510
co-conspirators and partners in crime to

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,210
come out as I said it takes a lot of

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,760
guts to do a live demo especially one

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,220
that crosses the ocean so thank you all

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,440
for your work and your guts and take a

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:35,990
bow thank you very much thank you thank

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,490
you and so and so thank all of you very

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,070
much for your time and attention today

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,590
and looking forward to a wonderful week

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:47,920
with all of you

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:47,920
