Description: 
	Keynote: The Path To Innovation is Open Source for Telecommunications Service Providers - Thomas Nadeau, Technical Director of NFV, Red Hat

 Disruption is the new normal as telecommunications service providers create the goods and services needed for the digital economy to thrive. Traditional carriers have a new breed of competitor: cloud-scale companies creating digital services and revenue streams, unencumbered by legacy “telco” infrastructure. Open source provides the opportunity to even the playing field.

Red Hat director of NFV engineering Thomas Nadeau will share insights learned from service providers around the world on how to best leverage upstream community innovation, a robust partner ecosystem and integration-ready solutions to transform and reinvigorate digital infrastructure to succeed in this new landscape.

hi good afternoon everybody my name is

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,250
Tom Nadeau I'm from Red Hat today I

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,500
wanted to talk to you briefly I've got

00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,960
rapid five minutes to go through a

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,039
couple of things so what I'd like to

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,380
focus today on is a bit of sort of the

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,080
telco service provider perspective on an

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,060
open source tomorrow we're actually

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,490
doing a tutorial a full length tutorial

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,560
with a lot of the technical details kind

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,070
of surrounding what's driving this for

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,590
us so I'll leave that until tomorrow hmm

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,620
excuse me I apologize I had a sore

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,450
throat all last week so I'm a little

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,070
little coffee here so so I wanted to ask

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,710
this sort of fundamental question about

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,410
you know what is driving communications

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,440
service providers drive for open source

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,760
and open source networking and this

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,140
whole thing and you know this this

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,780
statement I have up on the screen right

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,409
now is basically the you know the sort

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,350
of the driving statement right so csps

00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:09,990
are being driven you know from demand

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,860
for new digital goods and services

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:18,750
you know streaming video streaming audio

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:20,400
mobile 5g use cases and those are what

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,560
are driving us in the open source

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,950
community to develop these sort of these

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,390
solutions with them and then let's talk

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,720
about how those solutions are being

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,880
driven and what it takes to actually

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,270
make those things happen

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:39,360
so you're at an open source conference

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,450
winner Linux Foundation conference so

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,360
community is obviously important in

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,850
these solutions what people forget

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,540
though is that beyond the developer

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,100
community you need larger communities of

00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,240
sort of the support that goes around

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,880
that

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,130
for example OPN a/v is a good example

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,630
where there isn't a whole lot of code

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,759
being developed but there's a very

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,680
important mission and purpose for that

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,160
organization and a lot of that is

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,349
forming an ecosystem as was discussed

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,420
earlier and that also includes other

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:20,100
open source projects in addition to

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:23,100
the one in question and the point of

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,720
that too was that these are all things

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,250
that are wrapped around the technology

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,220
there's a lot of focus at these

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,020
conferences about the technology so it's

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,750
not just about the technology but the

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,660
community and beyond that the the

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,510
ecosystem so I wanted to put up a quick

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,590
example of the projects that we're

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,430
involved in and why they matter in that

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,420
vein you know you'll hear a lot about

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,930
you know you heard about opendaylight

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,150
Opie and Ivy today FDI o brand-new one

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,650
we've just started got involved with

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:01,920
it's called a crane oh that's for edge

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:05,130
type of use cases so these are you know

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,470
these are projects that again not only

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,060
form the technology and the community

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:15,710
but the ecosystem that's built around

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:17,970
that and then to kind of wrap things up

00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,830
one of the one of the points I wanted to

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,790
make too is is that building an

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,700
ecosystem requires a couple of things

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,470
that are important in terms of telco

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,240
transformation telco service provider

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,570
transformation and those are outlined

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,180
here on the slide one is you know

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,220
changing the mindset internally there's

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,959
a cultural change that that often is

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:46,070
required there's a open infrastructure

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,910
and it opened tools sort of

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,800
transformation that has to happen and

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,700
you've seen that at a lot of companies

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:56,430
today AT&T for example is is kind of the

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,010
poster child for this these days you

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,730
know they're out working in projects

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:04,980
building projects for example but then

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,870
you know you if you talk to the the the

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,180
most successful telco service providers

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,400
that are in the space these days you'll

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,430
see that they're actually transforming

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,799
internally to look much like you know

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,070
the sort of canonical example of the

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,310
open source organization say Red Hat for

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,130
example and so you know that goes hand

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,670
in hand with the usual development stuff

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,200
that you all see when you come to these

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,760
Frances and whatnot so there's an

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,240
internal transformation that has to

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,760
happen now and then finally around that

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,210
is basically just an open process and so

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,600
you'll see varying degrees of that in

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,430
any of any telco service provider you

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,070
talk to and those are things that are

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,810
ongoing and they're interesting and and

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,380
important to keep in mind when you're

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,230
engaging with folks both upstream and

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:59,150
downstream and I think that's all the

00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:04,560
time I have so thank you very much

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,560
