Playlist: Open Networking Summit Europe 2018 - Amsterdam
Description: 
	Keynote: #Generation5G Powered by Automation - Emmanuel Lugagne Delpon, Chief Technology Officer, Orange Group Network

Orange started the on-demand journey with first commercial offers and a clear strategy to deploy network cloud infrastructure across the Orange footprint. The road towards network automation in the various Orange affiliates is on-going to offer a better customer experience (less manual errors with full automation).

Orange is very involved in Linux open source communities as a strong believer that open source solutions will be the foundation to deliver full automation required for the unpredictable services to be delivered on 5G networks.

This talk will detail how Orange envision 5G deployment using full automation and how the ecosystem must be organized to achieve such goal (VNF vendors to be aligned with ONAP, ONAP as the foundation for automation, Acumos for machine-learning and AI to be progressively used to handle complex events, more Orange involvement in open source communities..)

good afternoon ladies and gentlemen you

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:09,269
had a wonderful presentation from intel

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:14,670
on 5g and I'm very happy now to share

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:18,150
the view of an operator on 5g I'm going

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:23,850
to share why you believe that automation

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:27,080
and open the interfaces are very key

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,119
ingredients for the success of 5g and

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,880
then I also share why we believe that

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:38,370
the open communities are going to play a

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:43,170
very key role on 5g I'm delighted to

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:46,289
have this oil s summit in Europe taking

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,850
place in Europe for the first time just

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,030
to remind you if I may

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,850
so the GSM technology was invented here

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:59,250
was built here 25 years ago and it was

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:03,989
built in Europe by people who were

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,740
convinced that the old you know analogic

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,260
mobile technology was too fragmented and

00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:14,060
that with fragmentation we would go

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,030
nowhere basically and jointly and

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:21,420
collectively decided to build the global

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,799
you know standard for mobile and the

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,150
very key ingredient for this success was

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,220
to be collective on under technology

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:36,479
sometimes it's quite um you know it's

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,110
interesting to look at the past to try

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,049
to predict the future or to to try to

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,540
build better the future let us try to

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,869
remind what were the key you know what

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:53,149
has made the mobile technology a success

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:57,240
obviously first there was very huge

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:59,070
customer needs obviously then there was

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,729
some kind of the business side some kind

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,340
of virtual cycle virtual cycle because

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,950
there was a perfect matching between the

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,090
needs and the bill and the business

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,710
developments of suppliers equipment

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:20,850
vendor suppliers

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:23,340
of device suppliers of the operators

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,740
obviously and they're all these needs

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,010
were perfectly matching this wasn't

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,440
business sign then on the technical in

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,020
the technology side there was a good

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,500
matching between first there was some

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,980
kind of global stone that one global

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,900
stone that which was very key to reach

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:49,010
the the the scale and from scale you

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:53,520
have obviously economics you know and

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,820
also it was decided to stick on open

00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,570
interfaces very key open interfaces and

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:04,770
from all you know this virtual cycle we

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:07,170
we got the success we we all know I

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:11,820
think it's important to just to remind

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:16,310
what was a such kind of successes and

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:21,020
key success factors just to to keep an

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:26,370
eye on the future so just to be clear

00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:28,740
with 5g we are going to meet others or

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,740
it is going to be another story because

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:36,720
underlying technology and 5g is based on

00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:41,400
Viet realization and the big trend is

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:45,110
pushed by a kind of magic world which is

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,490
called you know this particular is

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:53,010
fragmented sorry basic world is the

00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,650
disaggregation all the technology

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,220
billion 5 5g is based on this

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,610
aggregation and the equation is if this

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,770
magic world means is magic world which

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,750
is going to help us to build some magic

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,170
magic world you know this kind of

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:18,690
Nirvana that we are all waiting for

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:20,340
which is the full potential of 5g if we

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,740
are not careful we did believe that if

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,570
we are not very careful we will not will

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,250
not definitely not have the benefit of

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,000
5g

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,250
let us just remain a bit what what

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,070
happened on an ante on the person who

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:40,710
have a look at the past in the 25 - the

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:45,390
past years we build progressively you

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,250
know the 2g 3G and so on by putting more

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,330
and more services - starting with this

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,600
all switched technology and then pushing

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,110
for the putting some messaging and then

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,680
some some some data then some on

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:05,870
histology we just had the first what we

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,870
called verticals with machine-to-machine

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,650
5g is a huge gap compared to all what we

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,780
have done until now

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:20,210
it's a very very huge gap so we believe

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:23,940
that Phi G is not only a matter of

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:29,810
spectrum efficiency is not only a matter

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:34,230
equation of new radio 5g is definitely

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,450
5g in his divinity and every free is

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,040
going to have to to to have a very huge

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,430
gap compared to all what we have in

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,950
terms of complexity 5g is going to

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,229
introduce a new order of magnitude of

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:49,290
complexity for the functions are going

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:53,370
we are going to I for the technology

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,020
complexity and also for all the services

00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:00,540
and new requirements we are putting on

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:04,380
5g this is fundamentally what why we

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,570
believe that we will need automation why

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,700
just because we went to have we're going

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,729
to have at the same time on the same

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,910
network a full kind of new services

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:18,270
obviously all the odds all the old

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,310
services but also we have machine to

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,790
machine we have all kind of verticals

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,729
with ultra reliable our low latency

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,560
requirements and we are going to handle

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:32,190
that and to manage that in the same

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,710
network in the same you know like a full

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,330
set of independent or almost independent

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,610
networks and this is a kind of

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,750
extraordinary complexity we will have to

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:48,180
deal with

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:51,750
this is the full promise of 5g so let me

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,600
explain a bit how is going to how is

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,830
that going to happen this is not going

00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:10,050
to be for tomorrow and it's not going to

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:12,720
be in one day over I would say that the

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,000
first phase of 5g is going to be in the

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,919
continuity of what we know in 4G so

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,500
first phase of 5g will be obviously

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,570
capacity and will be more is going to

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,930
provide more throughput more speed for

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:30,810
our customers this is I would say a kind

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:33,750
of four plus one technology and this

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:37,080
first phase of 5g is already fully

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,700
standardized as 3gpp it is going to be

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,400
implemented already in the first

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,620
equipment we are a torrent of fully

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,290
committed it deploys is first rate of 5g

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,280
we need this 5g just because we have

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,380
capacity issues and we need to deploy

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,660
wherever we are in Europe because we

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,310
have capacity issues but this is a

00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,120
simple I will say simple phase of 5g

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,110
just to let you know that we are

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,910
currently driving team trials in Europe

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:10,050
you know eight countries in Europe and

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:15,450
we will launch commercially this 5g in

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:18,030
2020 anyhow in Europe then the big issue

00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:23,820
is more the second phase of 5g which is

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:28,710
the true 5g with all core 5g true 5g

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:31,140
means that the core network is 5g it

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,900
means that it's based on vectorized

00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:38,280
technology it is based on you know all

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:46,170
this this real destruction which is the

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:49,470
authorization let me talk about the you

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,320
know about the kind of revolution we are

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,700
facing here because the journey to the

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,750
truth IG is going to be low

00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,150
we are preparing ourselves already it is

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,390
a long terme and to prepare ourselves

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:09,560
for the full five DS phase to 5g based

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:12,360
on theater as architecture we already

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,540
implement virtualized functions on our

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,150
networks so we are we have already some

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,490
few lessons that we can learn from this

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,430
form those first implementations and

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:27,000
there's a few reasons we have is that we

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,890
should definitely deal with the risk

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,930
we're facing

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,970
we are facing some risk antes

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,930
fertilization and if we do not deal

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,850
right there

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,240
if we do not deal well with diseases

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,190
risk we are going to to be out there in

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:51,690
big trouble and all the industry is

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:55,590
going to be in big trouble what we

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:59,220
believe is that we definitely have to be

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:06,510
very cautious when we talk about this we

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:08,820
heard about virtualization 5g5 G is

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:13,590
going to have its full potential

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:17,550
only if and when the full core will be

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:21,410
based on virtualized elements so now the

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:24,350
question we have is this disaggregation

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:28,140
can bring a lot of Patel

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:31,440
it's to the parentals this aggregation

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,860
has a lot of potential and at orange we

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,610
are fully I would say committed in

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,950
leveraging on the benefits of the of the

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,510
virtualization if we do not handle good

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,320
this fertilization and the

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:48,960
disaggregation we are going to be in

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,680
trouble and all the I would say is the

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,230
community is going to be in big trouble

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,380
so what is the issue the issue that we

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,570
all we do observe that today there are

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,800
too many configurations too many

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,690
parameters too many elements set up at

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,760
our

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,690
that are proposed by the ecosystem by

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,320
the vendors for example as an artist you

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:18,650
know see na VI there is no one na VI

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,720
standard there is no one na VI stone at

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,350
one nav introduced on earth there is no

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,080
today one standard for the orchestration

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,950
and there is a consequence of that is

00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:34,400
that all the actors all the operators to

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,590
have to make more integration so there

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,860
are some extra cost to make Integra to -

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:44,150
to integrate the different elements of

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:54,920
the obviously nav infrastructure

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:57,740
so the see the observation is that the

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,470
disaggregation is - the leading to a

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,260
fragmented market and the fragmentation

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,360
is bad for the ecosystem the

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,280
fragmentation but for the operators the

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,550
fragmentation is very bad also for all

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:15,890
therefore for lot of factors so if we do

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,680
not manage as a community you know to

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,260
make us we did 25 years ago to make a

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,200
global standards we will not have the

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:27,010
benefits mm fertilization and we have

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:31,280
some will have some kind of you know the

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:33,140
mess that we we will all know on the IT

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,600
system so we are bringing the IT

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,400
technologies on the network and the idea

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,020
is the idea is not to bring the mess of

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,720
items at Red Rocks the idea is to

00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,400
benefit IT technologies and also to have

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,800
scale effects of the metric you know the

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,339
good as a network is that we always kept

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,589
to one and stuck to one standard so this

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:55,270
is an urgent call for action which we

00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:59,570
have to to try to stick for one standard

00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:02,710
again if we fail collectively to deliver

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:06,350
one standard and to reduce the number of

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:09,680
configuration under YES on the na VI on

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:14,020
registration I've really believe that

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,850
we'll have a kind of industrial disaster

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,190
industrial disaster is one way the other

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:23,300
way we would be that

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:25,160
Actos will arrive some actors will

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,740
arrive there will be some kind of de

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:32,240
facto standardization of this elements

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:36,770
and they will try to or they will bring

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,390
their standards and I do not believe it

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,820
that they do not believe that all the

00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,560
community will benefit from this de

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,160
facto standardization because they will

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,320
they will more clothes I would say the

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,650
standard that opens the standards so now

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,710
what is the solution and how to scale

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:57,050
and to industrialize and how to have the

00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:59,390
full benefit of the 5 GC is a big

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:04,310
question I have the big question we have

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:07,070
and I believe that again we we have to

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,800
work jointing on that project reminds

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:14,450
that orange we do operate on 32

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:17,270
countries we do operate retain market in

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:21,080
32 countries and in 20s or in 28

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:24,200
countries and we have b2b business in

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,540
more than 200 countries and this makes

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,600
us very sensitive on standardization

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,940
because thoughts help us deploys network

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,130
and help us deploy the services of all

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,610
the countries we have if we have no

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:39,950
standardization we have to redo 28 or

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,290
200 times some of the same work so this

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,600
is mixed it makes the very complex so

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,180
this is reason why we are very very

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,640
pushy and very much involved in all kind

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,590
of standardization bodies so we still

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,130
believe that the right place to

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,960
standardize e3 DC for 5g architecture

00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:00,950
and tonight standardize the 5g

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,960
interfaces is a 3gpp now the 3gpp is on

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,680
these functions then the question is how

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:11,330
you implement it on the clouds and this

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:15,890
big move to the cloud again I think see

00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:18,770
to Tony for 5-10 years all the operators

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,980
worldwide are going to put the network

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,940
into Clyde so we have a transformation

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:28,250
to climb to the cloud of more or less

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:32,590
900 operators singing to be long journey

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:35,410
and we believe that

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,900
at least two key building blocks on

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,090
which we should jointly and as a

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,040
community work to have things more

00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:46,540
standardized so the first one again is a

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,430
yes first one is nfv infrastructure we

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:53,230
believe that one of the right place to

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:56,320
do that is Opie NFV again open source

00:15:53,230 --> 00:16:00,580
communities are one of the good places

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,250
to one of the right places to get to do

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,960
this kind of job so again I rely upon

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,690
those communities and we are heavily

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,410
investing in Opie nav I think we are one

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,750
of the first contributory no P n Fe this

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:18,610
is one building but the second building

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:21,220
block is orchestration we will not have

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,520
the full benefit of 5g if we do not have

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:27,220
the right orchestration layer and again

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,529
the telcos cannot afford to be

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:33,490
fragmented the telco community cannot

00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:35,320
afford to have one orchestration which

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,020
is different from one operator to

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,360
operator and to another operator and to

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,130
reduce the integration work this is not

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,940
good you're going to be viable

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:50,410
so I urgently this is again a call for

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:53,140
action we have contact with GSM a we

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:56,170
also have contact obviously with all the

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:59,890
onap community we do firmly believe that

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:03,220
onap is the right Orchestrator for the

00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:06,100
future it is going to help to to

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,819
standardize all kind of API in all side

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:13,300
of the orchestration layer and we urge

00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:16,900
the operator community to joint their

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:22,839
forces in order to to have own app as

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:25,179
the target orchestration so we are

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,209
investing in remote communities in order

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:35,230
to address all kind of software and

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:40,360
hardware aspects this is going to be a

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:43,140
long journey we believe that the open

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,970
communities are the right have the right

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:49,299
place to help us

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,600
reduce the number of configuration to

00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:57,370
help us finding the right and

00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:00,309
appropriate standards and interfaces to

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,960
have the economies of you know the scale

00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:06,010
effects economies of scale that we are

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:10,260
lost with the disaggregation so it is

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,260
the kind of summary of my talk first

00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:17,530
automation and virtualization are very

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,830
key enablers for the 5g success it is

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,320
going to be a very long journey the open

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,630
communities open source communities are

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,640
the right place and we are willing to

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:32,580
continue investing in this open in these

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:38,160
communities to have the appropriate

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:41,110
enablers and we definitely need to have

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:46,720
standardized and FEI standardized or

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:49,900
more standardized yes telco grade yes in

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,130
order to make sure that we get the full

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:57,220
benefit of the virtualization without

00:18:53,130 --> 00:19:01,820
losing the scale effect we had with you

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:08,750
know classical standardization thank you

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,750
