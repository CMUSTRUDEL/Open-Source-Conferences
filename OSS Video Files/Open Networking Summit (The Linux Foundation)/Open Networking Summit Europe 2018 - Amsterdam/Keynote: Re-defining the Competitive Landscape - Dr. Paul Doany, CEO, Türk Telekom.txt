	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,290
good morning to you all how are you I

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:09,740
hope I think we have an interesting mix

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:15,049
of let me say people who are active in

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:20,609
in one of the most challenging parts of

00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:23,519
this over-regulated sector I think I

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,869
have had an interesting experience in

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,340
that I have been working in

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:33,510
telecommunications all my life and by

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:37,309
definition this is a me-too licensed

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,809
regulated zero innovation business

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,120
because the only form of innovation you

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,559
could be doing would have to be in sales

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,090
and marketing and what people call

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,030
products which were not really products

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,329
but the growth of this sector which is

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:55,860
very exciting that I find very exciting

00:00:51,329 --> 00:01:00,530
anyway is the prospect of what

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,699
connectivity can can provide so I had a

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,350
interesting experience in the fact that

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,600
I come from Network engineering as a

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,070
background but the last time I did any

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,290
network engineering was a very very long

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,530
time ago and I got into

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:18,360
telecommunications and I could easily

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:22,740
see that investing in this company which

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,390
is the first thing that I did in in the

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,520
country of Turkey I myself do not come

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,549
from there was the privatisation of a

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,920
fixed line operator that had a very weak

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,990
mobile which was a merge of the third

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,409
and the fourth so here you have a case

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,820
of you have a fixed operator and

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,590
presumably a so-called dying business

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:48,240
which is in decline

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,860
that's 2005 and yet you have people

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,470
telling you that the future is mobile

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,869
and therefore because the future is

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,479
mobile you have to pay a premium to buy

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,939
a mobile so what happened in that

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,549
particular country is that you had two

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,219
major investments got in there one is

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,140
the privatization of 55 percent of the

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,479
fixed operator that had a very weak

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,550
mobile which in the end we said less by

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,710
that fair value we were lucky enough to

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,980
win that

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,350
that auction process and the second one

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,740
was the full ownership of a mobile

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,630
operator which Vodafone were lucky code

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:27,620
and code enough to buy at a very high

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:30,290
premium now if the future is mobile my

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,210
problem with mobile frankly would tell

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,470
you to share with you all of you it's

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:43,940
that even back then I never believed in

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:49,430
a in a service that the access meaning

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:51,860
the air interface cannot be monetized by

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,610
what you give to the customer so that

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,490
was the part that disturbed me

00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,920
technologically with what was known as a

00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,660
mobile service back then whether it was

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,190
2g and then two and a half G and then we

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,800
knew that 3G was coming and all this

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,840
stuff and now 4G and now great now we

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,610
have 5g coming so it wasn't the question

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,740
only that we have in efficient capacity

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,830
driven through a limited bandwidth

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,640
channel my problem was how you can

00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:24,830
monetize that bandwidth for what the

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,680
customer wants which in fixed line is

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,710
very easy because if someone wants a lot

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,680
of bandwidth he pays for a lot of

00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,430
bandwidth if someone wants a lot of

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,810
capacity he pays for a lot of capacity

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:43,760
but if all you can monetize is capacity

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,610
data I'm talking and if you cannot

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,950
monetize the bandwidth now that's that's

00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,270
a very dangerous business model because

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,180
we all know what sales and marketing

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,100
people do they just keep lowering the

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,430
price so that's the only tool they have

00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,320
and they will make very fancy ads and I

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,150
will say I have a better network than

00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,830
the other one just make that mistake and

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,440
say you have a better network than the

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,680
other one and deliver on that which will

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,250
be costly and the problem is that the

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,100
high R per customer is happy to pay you

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:20,720
more if you can give him the bandwidth

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:23,690
that he needs he doesn't want to have a

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,760
poor service he doesn't need the excess

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,660
capacity that you're offering him but he

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,040
wants the bandwidth

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,960
so I figured you know a long time ago

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,520
frankly more than 10 years ago that the

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,710
future is going to be on monetizing

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,560
bandwidth and that was the reason why I

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:43,070
was skeptical about a premium on mobile

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,190
meaning by a mobile at a high premium on

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,970
the other hand I also believed that the

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,830
provision cost effective provision of

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,570
any meaningful amount of bandwidth

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,500
because people's bandwidth requirements

00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:01,460
will increase can only be provided by a

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:04,370
cable a cable access and therefore if

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,980
you have ducts and you have cables you

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,140
are able to access to the customer where

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,280
they need it so for me the future is not

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:15,740
mobile the future is sort of fixed by

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,380
that I don't mean fixed that you can't

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,570
move meaning is in the home or is it's

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,920
in a business what I mean by so-called

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:27,170
fixed is that you as a customer

00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,560
generally need a lot in certain

00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:33,200
locations in those locations the only

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,220
cost-effective provision that can be

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,110
provided to you is by a form and by the

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,780
way some of this stuff can be also

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,120
wirelessly provided so I'm not talking

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,919
about the technology of the provision of

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,530
a fixed service you can very well

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,630
provide it purely with where the

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,750
wireless means at the access point which

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,640
is the edge point or the point of access

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,050
or access to the access point you know

00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,610
which is what people are doing even with

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,380
Wi-Fi so I'm not talking about those

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,290
things but what I'm trying to say is

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,090
that my major difficulty conceptually is

00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,700
that if you're investing money in a

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,370
sector you have to be able to monetize

00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,610
bandwidth okay that was my problem with

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,290
mobile ok the second is that there is no

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,090
future without mobile meaning you have

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,919
to have mobile customers but then at a

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,550
certain point everybody will have a

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,590
mobile phone

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,720
so you've achieved your penetration and

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,190
then now they're telling us that IOT is

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,169
going to be the savior of this sector

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,220
yeah but I mean but who's going to

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:33,440
provide that so I had this privilege of

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,150
exiting the telecom sector 2011 and be

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,320
away from all of this stuff and invest

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,310
more in venture capital type things that

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,760
that I felt were

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,460
building a future away from conventional

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,800
telcos and I was very happy to be doing

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,070
that but unfortunately I was called back

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,240
into the same company because of the

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:59,030
acquisition loan default and what the

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,980
company needed was a transition CEO and

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,410
we're a public company so what I'm

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:07,460
saying is is basically public is that I

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,430
mean we're listed on the Samba Stock

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,400
Exchange is that to take the company now

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,790
from where it is onto its next future

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:21,590
and initially when I came back to the

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:24,680
company obviously I hadn't changed the

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:29,480
way I was thinking but I made four

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,310
acquisitions in 2006 7 & 8 for this

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,530
company which were basically IT

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:37,190
technology companies we managed to

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,720
convince one in particular called our

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,480
gala that's established now and that's

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,070
see a company in the US that we needed

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:49,210
to invest in the next future of

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:53,060
monetizing what we give to the customer

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:55,850
in a form that we should control because

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,350
there was no vendor doing that for us so

00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,930
that was the role of this particular

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,120
company then we also invested in a

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,830
system integration company and then we

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,660
invested also in an education content

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,390
and platform companies there are 2,000

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,920
people working in these companies but

00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,180
these were not inside the telco they

00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,040
were in their own the founders were

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,810
convinced to remain in the company and

00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,550
obviously the only way we could keep

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,500
them there without having any shares is

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,260
that you would monetize your

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,690
contribution and share rather than I

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,460
mean an exit value share is that you got

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,800
a salary and a bonus and realize your

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,390
dream as opposed to build a company and

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,760
sell it because sell codes cannot do

00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,530
that and then we are all have to be

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,300
employees with our own kind of like

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,130
options within this company which is our

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,990
own company what's interesting to me is

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,310
that these guys were working on that and

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,170
they were asking me when they meet me

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,630
what's the e bid of the company next

00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,560
quarter the big telco they start to

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,900
thinking because that's where their

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,660
value is and we build some things the

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,220
the fourth company unfortunately was a

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,960
game company they didn't look after it

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,880
when I left the company I invested

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,070
that and that's now a hundred times the

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,620
value that they lost that particular

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,000
game company so these were things that I

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,910
believed in when I returned to the

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,640
company one thing exciting I found I had

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,030
I had spoken to the nazia guys or the

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,610
our gala guys in 2012 I left in 2011 and

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:16,520
I went to visit the guys and as we were

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:20,240
talking about what they're doing they

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:25,850
told me they are working on Sdn and I

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:28,070
said are you crazy this was 2012 uh-huh

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,350
you're gonna need five seven years to

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,360
get any return on that investment will

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,610
they support you know stuff that I don't

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,110
believe in it but so definitely there's

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,570
a direction there but will the company

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,600
continued because telcos do not invest

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:46,700
in these things telcos by definition are

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,220
cash cow companies most of them get

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,200
nothing by innovation so all they do

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,770
they innovate in the areas that had the

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,750
least value and obviously luckily for

00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,220
them they were able to get an important

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,840
contract relating to a local base

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,970
station requirement and all that so they

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,740
were able to fund it so when I came back

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,270
I want to see what they did and I

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,280
couldn't believe it

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,050
now they're part of the network forum

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,940
that we met on up is an incredible

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,280
opportunity I think for telcos they're

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,640
key in it Nats here guys established a

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,010
US presence and they were telling me

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,870
what they've done on radio slicing radio

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,880
slicing that's exactly what I was

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,740
talking about earlier on when I was

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,140
mentioning to you how you can monetize

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,830
bandwidth I mean yes I mean if you

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,930
that's the way if someone says I want my

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,940
100 megabit per second come what may and

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,820
I'll pay you a premium for that customer

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,710
I don't care I'm gonna pay for capacity

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,870
of course I'll pay you for capacity but

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,340
if you pay me for a bandwidth my friend

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,530
I'll give you any capacity you want

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,540
it's like fixed if you pay me for high

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,840
bandwidth do I calculate how many

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,930
gigabytes you use is unlimited with some

00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,310
level of fair usage obviously right

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:58,100
because it is the bandwidth that has the

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,840
value not the capacity the same thing

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,190
happened with Voice Minutes you got a

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,140
charge minister and package and all of a

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,070
sudden we all knew that voice has no

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,029
future so they they mentioned that they

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:12,439
mentioned the honor probe

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:15,269
they had done proof-of-concept

00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:17,220
installations with Verizon with

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:18,420
Telefonica later with orange so I was

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,549
very impressed what these guys have done

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,160
which also proves that I made the right

00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:25,859
investment on behalf of the company back

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,419
in 2000 67 with these people so that was

00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:28,889
the right move I'm not saying every move

00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:30,839
we did was right but this particular one

00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:33,269
was right obviously we are gonna make

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,299
mistakes along the way but I have to

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:39,149
tell you that when in 2012 I told them

00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:42,449
are you crazy I was even skeptical about

00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:46,319
7 years but I thought maybe 5 and that's

00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:49,619
just 6 years ago so we are now right

00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:52,889
there and telcos I'm also finding are

00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:55,009
starting to wake up so I'm very proud of

00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:57,299
what telcos are now doing as well and

00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:58,949
realizing that we are in a limited

00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,720
vendor world right now because obviously

00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:03,389
the vendors ended up eating each other

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,999
as well so there's an interesting future

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:09,720
coming and one of the things that telcos

00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:12,239
do complain about our regulators for

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,799
example I'd like to say just spend maybe

00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,799
just half a minute on that subject

00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,850
regulators are doing the job that was

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,949
given to them the mistake is in what is

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,669
given to them to execute it's not them

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:30,239
in particular but I think that societies

00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:32,100
speak about now a digital future or

00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:36,169
digital transformation future and who is

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,169
going to provide that cost effectively

00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:42,089
to them to the people so basically the

00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:44,579
public interest part that is the part

00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:46,110
that the competition model that we all

00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:49,529
have to understand where it came from

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:53,039
was get the highest license price you

00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:55,559
can but ensure that there's competition

00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:59,039
so you have multi vendor multi license

00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:01,259
multi network and then ensure there's

00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,669
competition so that the people of the

00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,850
country can enjoy a service at a

00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:08,009
competitive price okay simple enough the

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,379
problem with that model going from where

00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:14,399
we are now to go to where we need to go

00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:18,389
next is that these particular telcos

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,730
cannot sustain the same old model cost

00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:25,540
effectively to go from where we are now

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:29,170
the LTE world to the so-called 5g world

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,139
okay because then duplication of

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:35,079
infrastructure becomes very very costly

00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:38,459
and dangerous also the competition model

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,420
is a little bit complicated so the

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,600
regulator's will have a very difficult

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:48,180
job to do the other thing that telcos

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:51,430
complain about our ot T's you know I

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:55,050
don't share that view because if it were

00:13:51,430 --> 00:14:01,510
not for what so-called ot T's have done

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:03,459
to create demand for traffic and I'm not

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:07,120
talking about bandwidth now this is more

00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:10,120
con some consumption type traffic which

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,290
is perfect for a telco is all of these

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,810
oddities now to complain about ot T's

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,019
who are the ones that took a risk made

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,880
investments provided a free service

00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,100
didn't charge for it found a way of

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,410
monetizing it fine ethical or unethical

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,139
that's not a telco problem I'm not

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,440
praising the old titties okay ah but I

00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,990
know

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,870
on what grounds I can complain about

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,060
them but not as a telco not as a telco

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,860
you can complain about them because of

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,329
their wrong behavior and not respecting

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,100
customer privacy and so on that's

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:44,500
another subject that's a legal issue

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,680
okay and for that they deserve to be

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,980
blamed but for a telco to claim that

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,980
someone is providing a free service that

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,290
customers are happy to use and you are

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,120
having to monetize it then think what it

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,630
is that you are monetizing you are

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,329
monetizing capacity these oddities don't

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,630
generate that much capacity my friends

00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:09,399
and they don't need that much bandwidth

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:12,940
but your customers of the future are

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,339
gonna need that quality of access which

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,899
means they're gonna need the bandwidth

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:20,410
okay they are going to need the latency

00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:22,630
limits and that is where if people have

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:27,250
a skill they should be able to provide

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:29,680
that service over a limited bandwidth

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,910
device let's say up to a hundred Meg I'm

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,410
not talking about the one bigger and

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,390
very complicated things but even I'm

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,620
talking about mobile devices that are

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,290
still 4G

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,570
and if you do radio slicing with small

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,400
cell you can do a lot that you can

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,040
monetize from the customer in what I

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,420
said so-called fix you give your

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,480
customer something that he really wants

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,910
and then don't tell him what he's

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,510
allowed or not allowed to do with that

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:58,180
bandwidth if an OTT now smartly comes

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:01,630
and comes up with an amazing future

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:04,350
health solution that is bandwidth hungry

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,820
don't them complain that you are now

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,620
having to bear the cost of that because

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,340
now your customer will be paying for it

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:14,170
otherwise be creative and build that

00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,020
future instead of just complaining about

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,990
this hidden enemy and then they create

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:23,320
all this in my opinion nonsense about

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,600
things like net neutrality that they

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,880
believe that net neutrality is something

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,190
which is against the interests of terror

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,310
of telecom companies that I believe that

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,770
the role of telecom companies should not

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,720
be the ones that complain they should be

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,930
the ones that find a solution for their

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,420
problem and the people who are using

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,500
their bandwidth just you need to know

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,060
who's gonna pay for it

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,220
if the customer is paying for that

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,830
bandwidth if that's the model so be it

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,930
if an OTT wants to buy bandwidth from

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,760
you I think that's also can be a model

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,550
by the way because ot T's try to invest

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,580
in an access and they realize that

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:03,670
there's no future and that so this new

00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:07,090
technology excites me a lot in fact that

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,640
I can tell you in 2012 when I visited

00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:11,020
the office of the nazia guys who were

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,700
creating all of these things and they

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,530
were the R&D arm of the company so they

00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,470
were always doing things that can be

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:20,110
monetized let's say three years ahead

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,700
let's say but you know as the end scared

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,260
me because I said can take a long time

00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,240
it's just that can you survive that

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,430
length of time will the company keep

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,680
feeding the money you need to develop it

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,030
and luckily for us first of all they

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,730
managed to sustain themselves and

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,080
secondly the market also realization

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,720
happened and they proved themselves to

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,120
third-party operators and I am very open

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,720
now to the idea of partnering because

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,960
telcos cannot do these things themselves

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,390
this part really does excite me in the

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,310
sense of what I see other telcos now

00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,530
beginning to do I think AT&T and Verizon

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:57,610
have recently announced for example

00:17:53,530 --> 00:18:00,490
their first so-called 5g direction and

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,610
we've seen what that is I mean that's

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,200
fixed what I called fixed and they're

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,250
right they're absolutely right they're

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,140
doing it the right way and of course

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,930
that's suited to their their particular

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,470
market the future of devices is also

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:18,520
worth spending a couple of minutes on

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:23,170
because you know devices have also been

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:29,310
I mean just imagine that today a person

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:33,640
on a very low ARPU is using a 50 to $100

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:36,670
smartphone that does way beyond what

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,490
this person needs and within his

00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,980
affordability he can do a lot now

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,750
this particular customer think about it

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,260
how much bandwidth with that customer

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,100
need do they need a lot of bandwidth I

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,790
don't think so right

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,040
but he needs capacity that's amazing now

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,800
we know what happened to voice and

00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,470
monetizing voice by minutes which is

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,960
also capacity because voice doesn't need

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:07,090
much bandwidth and that's the part that

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:10,810
I think should help people plan their

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:16,270
future of monetization on their wireless

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:18,750
access network clearly the future is

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:22,470
Mobile in relation to how customers

00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,730
perceive the service but the form of

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,370
connectivity and selling that bandwidth

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,940
will be a mix of different types of

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,800
technologies that open opportunities for

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,990
telcos and people who partner with them

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,840
and even people who will be able to

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:42,460
monetize help them monetize onto this

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:45,550
type of access so while I thought in

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,140
2010 when I when I was doing my last

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,360
business plan and I left the telecom

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,460
sector I can tell you that I presented

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,420
to the board establishment of a new

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,460
digital plan which required exactly six

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,070
hundred million dollars three hundred

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,420
million were coming from a partner 200

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,610
million this was going to be a new

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,440
company 20 many were coming from

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,810
the company I worked for that I was a

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,220
CEO of which had that stake in Turkish

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:13,750
Telecom and her telecom we're gonna be

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:16,480
taking contributing 100 and of this plan

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,510
I don't know what would have happened

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,330
had we done it actually but I remember

00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:25,180
looking at my board and seeing that they

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,790
were scared to say yes because of the

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:31,420
money but they were also scared to say

00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:34,750
no because in my previous working for

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:37,750
them I got every cycle right and then I

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,300
realized that my best option is just to

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,970
get the hell out of that sector totally

00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:46,180
and do something else now that I'm not I

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,640
am back into it I have to say that you

00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,920
know one part of it excites me I have to

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,170
say because it's exciting to try to fix

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,080
something but the other one is to see

00:20:53,170 --> 00:21:00,160
that finally we're going to be able to

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,720
monetize bandwidth and service quality

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,640
but in the end I spend within latency

00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,260
but in the end bandwidth is the key over

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,630
a wireless access forum that is what

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:15,689
excites me thank you very much

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,689
