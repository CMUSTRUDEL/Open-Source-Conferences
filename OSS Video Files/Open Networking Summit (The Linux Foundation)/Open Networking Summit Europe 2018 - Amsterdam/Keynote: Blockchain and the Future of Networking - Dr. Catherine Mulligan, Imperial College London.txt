Description: 
	Keynote: Blockchain and the Future of Networking - Dr. Catherine Mulligan, Visiting Research Fellow, Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering, Imperial College London

 Blockchain is often touted as a transformational technology set to redefine how many businesses work today, but will it have any effect on the networking world?  This talk covers the role that blockchain will play within the networking industries from two perspectives – industry and research.  Firstly, it outlines the work I am leading at UCL called “DataNet” – a project that aims to create a global data infrastructure that does for data what the Internet did for communication.  Through developing a unified set of protocols that cover Identity, privacy, security, trust, sharing and permissioned access to data sets,  we are creating the “data rails” for the digital economy – unlocking the value of digtalisation for individuals, companies and governments.  Secondly, it discusses some nearer term projects that are being done in collaboration with network operators - illustrating the near-term impacts of blockchain that is challenging the established norms of how networks are built and operated.

hi everyone so it's great to be here

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,550
just two quick questions the audience

00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:14,130
who hears heard of Bitcoin who's heard

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:16,170
of blockchain who's bought Bitcoin why

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,690
haven't you retired yet okay sorry it's

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,430
my favorite questions for everybody yeah

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,320
just a warning as well it's actually an

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,849
Australian accent so my apology is if

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,609
you're hoping for a British one so as

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,460
always with universities I must tell you

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,100
who my partners in crime are the idea of

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,890
Datanet was actually originated through

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,450
something called the Gov tech labs at

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:44,520
UCL and the CEO of that is Zeynep and

00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,770
professor Phillips xi is a very well

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,629
known computer scientist and here's the

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,350
sort of architect of these kind of ideas

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:55,710
and we're driving his his plan forward

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,690
so why care about blockchain so for me

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,280
blockchain is as disruptive to the

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,129
telecommunications industry as the

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,870
iPhone was so a little bit of personal

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,180
history about me I worked for over 15

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,409
years in telecommunications and when I

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,909
was a lot younger than I am today I

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,470
spent a lot of time trying to convince

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,450
my leadership in the company I was

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,979
working out that the iPhone was actually

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,049
going to decimate the service layer of

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,299
the industry unfortunately I was proved

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,710
right and unfortunately they didn't

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,450
really listen so I think blockchain

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,400
actually can also have just as big an

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,960
impact if we ignore it in the

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,119
telecommunications industry and don't

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,009
think take it seriously it can also

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,320
actually reduce the costs of core

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,930
networking infrastructure in quite

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,119
surprising ways and so today I'm going

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,460
to give two different examples one is

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,810
the very long-term perspective of what

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,659
we're doing in the research institutions

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,970
and the second one is the second part of

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,710
the presentation it's a little bit more

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,119
about what we're doing closer to term

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,740
with a couple of operators so basically

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,750
for me blockchain is a fundamental

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,939
transformation of how our customers are

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,770
going to behave and how we are also

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:07,770
going to be able to create new revenue

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,479
streams so what is a blockchain it's a

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,580
it's an interesting question and it's a

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,210
one that actually you will get a lot of

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,450
different answers to and I depended

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,670
who you ask but basically for me a

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,590
blockchain allows untrusting parties to

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,780
co-create a historical transactional

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,330
record without relying on a central

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,740
authority the other thing to note is

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,320
that blockchain and distributed ledger

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,850
are often used interchangeably for me

00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,770
they're not exactly the same thing but

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm an academic so I'm a little bit anal

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:39,160
about these kind of things so blockchain

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,740
however is a lot bigger than Bitcoin

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,020
when we talk about blockchain in a

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,390
variety of just different fora we often

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,460
seem to have this you know this idea

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:55,600
that it's about crypto currencies only

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:58,000
and in 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,610
the paper on Bitcoin and what that did

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,650
was release two things one was the idea

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,330
of crypto currencies and the other was

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,610
the idea of this this concept of a

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,410
blockchain and if we think about a

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,900
distributed ledger is merely just a

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,790
platform upon which various applications

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,400
can be built and that goes far beyond

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,110
financial services so here we have the

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,910
blockchain as a platform at the bottom

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,550
we have a bunch of different types of

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,430
Records currency assets contracts data

00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,010
and peer-to-peer and we can see that

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,950
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are really

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:33,580
only on the - on the far right hand side

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,280
here it touches on supply chains digital

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,890
rights management insurance financial

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,610
securities everything really could be

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,200
affected by blockchain however be very

00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,730
careful because it might not say it

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,020
might take a lot longer than everyone is

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,150
telling you we have a lot of people

00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,190
coming into offices saying that we're

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,370
going to redefine the future of I don't

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,770
know transport without new token and

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,330
quite often you know at the end of the

00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,850
day those solutions are really quite

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:05,650
small in comparison to the size of the

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:08,050
problem of transport so what do we mean

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,590
by a central authority if we think about

00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:14,500
today's world we have the bank we have

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,590
lawyers we have real estate agents and

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,989
we have the firm the idea here is our

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,270
society for the last sort of hundred odd

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:25,690
years has been defined by intermediaries

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,220
it's been defined by a set of social

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,920
norms whereby we out

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,140
source trust to a third party in order

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,240
for our system to work so for example

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,190
Bitcoin the idea was that we would

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,770
replace the central bank every

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,140
individual is able to create their own

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,670
or sorry use their own currency store it

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,680
and exchange it with each other and

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,020
appear to appear fashion without needed

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,960
in about a bank to create the trust so

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,910
if you think about the British pound or

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,100
the euro

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,870
if you look on on the British Pound it

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,880
says the Bank of England and that is the

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,850
institution that has provided trust in

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,220
that currency for however long it has

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,250
existed and the idea with Bitcoin is you

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,970
no longer need that other areas however

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,400
are for example law we have a huge

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,160
number of lawyers or legal firms coming

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,450
into the centre and basically saying you

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,700
know we've got a big problem here

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,890
because blockchain means that we can

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,320
have things called smart contracts so we

00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:26,710
can move our business model from a per

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,180
hour basis to a per piece basis which of

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,630
course scares a lot of lawyers because

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,160
it's going to make them a lot poorer

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,169
basically I'm not so sure I'm worried

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,800
about that but you know if you think

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:40,390
about a law firm the contracts between

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,160
companies are set up by legal firms and

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,440
if you can remove a lot of that work

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,570
using a blockchain by a shared

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,220
transactional record well actually that

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,640
does have a big impact on the way that

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:54,760
you would establish contracts the one of

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,490
my colleagues from Imperial College was

00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,580
extremely interested in trying to put

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,800
blockchain sorry put title deeds of

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,419
houses onto the blockchain mainly

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,900
because he'd ended up in a dispute about

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:10,510
who owned his house so he would like to

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,640
put all of the title deeds of you know

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,200
your house onto the blockchain and the

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,910
idea of course is there you remove the

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,640
intermediary of the real estate agent

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,310
you're able to do things like do title

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,700
deed search is much more quickly and the

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:28,870
final one is the the firm itself so

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,370
corporations have you know will have the

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,220
boundaries of the firm sort of quite

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,370
dramatically reduced but that's a lot

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,620
more in satiric so very simply if we

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,169
think about it today is transactions we

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,300
have separate Ledger's any

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,580
institution with no oversight there's a

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,499
high risk for human error and fraud we

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,900
have paper driven processes that create

00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:51,210
delays and errors and a dependence on

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,219
intermediaries to ensure trust which

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,300
increases transaction costs and time

00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:59,759
delays so an example of this that was we

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,590
saw previously released earlier this

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:07,560
year was a print of concept released by

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:13,729
pccw global and cult where they looked

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:16,680
at their remittances based on voice

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:18,449
voice traffic and implemented a

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,449
blockchain solution in order to remove

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:24,870
the heavy burden of paper driven

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:27,210
processes in that and they proved well

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,060
they didn't prove it but they estimated

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:33,029
that they save over 1,600 man-hours a

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,039
year just by doing their transactions

00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:39,210
using a blockchain so the previous

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,249
previous generations of digital

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,949
technology have really been about data

00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:47,129
and information so IOT is about you know

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,930
getting more data more information and

00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:50,669
basically about how to exchange it

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,620
faster and more securely in pretty much

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:54,270
the same way that we've been doing it

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,129
before but with the same sort of

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,129
boundaries of the firm the idea has been

00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:02,129
apply a tea to do the same business

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:04,139
processes just faster tomorrow's

00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,089
transactions the idea is you would use a

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:10,229
shared single ledger between different

00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:12,180
companies records are added so it can't

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:15,060
be added without every single party

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,550
agreeing to those transactions being

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,499
added and the records can't be changed

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,770
so that's one of the fundamental pieces

00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,879
of the blockchain you can't change a

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,610
record without all of the parties

00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,169
agreeing to it there's a reduction in

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,190
paper based systems and a reduced

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:35,069
potential for fraud so the idea is apply

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,260
the IT to completely redefine business

00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:40,019
processes what does that actually mean

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,750
in practice if anyone wants to actually

00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,099
build a blockchain or has done so has

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,829
anyone actually tried to build some

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,779
blockchain solutions has anyone actually

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:51,240
tried that

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,230
no Wow okay so you've read about

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,880
blockchain but you haven't actually

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,610
tried anything

00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:01,290
fair enough okay I'm about to blow your

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:02,699
mind and a bit then okay so what happens

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,259
is so for example it's completely

00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,819
outside of telecommunications if you

00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,009
look at the insurance industry we did a

00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:09,990
proof of concept for them looking at how

00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:12,889
you could use blockchain to reduce fraud

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,290
and reduce paper-based processes and

00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:18,269
what happened there was the first thing

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,040
you had to do was get every single

00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,209
company in a room and every single

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,970
company had to bring their lawyer

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:26,370
because they were sharing business data

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,740
between one another in a way that had

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,089
never been done before so this is what

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,880
we mean about the boundaries of the firm

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:34,440
exchanging companies share data that

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,259
they have never shared with one another

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,339
before the other thing that had to

00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,720
happen which may be interesting

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,790
depending on how the telecommunication

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,290
industry progresses is that the

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,990
regulator had to be in the room

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,720
because obviously insurance is a very

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,819
sensitive topic and they had to make

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,459
sure that there was no antitrust issues

00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:58,500
so redefining the boundary of the firm

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,810
sharing information between different

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,269
corporations gives you potentially anti

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,430
antitrust problems so they wanted to

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,470
make sure what data was being shared

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,209
there was no pricing information and

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,009
then it wasn't detrimental to the

00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:14,250
end-user consumer just something to

00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:18,839
think about so lots of different types

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:21,360
of distributed ledger so there is one

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,120
thing to to really be aware of when

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,829
people coming in to sell it sell things

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,899
to you there's more than one different

00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:29,970
type of distributed ledger as an

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,000
institute we we aren't you know bound to

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,339
any particular type there is just a

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,439
spectrum of them we have for example

00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,569
here blockchain which is what most

00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,850
people in public referred to as

00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:43,910
blockchain which is Bitcoin and

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,980
aetherium so they are public

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,899
permissionless and shared systems so

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,800
what does that mean if everybody in this

00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,660
room is a network node for Bitcoin so

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,009
pretend you're a computer for a second

00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:02,040
every single one of you had records

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,689
every single transaction so if I want to

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,760
give ten pounds to the person sitting

00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:08,130
just here every single one of you

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,480
records that I'm well ten Bitcoin

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm very generous I'm gonna give you ten

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,050
Bitcoin every single person in the room

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,370
would record that transaction what that

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,770
also means is anyone can read the

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,320
transactions and anyone can join the

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,660
network and there are no boundaries on

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,520
that in order to ensure that you have to

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,770
have quite a lot of complex mathematics

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,840
at the bottom which I haven't gone into

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,730
today but if anyone would like to

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,880
discuss proof of work come and see me

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,650
afterwards but you also have other types

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,360
which are permission private shared

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:43,530
systems and that's a lot more about

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,380
enterprise types of blockchain so as was

00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,060
mentioned we have hyper ledger and that

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,090
means you have to be whitelisted to get

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,280
access to the system whitelisted to read

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,110
and write and you have to have

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,410
permission to read the transactions as

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,060
well so you you know and then there are

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,590
hybrid systems which allow you to do a

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,880
bit of both so in the final few minutes

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,610
I was just going to talk to you about

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:13,020
blockchain and networking and this is a

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:15,810
very long term view we've started a

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,090
program at UCL called data net which is

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:21,480
looking at how we would reform or

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:26,130
recreate certain aspects of digital

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,940
technologies for the data world if you

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,670
will so the idea is that with regards to

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,950
data we're really at the same stage of

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,570
the internet oh sorry we're really at

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,760
the same stage of development as we were

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,580
in the early days of the internet and

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:45,480
the idea is that blockchain can address

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,860
some of these issues so data if you

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,450
think about it is having a pretty

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,150
dramatic impact on national and

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,010
international seats of power this is a

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,420
very complex slide I'm not going to go

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,130
into great detail but this is some of

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,190
the political economy behind what we're

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,200
doing data is transforming governments

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,450
it's transforming financial institutions

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,560
it's transforming industry it's

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,790
transforming even research so and we

00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,940
have this idea of a double-edged sword

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,520
so my personal data is quite often being

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,550
used in ways that I probably wouldn't

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,460
agree with or wouldn't like by very

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,410
large companies and

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,030
financial institutions are being funds

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,860
mentally-challenged and governments are

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,750
struggling with potential manipulation

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,190
of information sources that's the

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,020
political context of what we're looking

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,180
at this is the digital of their the

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,300
architecture of what we're looking at

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,250
and the idea is how do we give people

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,840
access to the data they are in data in

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,090
the same way that we give them access to

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,450
the Internet but give them control over

00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:50,310
it

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:52,610
rather than solely relying on corporate

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,660
entities to take care of it for them

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,750
so we have a couple of different layers

00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,060
here firstly the idea of a data vault or

00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,460
data banking this is quite a common idea

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,920
actually in the blockchain space whereby

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,050
I would have my data all of my personal

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,140
data is owned by me and I give people

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:13,950
permission to use it so you can pay me

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,900
for access to my personal data we then

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,240
have this idea of an infrastructure

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,160
layer a blockchain enabled

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,550
infrastructure layer where we're looking

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,890
at Identity Management personal data for

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,170
companies and clients as well so it's

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,870
the access layer that we're very much

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,990
looking at building and the idea is on

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,370
top of that we have this idea of a

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,640
universal services layer obviously

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,080
security is a unavoidable issue that we

00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,320
we will deal with but I'm leaving that

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,440
to the side for the moment the universal

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:51,840
say services layer allows us to build a

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,670
new form of new industries on top some

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,740
of these are the data banking sectors so

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,980
this idea of buying and selling personal

00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,430
data the other one is e services so law

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:05,550
for example would be able to completely

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,040
be redefined how they deliver legal

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,610
services government sector and research

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,980
sector

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,040
the idea is you could think of this as

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,410
akin to a sovereign wealth fund but it's

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,930
a data wealth fund so we're completely

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,050
redefining how our society and our

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,980
economy would function based around data

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,390
so like I said this is a very

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:31,020
forward-thinking piece of work so how

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:34,230
are we going to do this we have the idea

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:37,500
of a data net which basically give

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,260
Eydie identity privacy trust using a

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,120
form of a universal data locator which

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,030
provides extensible addressing to all

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,550
private data and as i said the idea is

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,620
we're going to create new industry

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,070
sectors we then are going to build

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,480
universal data infrastructures and the

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,040
idea obviously we build on top of the

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,930
existing Internet's but we're going to

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,800
have addressing security and previous

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,910
permissioned access and then some

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,220
dynamic trust rating systems and this is

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,110
the technology stack so far and the

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,300
protocols so we're working with a number

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,160
of other universities and if anyone else

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,750
would like more information you know

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,540
you're very welcome to to call me

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,970
afterwards talk to me afterwards but

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,470
let's look at a near-term view now and

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,410
this is some work that I've been doing

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,870
with Colt the wholesale

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,730
telecommunications provider and they've

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,240
done quite a little quite a bit of work

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:36,720
around looking at blockchain for

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,300
remittances we've also been looking at

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,310
using blockchain together with Sdn C and

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,900
this is actually going to be released I

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:49,470
believe it MF in November the idea is

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:52,980
you know how do you in a world well in a

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,720
world where the internet or the

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,270
telecommunications providers have moved

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,030
Sdn we have an issue associated with the

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,220
Sdn controllers mainly that there is

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,350
going to be a lot more of them than we

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,920
previously had and negotiating the

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:10,380
contracts associated with the St ins or

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,150
Sdn interconnects are going to be a lot

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,250
more complicated and they'll have to be

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,000
done dynamically because we just can't

00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,280
as an industry

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,440
afford to have everybody go out and

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,600
negotiate sign contracts as we do today

00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,829
so very much today this is all done

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,560
manually it's a great job by the way you

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:32,130
basically start in Hawaii and you move

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,050
around all the really nice locations

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,010
across the world negotiating contracts

00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,640
so I guess there's going to be a little

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,320
bit of pushback on that but but it will

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,210
save the companies a lot of money

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,450
the other one that we've been looking at

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,250
is blockchain as an Orchestrator I know

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,700
that's quite a dangerous thing to say in

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,409
a roomful

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,769
people who were looking at onap and

00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:54,600
similar things but we've been looking at

00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:57,269
this is you know how do you use a

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,029
private permissioned ledger in order to

00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:02,720
potentially monitor networks and

00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:05,279
automate automate that connectivity and

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,580
automates the some of the signaling and

00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,130
reduce some of the network complexity

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:13,440
and that's pretty much what we see here

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,440
effectively we have a smart contract

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,779
enabled DLT with policy fulfillment

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,000
control and usage and we're using the

00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:24,149
event triggers on hyper ledger for

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,250
example to see if we can actually use

00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:30,720
that instead of going with a large-scale

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:34,169
Orchestrator results are mixed I'll be

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,000
honest right now so and this is very

00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:39,059
much a piece of research that that we've

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,220
been looking at the other one that seems

00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,710
to be getting a lot more interest as

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,799
well is this idea of blockchain and some

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,440
of the mobile edge cloud applications so

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,450
you can think of a situation where you

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,730
may want to do a transaction on the edge

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,289
and it will take too much time

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,330
potentially to record that transaction

00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,130
and the financial aspects of that

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,950
transaction back to the centralized

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,470
cloud so the idea is we use some of the

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,630
offline aspects of blockchain we record

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,409
it likely on the edge as it happens and

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:12,210
then we basically at another point sync

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:16,260
back to the centralized servers and the

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,730
centralized OSS BSS systems basically in

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,559
order to provide your records that

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,700
prevents you know contention over

00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,350
billing that was really that simple so

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,480
the idea there is that it reduces

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,580
complexity and delivers quite a bit more

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,980
flexibility across across the network

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:36,690
and that one seems to be working

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:40,289
relatively well the final one that I

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,730
will talk about is data supply chains so

00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,740
as we move to a data world we are

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,630
looking very much at something that we

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,850
refer to in in the academic world as

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,769
data supply chains so you know what a

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,899
physical supply chain looks like we have

00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,789
coffee beans they become a cup of coffee

00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:56,700
but through that process you have

00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:58,830
approximately 144,000 people across the

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,620
world who touch your coffee actually

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,480
before you receive it fascinating

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,370
physical supply chain but what we're

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,300
seeing now is the evolution towards data

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,520
supply chains

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,620
so that's touches again on the private

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,450
data the data that I produce gets

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,190
processed and transformed into a new

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,610
product or that it's sold by somebody

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,110
else

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,210
currently other people are making the

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:22,530
money I might like to make some money of

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:24,450
that myself the issue however is that

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:28,290
data supply chains give us quite a few

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:31,470
problems we have issues here around data

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:34,440
quality data heterogeneity and David a

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,410
privacy and security a big issue could

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,260
be for example in some networks how do I

00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,540
prove that this data is from the person

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,010
that it says it is from how do I prove

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,530
it's from the system that it said it's

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,420
from how do I prove that that sensor

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,300
that has sent that piece of data has not

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:55,590
been tampered with really very complex

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:59,850
difficult problems to solve and one of

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:03,210
these was actually related to data

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:06,420
integrity and energy networks this such

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,130
they came out of a friend of mine who I

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,800
studied sustainable development with

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:13,320
calling me and saying my windmills been

00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,550
hacked my wind turbines been hacked and

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,010
I was like that's great but why have you

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:19,980
called me and they said basically what

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,990
happened was that they had noticed one

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,470
of their wind turbines in the ocean was

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,750
malfunctioning they sent their boat out

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,510
sent it and the person when they got

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,429
there realized that their firmware was

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,470
in another language they didn't know

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:36,390
when it had happened they didn't know

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,550
what that software was doing and they

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,610
didn't know what impact it had on their

00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:44,460
network and obviously that could be

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,440
quite problematic in different types of

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,170
networks and you know energy in

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,030
particular so we went together with the

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,610
company it's an Estonian company called

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,770
guard time and we looked at how you

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:59,100
would create a blockchain enabled data

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:03,240
integrity solution so the idea was that

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:05,130
we used hashes of the firmware we

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,110
registered those onto the blockchain and

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,910
every so often you poll

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,160
basically to make sure that that

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,960
firmware has remained the same if the

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,550
hash has changed something has changed

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,830
on the firmware right

00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,200
so therefore

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:22,340
you then put into operation your other

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,080
normal security procedures what I should

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,630
say here is it doesn't provide security

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,309
it provides an early warning system so

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,870
it tells you something's gone wrong but

00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:32,750
it doesn't fix the problem for you

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,029
so a lot of people say blockchain it's

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,190
more secure or you know is a secure

00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:39,440
solution I fundamentally disagree with

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,450
that book chain is as secure as any

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,360
other solution and you need to apply all

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:49,730
of your security around it as you would

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:56,600
in any other situation and so yeah thank

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:58,309
you and if anyone can you that was very

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,600
fascinating I have a couple of questions

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:04,549
that I'm assuming you have a lot of

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,850
bitcoins and you're gonna pay for the

00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,500
next conference well no actually I'm one

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,860
of the very few academics who has not

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,419
invested okay because I think it I have

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,980
a would have a conflict of interest I'm

00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:17,360
just kidding so the point here is this

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,460
is all enterprise there are a couple of

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,350
people here who obviously can funds your

00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:27,440
next conference they I've got the names

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:29,120
of the people know so my point being you

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,720
know this is enterprise blockchain yeah

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,720
nothing to do with cryptocurrency from a

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,260
timing perspective for for the telecom

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,899
market right we've started seeing you

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,000
know the usual hype cycle of hey the

00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:47,149
blockchain is critical and things like

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,639
that you know as we deploy Sdn and NFV

00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:52,779
and vnfs and CNF sand I mean there's a

00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:56,210
journey here right what is your

00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:58,250
expectation that you know the operators

00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:01,010
should you know operators and vendors

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,529
right what's the timing expectations

00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,450
roughly in terms of when you see this I

00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:07,460
would say becoming mainstream but at

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,360
least getting to a point where you know

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,950
parks can happen in an isolated instance

00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,690
yeah I think we're we've already seen

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,510
two or three pox happen in the

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:21,440
telecommunication space my question will

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:23,779
be when to those scale up okay so we've

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,730
seen the one between PCCW global and

00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,210
cult and actually that's been expanded

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:31,580
now to four other operators

00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:35,320
I think that could be you know a very

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,940
interesting initiative to watch as for

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,130
so enterprise blockchain I think is

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,899
starting to stabilize I think once now

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,450
we're moving into newer versions of

00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:46,760
hyper ledger Sawtooth and fabric fabric

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,289
they're becoming a lot more stable and

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,539
the one key thing that I think is

00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:52,610
important for blockchain is this idea of

00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:53,899
interoperability between blockchain so

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,220
everyone here will understand the

00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:57,590
importance of interoperability and

00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,799
standards and we're seeing a lot more

00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,600
now that there is ability for example to

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,830
build an hyper ledger but integrate

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,020
towards etherium sort of situations yeah

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,230
as for crypto currencies I always

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:14,480
caution people and and warn people that

00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,520
the biggest problem is not necessarily

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,260
the technology the biggest problem is

00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,149
understand the economic incentives

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,659
behind how you would build a crypto

00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:27,020
currency so I'm both a computer

00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:28,580
scientist and an economist so I work

00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,710
with both areas and quite often you will

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,020
see people of design solutions where the

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,120
market tends to zero something that I

00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,799
would caution the telecommunications

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,000
market quite strongly about because of

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,390
the way that you are structured and

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,029
regulated so on the economic part if you

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,460
were to say the number one reason why

00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,620
someone would do block I mean we can do

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,140
everything without blockchain

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,909
technically but the number one or two

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,070
reason why we would do it is it lower

00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:58,279
cost is it better accuracy is it

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,820
simplified up X is it like what is the

00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:03,140
what is the real driver beyond the fact

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,149
that it's it's pretty cool

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,000
yeah beyond the fact that it's cool you

00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:10,909
know I would suggest that it is reduced

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,919
complexity giving cost savings and then

00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,289
ok probably in the next five to ten

00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,179
years increased revenue but I see that

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:19,610
as a longer term perspective ok so yeah

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,080
it does simplify the operations and you

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,070
know you do because you don't know ok

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,960
very good that's nice

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,149
saying yep no I think it's very

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,340
insightful very good thank you very much

00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:32,250
thank you

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,250
