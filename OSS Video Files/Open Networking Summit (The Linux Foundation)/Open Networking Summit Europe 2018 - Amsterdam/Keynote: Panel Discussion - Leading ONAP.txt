honor this morning to be with a panel of

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,310
onap leadership and for I have to say

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,439
one of the few times in my career I have

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,860

like to go through and introduce my

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,890
panelists so first up here we have all a

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,219

member of onap and we just sort of did

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,830
our first CSC meritocracy elections

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,780
within own up so I think that's

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,549
something you can be quite proud of and

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,290
she is one of the chairs of the use-case

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,939
subcommittee so all if you just want to

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,840
say a few words about yourself as we

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,939
start yeah so just probably something

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,950
interesting that you know I two years

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,290
ago then I decided that I want to change

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,930
jobs I decided that I want to try

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,299
something new and go for an open-source

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,299
and this is how I actually joined the EM

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,549
talks haven't regretted so far but for

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,079
this journey extremely interesting and

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,329

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,299
a bit and also you know speaking of one

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,090

some of the open source communities to

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,669
accelerate out a network transformation

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,370
journey I was part of that since day one

journey and we now have a dedicated team

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,500
and we see their quick value of you know

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,740

00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:40,140
we have a ji Hui Lee who is a senior

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:43,470
architect at VMware in the network

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:48,450

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:50,340
group at VMware and you are the you have

been leading and being the PTL for the

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,060
multi fin project which is obviously I

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,880
think very important as we look at

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,419
architectural transformation ahead for

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,950
you know NFV Sdn and or nav in general

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,990
thank you layer actually I'm very happy

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,419
to here to join all the excellent way

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,570
means and actually I have been leading

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:11,880
the you know development efforts and

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,580
architecture of the every product in

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,220
VMware and how to make them bite her

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,200
integrate with the ecosystem I have been

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,870
very heavily involved in two different

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,320
kind of you know open-source communities

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,780
such as Big Data and OpenStack and I'm

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,020
very happy also the committers of

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,810
OpenStack and onab also and I am very

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,090
happy when we're is more active to be to

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,409
contribute more open source world and

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,139
we're happy to be here

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,909
great all right so

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,509
now that we've all been introduced let's

00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:47,879
continue on with the panel so my first

00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,000
question actually is to you Catherine as

00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,039
a newly elected GSD chair with the

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,530
exciting but perhaps daunting task of

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,840
looking ahead over the next year what

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,639
are the sort of the biggest sort of

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,629
either challenges or your hopes for

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,520
expectations for success for onap in

00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,919
this coming year yeah where some of

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,949
maybe the focus areas you plan to to

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,469
look at as a leader yes so up to know I

00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,960
was focusing really on the execution

00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:20,129
plan of any release or wound up working

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:22,139
closely with Aaron not only at the time

00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:25,620
of the integration but also ensuring

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:28,319
that what we are delivering is aligned

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,319
with the expectation of the community so

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,409
what I will do as a chair it's with and

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:38,099
supported not only by myself but also by

00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:40,949
the order tse members and don't neglect

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:43,979
the fact that we have a high expectation

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:46,860
of hospitals and they anita supports as

00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:49,919
well as a subcommittee chair so with all

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,979
this group of people what we would like

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,409
to achieve is continue to become a

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:58,889
seamless own up in the sense that we

00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:01,169
would like to remove any identity or

00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,509
pain flute from AT&T or china mobile

00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:06,180
because we were working together to

00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,759
create the own app but we don't want

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,159
that it becomes an AT&T own of things or

00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,080
it can become a china mobile own of

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:16,979
thing I believe maybe Ling Li you agree

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,409
it should be known app community things

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:23,340
at the end so it would be important you

00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:25,590
even if we have an end user Authority

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,710
group which is composed by the the

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:31,500
operators it will also be important to

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,320
consider what the third-party vendors

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,899
will be able to deliver to meet the

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,260
expectation of the operators and also

00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,940
consider what the cloud infrastructure

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,980
because it's a big ecosystem there are

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:49,620
multiple parties can support from from

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:53,160
virtual network possibilities because

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,779
they are helping us a lot by giving us

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,069
some free

00:08:53,779 --> 00:09:01,699
laughs as well so try to demystify I try

00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:04,009
to go to more meritocratic while we are

00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:06,649
still considering the operator needs

00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:10,579
because at the end we are delivering

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:14,089
this platform for the operator and try

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,889
to move in a more agile way so far you

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:19,459
know we are reaching my stone after

00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:21,259
milestone it's a long cycle I think

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,629
there is an eagerness when you move to

00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:26,259
production to have more freaking build

00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:29,749
so you can have a kind of retrospective

00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:32,540
earlier you can understand earlier what

00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:33,709
the future feature will be deliver it

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,980
will also help

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:40,699
Ellen to be well prepared so try to

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,160
reduce maybe not the lifecycle but try

00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:46,129
to deliver more often so a lot of

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,999
improvement have been discussed over the

00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:54,290
past days so we will have a backlog as a

00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:58,399
TSE based on what type of improvement

00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:00,769
and loss unknown we have collected since

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,899
we are already set up since more than

00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:09,740
1.5 years thank you were you about to

00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:12,889
say something out no I'm fine okay

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,019
anyway thank you catherine definiteiy

00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:19,399
well I really appreciate your help in

00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:23,389
past and the olap could a success for 18

00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:25,759
ever - and right now in a third one -

00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:28,009
yes today's dinner so I was running the

00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,620
integration and weekly we are staring

00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:33,319
Barracuda ship and at least a won't give

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,360
me a good night so appreciate and also

00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:39,410
definitely looking for an extra nice

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,470
Dublin will be more stable and alas how

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:47,720
sense could be improved even more with

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:49,819
your leadership so next question Ling Li

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,670
you know sort of coming from a service

00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:54,769
provider perspective and we we certainly

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,660
hear you from from Catherine so if as a

00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,709
TSV chair but also has a service writer

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,389
but specifically as a service provider

00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:05,929
you know what what is your sort of

00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:07,580
biggest desire out of the I've seen how

00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:11,420
onap develops over

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:13,610
the next year right so um because I I'm

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,110
moving from the standards background and

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,570
you know our standards are very

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:21,230
important from for our our telecom

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,780
industry so I think we see a service

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,060
provider perhaps three layers of values

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,730
that a community like own app could

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,280
provide the first one the first layer is

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,890
actually the open reference architecture

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,220
which I think onab has been doing very

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:39,080
very good job in actually unifying all

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,840
the source about you know across the

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,770
industry how the next generation

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,800
operating supporting system would look

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,500
like the ideas or concept about

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,110
separating design time and the rank term

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,550
and also the mother driven approach and

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,890
also the data collection analytics and

00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:00,560
policy driven automation cluster um I

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,950
think those are the ideas that has been

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,930
you know voting across the industry

00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,420
going anywhere any organizations any

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:13,160
company any service provider those ideas

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,590
are you know plank and I'm taking to

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,800
China Mobile's case we are actually

00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,750
doing our next generation oh it says

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,360
assistant design and also taking

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:26,600
reference to that architecture so I

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,690
think that is a huge value you know out

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,020
of this community and the second level I

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,960
think would be you know you know

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:39,290
decoupling those modules and provide

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,800
reference implementation of the workflow

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:46,970
the api's and also Demark the models

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,160
between them so it's not the saying that

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:52,220
the community has to deliver production

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,790
level source code but by having you know

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,680
demonstration use cases and also you

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,930
know testing in terminology between

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,800
different commercial solutions against

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,570
this platform we would know that based

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,760
on this architecture based on those

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,610
specifications those different modules

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,130
could interoperable together and it

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,770
would project the future that the vision

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:19,670
that you know or our partners could take

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:21,200
a row in this big picture but not having

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,810
to dictating one

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,320
service provider or any vendor to

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:29,420
provide own a platform as a whole so I

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,160
think that is the second level of value

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,310
that we could gain from his community

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,490
and we have been working hard you know

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,670
with AT&T and also our partners to try

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:43,670
to define a common light a suite of API

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,560
eyes or even you know providing flexible

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,600
options and options to different

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,970
providers to specific use cases about

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,280
this so that we can all benefit from

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,890
those reference specifications and

00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,580
enable interoperability both internally

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,440
and externally and the last one I think

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,160
it is a common value of the open source

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,200
community is that if we have a mature

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,060
enough source code well you know service

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,060
providers like us could actually

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,930
leverage the source code and perhaps you

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,910
know making our own solutions that is

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,880
something that we are starting to do you

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,580
know this year and like dr. Phil

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,500
mentioned in her keynote yesterday we

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,050
have been doing trials with some of the

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,810
components that we picked from our net

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:32,240
Beijing release and we're doing trials

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:39,850
in now use cases which is dedicated to

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:43,910
core network virtualization right so way

00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:47,360
from a vendor perspective you know what

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:50,390
are you know what what are you hoping to

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:55,280
sort of you know experience or kind of

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:58,490
see the impact of onap yeah actually

00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,520
that's a very good question because I

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:04,340
think and I provide a very good channel

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,530
as an open community for different roles

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,020
to work together and the cooperator

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:13,180
together and to understand the each

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:16,220
other better and to you know such how to

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,770
contribute the you know bigger go to

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,980
Kyler's so that's a miracle channel and

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:25,790
we have so much you know new trends

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,220
today such as 50 edge computing I always

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,950
trans we need to work together to

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,050
achieve them and actually different

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,299
company have a different other one pages

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,389
and accumulations in different view

00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:41,989
and we can now adjust you know what a

00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:44,839
long today it's as such you know a huge

00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:47,209
world so we need to you can buy the

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,879
other one pagers from different company

00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:53,079
together to achieve a goal and the owner

00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,279
could be a future de facto you know in

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:58,909
industry standard

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,009
so maybe towards that goal all of us can

00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:04,189
you know based on the same understanding

00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:07,129
to contribute side for example you

00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:09,019
November already initiated the multi

00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:12,229
beam project with several partners

00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:16,009
together visit AT&T China Mobile Intel

00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:19,399
Microsoft AMM a.m. talks together - you

00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:22,939
know provider cloud agnostic supposed to

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,959
the cloud to the owner actually that's a

00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:28,399
start point we try to contribute more to

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,659
achieve you know a better future

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,199
together

00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:35,119
so do you have made alla do you have

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,289
anything to add I mean you know I know

00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:40,669
you spent a lot of time thinking about

00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:44,059
use cases excuse me last day of the

00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:46,429
conference my voice always goes you know

00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:48,769
you know sort of beam down it you know

00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:51,339
kind of in the use case discussion you

00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:54,169
know has that impacted you know sort of

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:57,589
any you know your company's direction or

00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:59,809
you know it has that you had your sort

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:02,149
of positive or kind of unexpected impact

00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,919
you know for y'all sort of being in

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,110
those use case conversations your to

00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,749
your point of understanding working

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:12,350
together actually in the open source

00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:13,850
yeah so basically as I said I'm chairing

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,159
the Yusuke subcommittee a phono

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,949
actually since its inception and you

00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:20,360
know at the beginning we started from

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:22,939
actual immersion the code base of a

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,519
company Brno and showcasing it on some

00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:27,709
use cases which were required in the

00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,509
very first release again the major goal

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,519
was actually to showcase that the code

00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:34,639
base works those use cases varies

00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,549
identify CP volt and wilderness to show

00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:39,200
feral but then moving forward in Beijing

00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,240
released a major focus was on

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,070
non-functional requirements and now that

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,619
we on the Casablanca and especially

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,809
moving forward to Dublin you know which

00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:48,740
really gets us closer to some real

00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:51,590
deployments very

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,690
you know get to implement many more use

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,460
cases which had demanded by industry

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,230
right now and will be demanded in the

00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,540
future and as a fact yes the difference

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,160
since we had a panel on five G and H

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,080
automation we should become in very

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,150
relevant and you know we had like I

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,890
think seven sessions in parallel so I

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,470
was a bit concerned how many people will

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,330
come to the room the room was full

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,370
actually so that only shows how relevant

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,550
you know this thing is to industry

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:19,040
because again we are moving to the real

00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,390
deployments hopefully and then you know

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,970
the real feedback from service providers

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,640
is needed and actually you know what I

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,020
was also try to achieve being a use case

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,610
subcommittee she is to get as many

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,040
feedback from service provider as

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,020
possible both in the proactive way then

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,450
they bring their requirements and then

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,580
they are on questions that we might have

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,559
now as a company position I think it

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,929
goes in the same way so you know of

00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,340
course you know each one of us works in

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,710
the community but also represents its

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,450
own company and leading own of

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,370
activities internally you know I come

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,380
back and say okay so we have that

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,940
feedback from service provider X we have

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,950
this feedback from service provider why

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,780
those use cases I need it and that

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,390
somehow you know influences also our

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,790
roadmap and where we want to influence

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,100
on up in which direction clearly five G

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,590
and H automation are those areas that we

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,179
have becoming more and more involved

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:11,720
isn't I don't know I would like to add

00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:15,410
something so today the own up committee

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,230
her present I mean a wireless provider

00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:21,650
that serve 70% of the global wireless

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,570
subscriber so it means that yes we are

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,179
speaking about deployment in production

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,830
of course AT&T has a platform deployed

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:30,950
since more than three years

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:33,380
I know Ling Li you have friendly user

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,940
has well since a long time with the open

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,920
or component and and now you are

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,140
integrating additional components

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,410
well Canada has already started to move

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,900
in production but we only three so we

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:48,080
will need and I know orange just release

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:51,230
an air FP to invite their vendors also

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,330
to be on up compliance so one of the

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,370
challenge will be through the use case

00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,640
community to the architecture is to

00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:02,120
understand what are we missing so

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,970
additional carriers can consume it

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,090
in their premises and now it will really

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,220
become a worldwide platform and and

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:13,010
already recognized as a standard

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,430
platform but in reality it had to be in

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:19,130
production yeah yeah if I may add I

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:21,350
think you know the work and you use care

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,620
subcommittee led by Alan has been doing

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:27,050
a fantastic job because you know onab is

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,300
a huge platform and thanks for the

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:32,960
contribution from them you know

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:35,570
also a Catherine's team / it sometimes

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,270
you know other service providers with

00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,080
struggling understanding this power and

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:45,440
how it can apply to their real realistic

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,240
use case and uske subcommittee tried to

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,820
collect all the ideas from different

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,210
service providers and share their ideas

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,120
and combine combine them and map them

00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,990
into functional or non-functional

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,810
requirements with the help of

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,760
architecture subcommittee which kind of

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,800
like filling the gap between the service

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,410
provider they're talking you know in

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,200
their language in their requirements but

00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,850
the ptl's behind them who are supporting

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,040
who would be supporting delivering the

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:16,100
features in the release cadence they're

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,840
speaking in their language but you see

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,030
subcommittee and architectures up a

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,330
committee together they're just bridging

00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:26,030
them and to the barricade job I totally

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,910
agree with Langley because we have

00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:32,300
noticed that the PTL we are working some

00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:34,400
time in silo but really focusing on

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,010
their project and only start to interact

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,900
with the other components when they need

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,650
you have a flow that they need to

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,470
validate together so another opportunity

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:47,420
of improvement will be 200 thanks to the

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,240
architecture team and I'll use his

00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,600
committee to start to demonstrate

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,480
additional and to an flow or more demo

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,610
so it can not only we don't invent a

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,220
license for the platform but people

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:05,360
start now to understand how to use it

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:08,480
how to tweak it from a vnf perspective I

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,200
mean in order to you for the Vienna

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,540
founders they can already test their vnf

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,650
before the commercial is commercialize

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,770
them and

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,950
sell them back to the carrier so it's a

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:25,100
kind of academic research environment

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:27,110
but again we we need to break this type

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,840
of silos it does not mean that people

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:32,570
are not working together that's not what

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,110
I meant but due to the fact that we have

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:38,120
I think lingly we have 30 projects as an

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,850
open source is quite big we know they're

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,370
open source even that are even bigger

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,110
but that's a challenge since at the

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,830
beginning I think but we are working

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:52,940
well I mean it's a challenge but it's

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,530
nothing nothing it's impossible yeah one

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,780
of the things I love about being an open

00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:00,140
source right is that there always seems

00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,790
to be this sort of focus on continuous

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,280
improvement right you know I think

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,110
people you know we have a certain I

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,000
think pragmatism I think often in

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:11,180
open-source communities where we're

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,350
aware of what could be optimized right

00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,030
and sometimes when people here has

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,620
talked about this could be better they

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,120
assume we're talking about a problem

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,680
when we really just always want

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,620
everything to be better

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,710
I would actually echo for for that one

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:27,530
is Allah your new skills subcommittee

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,320
afraid are very good and an important a

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:33,950
road to banners just like yesterday we

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,740
had a canal on our unclear every this

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,870
beauty and kick us I'll tell here I'll

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,270
talk about the balance between New

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,810
Year's kiss and also the s repeat

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:47,690
because on one side we want as a lava

00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:51,650
has a huge codebase on one side we want

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:55,910
it stable and all side the community an

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:58,580
industry what market excited if we don't

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:01,670
have new use kids added to support the

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,280
new use case for each tyrannies so the

00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:06,140
banners you guys need to keep of course

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,540
because OLAP is huge it just like

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:11,270
Catherine said we currently have 30

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,820
project and also summer project also has

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:17,330
a sub project and each project is kind

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,730
of huge use care subcommittee architects

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,430
some committee and also modern in

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:25,700
subcommittee this week a subcommittee I

00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:28,370
think is very very important for law lab

00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,130
committee you know way to define some

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,740
kind of you

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:35,100
to fight architecture to balance between

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,710
those solo of each project provide the

00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,930
use cases as a requirement and also

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,840
architecture how to implement that and

00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:45,330
determine the flow how to interact from

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,390
each other and also the standard API our

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:52,140
data model in between those kind of

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:54,360
project I think those sub can be is very

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,720
important and also you guys all did a

00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,540
fantastic job on that one of course we

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,150
could do better

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,150
[Laughter]

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:14,280
we're talking about the number of

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:17,730
projects Helen you do God's work and you

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,250
know yeah the the difficulty of the job

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,210
being the integration PTL I think is one

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,490
of those things that cannot be

00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,950
overstated for any open source project

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,290
you have to help pull all that kind of

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:31,250
stuff together so you know how do you

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:34,020
approach that and how does that work I

00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:40,830
sure that's the interesting part and

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:41,800
also maybe I'm the person really like to

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,800
take a challenge

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,620
[Laughter]

00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:51,240
I was earlier scanning for the audience

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:53,370
to say you feels over here last master

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:58,890
illness to the north of our game we

00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:02,580
discuss OLAP is a fat baby they're

00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:05,700
kissing about fat baby our lap in one

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:08,190
side Olaf has a huge codebase that's

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,860
very big pharma is that is the biggest

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:14,430
open source I have been working with so

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,950
far but he's a baby in a way it's not

00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:20,640
really mature on stable at this current

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:23,580
point as we expected as people hope I

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,610
mean the community doing a very very

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:29,490
good job on this one so you integrate

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:32,490
them together is not an easy job for the

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:35,790
integrating team the team did a

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:40,070
fantastic job they need to be a cloud

00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:42,900
and I mean they needed to be a network

00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:45,270
system engineer they also need

00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,880
our deeper of developer Python developer

00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,130
a lot of a lot a lot of skills so you

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,550
could put as a sense together

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:58,170
thanks for the Olaf community and since

00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:01,110
we have all main developer more so I

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:03,720
especially appreciate them for the whole

00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:07,170
support and a collaboration and also

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:10,170
trust to put to successful release just

00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:13,080
like Cerner and we said what matching

00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:15,960
the third one we already passed m4

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,960
milestone and we doing good job of

00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,380
course we could do better you know not

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,650
always

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,110
for example the architect could design

00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,240
better to make the older project could

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,240
be more seamlessly working together

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:33,540
right now I definitely could see a lot

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:37,620
of code is not a really married together

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:40,070
night agreed zero basically this kind of

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:45,000
piece and to support other use case

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:47,670
sorry we have some hard-coded code and

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,580
also we have some kind of branch

00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,740
workaround and those error definitely we

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,370
could do better in the future release

00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:59,490
and I think we have confident to make

00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,620
that a better and also provide a more

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:05,220
automation early also responsible

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:09,330
Catherine talked about be more agile she

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:11,910
said as a help us actually it's also has

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:14,460
a higher requirement for the integration

00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,860
team and as a whole app as well if we

00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,540
need to continues the release even

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,510
though that here's our dream that he is

00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:25,020
great but continuous release recall very

00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:28,260
very high automation and SAS ad the

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:32,310
whole tour chains over there with such a

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:36,810
big codebase and also so many sins over

00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:38,340
there it's very challenge like I put to

00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:42,840
the four layers of a test

00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:46,470
modeling in the OLAP community you test

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,210
CSIT testing and also on another

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,160
component they in there of the like a

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,510
pyramid testing and as we have

00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,820
end-to-end testing I expect to be

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:59,430
automated but right now each of them

00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,860
we don't get a hundred percent which

00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:04,680
will make next layer even higher like

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,070
yesterday when we we passed em for last

00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,800
week this as yesterday my check their

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:14,610
progress of hairline testing I don't say

00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:16,440
any results at the moment so we have we

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:20,420
have quite some work to do

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:24,180
could it do better but I cross my finger

00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:26,790
put in place already great tools I mean

00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,040
with the automation that your team and

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,990
and the committee did I mean I'm

00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,960
thinking about the fact that now at any

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:38,700
times we know if all the labs are up we

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:42,390
have great great graphs that anybody can

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,700
access from the community to see the

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,720
application is up in the different labs

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:51,420
that we have you also check if the

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,800
container restarting so focusing on the

00:29:51,420 --> 00:30:00,690
stability so we are building up so give

00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:03,450
up I'm very optimistic on this one like

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:07,530
yesterday orange Erica and his team

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:10,560
demonstrated some very good say sales ad

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:12,210
from the open if we community we condemn

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,510
ridges some of them just like a earlier

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:18,210
said use their tools could attest if the

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,610
cloud is ready to do some kind basic a

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,610
check and a layer by near to check on

00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:26,610
sense and as an educator some kind of

00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:30,030
sense we're definitely looking forward

00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:33,870
that but I just kind of say OLAP is very

00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:36,030
very unique open-source project so we

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,730
need a handle yet you know related

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:41,670
different way we may be needed to create

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,400
something pretty unique specific for all

00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:48,180
up even the industry standard IT is

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,980
agile or continuous release like a model

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,830
you've give for that he's a good one at

00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:56,010
least I don't see that could happen he

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:59,310
next well to release because a la Sol as

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:03,150
our reality is OLAP as a platform it's

00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:06,750
different than other open source they

00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:08,670
could do a service like cloud native or

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,700
dozens even though people talk about

00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,820
that one

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,940
a buzzword but I think if this is a

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,399
correct model for OLAP because our lab

00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,700
is powerful we wanted to relate here

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:26,740
stable and also the dependency among

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:33,639
that hundreds 38 docker images current

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:36,610
leaders as we have and it's not easy the

00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:38,669
operation alone app manager project did

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,260
a fantastic job to work on the

00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:42,789
containerization zing we made you you

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,409
would like to share with us what you did

00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:46,269
with the multi vein because if we are

00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:48,220
able to deploy it on different

00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:51,010
environments I think they have been some

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,620
work that you will leave deliberately

00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:55,750
because actually I come from IT world I

00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,120
just decided you know this is a very

00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:01,210
good channel for everyone to understand

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,820
each other better so I think the use

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,850
case driven integration is a very good

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,830
window to breeze you ever in together we

00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,539
already have a very good see ICT

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,940
infrastructure from different

00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:15,940
communities between her high roof opens

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,850
dike opf we actually we can totally work

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,250
together to see if they see it is a you

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,529
know what's a bicep righties for this

00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:26,159
community and we can work together to

00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:29,559
identify our best way to move forward

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,289
and I am certainly a believer in CI CDI

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:36,700
I have gotten that religion completely

00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:38,769
so it's great to hear that so um you

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,620
know we're we're you know we've had a

00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:43,090
lot of good discussion and you know one

00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,610
of the things that I really appreciate

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,409
about this panel is a lot of times when

00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:50,080
you're a woman in the tech industry and

00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:52,360
you're invited on stage you're invited

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,010
to talk about being a woman in tech

00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,580
while you're talking about being a woman

00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:59,980
in tech on stage you're you don't often

00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,590
get the opportunity to actually talk

00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:05,380
about your work or to be a woman in tech

00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,630
you always are sort of in this meta

00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,519
space and we've just had you know I

00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,309
think 30 you know 30 minutes of

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:16,570
conversation with six women who are

00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:18,730
leaders in a very important open source

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,889
community here talking about our vision

00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,139
and our challenges and the technology

00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:23,670
and the use cases and I think that's

00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:25,410
amazing

00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,480
but I also think that we would you know

00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,100
sort of be remiss if we didn't take just

00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,740
a little bit of opportunity to kind of

00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,060
say you know it's a positive exception

00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,890
you know when Allah was proposing this

00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:38,340
panel she was like it's great because

00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:39,780
you know ona is a positive exception in

00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,130
that there are so many women leaders

00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:45,330
there are a number and opie NFV as well

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,460
you know and I just like to you know

00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:49,020
maybe you know ask some of the panelists

00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,720
I'll start with you Allah since you know

00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,730
this was this was your grand vision this

00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,390
panel do you think there's anything in

00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,510
particular about

00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:00,270
onap or open source that you think has

00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:02,910
given rise to you know having this many

00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:04,710
women in influential positions yeah so

00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,630
we've been discussed as created because

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,910
I think which is quite unique in the

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,950
industry that we have so many female

00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:13,200
leaders but actually thinking about it

00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,480
you know open source environment is not

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,970
only about technical side of the story

00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,480
but mostly I would say about you know

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:23,429
emotional and you know psychology

00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,110
understanding people working with people

00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,960
because you know you're not a leader

00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:30,419
because you were assigned by someone yes

00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,820
your company can send you to work on

00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:34,440
open source eventually your skills are

00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,570
determined your skills to work and

00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,940
community I determined by how people if

00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,040
people listen to you if people are ready

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,620
and willing to follow you how they

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,140
follow you and visit you indeed you know

00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,240
have that force you know to convince

00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,710
people not to force people because again

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,900
this is not a company than someone

00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,090
appointed to you this is a much more

00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,429
complicated society than you have to

00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,890
prove your skills your social skills

00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,900
also on the constant basis and this is

00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,150
the place where actually women can play

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:07,140
a key role because you know we do have

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:09,900
those skills I would say so and and we

00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,150
face it really no Nepean on up we do

00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,980
have all these women that you can see on

00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,920
the stage you know we lead activities

00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,170
you know and in general what also I

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,350
would also like to touch what can be

00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:24,360
done more because the fact is that we do

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:27,960
have quite a few you know leading women

00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,700
we do not have that many developers or I

00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,980
would say I would like to see more

00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,200
developers or I would not like to see

00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,180
more you know women becoming PTL and

00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,580
even you know even more coming to the

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,290
leading position and

00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,510
probably the way to do that would be you

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,820
know having some joint activities you

00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,770
know putting some emphasis for that as a

00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,840
fact we had you know the day before

00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,820
yesterday we had the women lunch

00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,840
sponsored by Linux Foundation I think it

00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,820
was great

00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,920
you know an opportunity to meet with

00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,080
each other and probably we have to do

00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,000
the same inside the phone up you know

00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,220
when we have developer forms you know

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,550
encourage all those newcomers so

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:06,920
developers you know to come to get to

00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:09,590
know each other to to get them excited

00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,600
about the opportunity which open source

00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:15,110
actually provides here which i think is

00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,670
quite unique there any other comments

00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,240
yeah and I also just any kind of

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:22,190
comments on sort of culture I mean I

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,050
live very near Silicon Valley there's a

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,120
lot of conversation going on about women

00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,680
in tech and Silicon Valley I think it's

00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,470
kind of fascinating the only American up

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,650
here you know or are there things that

00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,700
you think that you find for yourselves

00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,960
where you're coming from either company

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,990
wise or geographically culturally that

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,690
you know you think are lessons that

00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:47,810
you'd like sort of the broader folks to

00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,310
take that you've maybe experienced from

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,830
a your positive point of view because

00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:53,360
you know how can we you know that sort

00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:56,810
of ethics how can how can we do better

00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,570
how can we be better perhaps not from

00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:03,140
you know female from the gender side by

00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:06,200
sea you know people from Asia and they

00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,670
turn to be more reserved especially and

00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,430
you know when they're from a technical

00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,650
you know backgrounds sometimes they

00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,650
could be you know hard for them to speak

00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:20,840
up and express themselves especially if

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:23,150
it is like I'm opposing like an opinion

00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,670
and sometimes it's because you know

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:28,490
they're afraid they would be making a

00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:31,160
technical mistake but a personal

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,170
experience from myself is that you know

00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,740
you should always speak up every think

00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,990
differently

00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,450
otherwise there will be no meaning for

00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,310
you to be within this community you're

00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,860

00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,900
yourself and also the company behind you

00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,390

encouraging you know our Chinese

00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:03,560
participants also from my partners or

00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:06,350

patient and you know accommodating our

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,500
you know not so good English and hearing

00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,900
our opinions and I think there are a lot

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,360
of Florence in you know net and other

00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,030
communities that more and more Asian

00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,340
participants and also some of them are

00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,980
you know in the leadership position so

00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,870
their voice needs to be heard and it is

00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:36,560
has been a more and more you know

00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:41,540
appreciated I also want to add a little

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:46,070
bit I feel as a woman working the high

00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:50,000
tech very lucky of this sense and also I

00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:53,420
guess most of the woman in here as well

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,270
it's like other support we get from our

00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,370
families and all other sense like when

00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:03,920
we were here our families take care our

00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:06,860
kids and my cats everything that kind of

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,680
work I definitely appreciate only with

00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,320
their support we could do whatever we

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,740
need to do a lot of time on the society

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,650
the reason why from Archie from the

00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:21,560
elementary to from the from the

00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:24,290
undergraduate school you could see in

00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:27,050
the stem field there's much much less

00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:29,630
woman is because the society is

00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:32,660
appearance a lot of environment the

00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:35,660
influence who caused that but I feel I'm

00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,060
very lucky to get encouraged to pursue

00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:40,880
my dream and also secondly Irene

00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:43,700

00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:49,340
of investment for the integrating team

00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:51,710
to put full time job to basically purely

00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,880

00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,520
