good afternoon everybody how are you

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,700
doing so my name is Rajesh courier I

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,700
lead architecture efforts I'm CTO for

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,170
Intel's networking business and it's an

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,509
absolute pleasure to be here in

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,859
Amsterdam this week so I'm going to talk

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:24,420
about 5g and the innovations at the

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:27,000
network edge if I asked each one of you

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,730
in the room here what your perspective

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,560
is on 5g I'm likely going to get many

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,309
different answers perhaps as many as the

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,270
number of people in the room here and

00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,829
perhaps for some of you

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,899
5g is still a little bit further away

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,480
maybe a couple of years maybe longer

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,200
but for us especially for somebody like

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,710
me who works on network infrastructure

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,149
5g is here and now and in fact we've

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,360
been actually hard at work over the last

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,410
couple of years

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,360
transforming the network virtualizing

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:07,590
the network trying to get it ready for

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:11,159
the impending 5g transition so you know

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,159
thinking about some of the possibilities

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,770
with 5g and all the innovation one thing

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
that all of you would agree that 5g does

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,960
mean a lot of data all that innovation

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,740
all that new services would lead to a

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,619
lot of data and so if you sort of like

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,659
think about like so the the the research

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:37,320
studies in the market today I'll share a

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:42,180
couple of data points over the next four

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,670
to five years 70% of world's population

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,299
is going to have a smartphone in fact

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,420
90% of people or the age of 6 would have

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,610
some kind of a mobile device and 50% of

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,430
the data that is produced by 2020

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,549
will be through the things phenomenon or

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:04,649
by machines so if you look at some of

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:07,380
the comparison by 2020 a human user

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,929
would produce 1.5 gigabytes of data per

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,610
day now in comparison autonomous

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,069
vehicles are going to produce 4

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,769
terabytes of data per day

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,079
and connected planes would produce five

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:21,090
terabytes of data per diem smart

00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:23,129
factories a petabyte of data per day

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,549
that's a thousand terabytes and you look

00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:27,030
at cloud video providers that's 750 para

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:29,670
bytes

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:37,109
just imagine what that means 750

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:39,209
petabytes now so across the board with

00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:41,909
all this innovation new services and

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,590
that data deluge from a network

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,579
infrastructure perspective what that

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:51,989
means is we go to need a scalable

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:55,049
programmable and intelligent network so

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,859
when you think about 5g and you look at

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:01,319
it from an end-to-end perspective from

00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:03,900
the axis to the network edge to the core

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,239
to the cloud data center what you see

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,120
here is a little data center a little

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,299
cloud everywhere in the ran at the edge

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,450
in the network core and of course the

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:18,120
cloud now one of the happening places as

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,099
a result of 5g what I like to refer to

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,769
as the epicenter of services innovation

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,470
is going to be at the axis and at the

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,979
edge now two things are happening here

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,859
from an edge perspective one we are

00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,690
seeing a lot of consolidation of and

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,549
convergence of network functions so

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,310
what's happening is with all the work

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:41,280
that we have done with NFC and Sdn or

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,609
the last few years we are seeing a

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,579
convergence of fixed network of course

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,840
mobile network and also the cable

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,449
infrastructure all coming together

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,329
nicely and converging at the network

00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,769
edge now the second part of it is

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,599
actually much more interesting which is

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,169
actually all the new services that are

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,359
going to be enabled as a result of the

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:05,459
5g technology which has 10x lower

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,510
latency and 10x better bandwidth as

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:12,299
compared to LT so what you see here in

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,060
terms of new services a lot of that is

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,859
going to be led by video as you guys

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,810
know 70 to 80 percent of the network

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,740
traffic is video and so you could

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,919
actually see things like real-time video

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,960
transcoding immersive media and video

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,030
analytics and AI everywhere

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,100
and then we will also actually start

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,320
you're seeing a lot of interest in

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:39,100
blockchain communities because a lot of

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,900
what 5g enables is really service

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,760
communities and in those service

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,470
communities it becomes very important to

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,510
be able to actually share data between

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,640
the users in that service community and

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,200
blockchain as a technology becomes very

00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,830
interesting because of its distributed

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,510
ledger and because of a secure way of

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,900
sharing data within that service

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,700
community now the cloud itself is

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,240
evolving as well and we are seeing

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,100
actually more and more innovations like

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,710
the cloud native service mesh

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,360
architectures new paradigms like

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,290
function as a service back end as a

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,050
service API gateways we're seeing

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,240
analytics everywhere AI everywhere and a

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,710
lot of what is happening in cloud also

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,419
applies in at the network edge now one

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,200
of the key tenets of nfe was going to be

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:31,330
network automation and this is an area

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,130
that I strongly believe we have a lot

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,760
more work to do and this actually

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,440
applies across the network now we've

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,600
actually made some good strides with

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,870
onap but there's actually more to be

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,490
done in terms of how we instead of

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,710
having to roll a truck every time we

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,140
create and deploy a service the ability

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,910
to automate and be able to actually

00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:58,330
create a service from a central location

00:05:51,910 --> 00:06:00,910
so what's the big hoopla about when it

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,260
comes to edge so when you think about

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,900
some of these new services we are

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,930
talking about from a 5g perspective you

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:11,200
think about things like autonomous

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:14,410
driving things like immersive media and

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,850
video analytics things like drones one

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,600
thing that is actually common between

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:22,060
all of them is that they all desire

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:26,890
ultra-low latency and so if you look at

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:28,240
this diagram the reason why edge becomes

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,720
the epicenter of this service innovation

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,229
is because the latency that is required

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,140
by these applications is of the order of

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:41,050
five milliseconds or perhaps even lower

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,830
and the only way to do that in spite of

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,840
the

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,700
better latency characteristics with 5g

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,220
is to be able to actually host these

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:55,270
applications and these services at the

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:58,120
network edge so when you look at the

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,550
network edge now edge where is this

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,450
mythical edge now edge can mean a few

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,270
different things for different people

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,250
but for me actually and actually most of

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,090
the calls service providers or the telco

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:14,560
operators the edge as in the central

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:18,360
office edge is of a lot of interest and

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,640
the reason for that is because this is

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,890
such a precious real estate that is

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,130
available very close to customers both

00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:30,400
enterprise and end-users and as a result

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,680
the ability to drive innovations by

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,890
hosting applications and services at

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,320
that network edge is something that

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,760
would transform not just a business but

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,490
it has the potential of transforming our

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,980
lives so here what I thought I would do

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,900
is show you a few examples of what these

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,980
central offices look like and they

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,130
actually come in different shapes and

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,230
sizes and as you can see here this like

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,270
a small Hut at the bottom which is like

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,450
an aggregation office or aggregation

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,280
Center to maybe a midsize central office

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,230
to something that you see at the top

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,910
which is a multi-story building and a

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:08,020
few floors sort of like housing central

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:10,630
offices and I actually tried to plot

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,930
what this looks like in a place like us

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,730
there are 20,000 such central offices so

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,380
you can just imagine the magnitude of

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,140
what this transformation could mean if

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,240
you actually put a little data center in

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,310
each of these central offices and what

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,160
kind of innovation what kind of low

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,400
latency services can that drive now

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:34,440
that's just in u.s. in comparison if you

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,200
look at China there are 70,000 of these

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:42,040
so I think when you look at what's

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:45,190
possible this transformation and the

00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:48,190
potential to actually drive these new

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,710
services enabled by 5g at the network

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,150
edge at the central offices transforming

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,720
the central offices it's a huge

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,720
opportunity

00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:03,029
so now of course one of the fundamental

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:06,120
foundational enablers for 5g and these

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,680
edge services is really the network

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,540
transformation the work that we have

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,380
together been driving over the last few

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:17,370
years in the form of nfe and Sdn and if

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,270
anything 5g and edge services are

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,830
actually going to put a lot more

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,810
pressure and we need to actually

00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,640
continue to do the network

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:27,800
transformation journey continue to

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,800
virtualize the network with more urgency

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:35,130
let me actually give you a couple of

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:37,320
examples that will illustrate what how

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,950
the the flexibility that is introduced

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,740
by NFV is critical for the next wave of

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:46,230
services at the network edge so one of

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,850
the sample applications one of the

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,920
applications that we've all been working

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,740
towards virtualizing is the packet core

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,750
or the EPC or the old packet core and a

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,460
key function there is the user plane or

00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,720
the packet gateway and so you can

00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:04,140
imagine an application such as an IOT

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,300
gateway for forming the packet gateway

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,029
associated with that can be located in

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,680
the cloud because for that application

00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:13,080
there really is not a big sensitivity

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,000
with respect to latency or there's not a

00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,950
huge amount of bandwidth and so we're

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,420
perfectly okay taking that disaggregated

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,130
packet gateway and putting it in the

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,589
cloud somewhere now

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,440
another example if we are actually

00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:29,400
trying to enhance the user experience in

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,130
a stadium with a 360 video maybe with

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,380
some AR then that same packet gateway

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,390
needs to be located as close to the user

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,020
as possible perhaps within the stadium

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,820
itself and yet another example of a

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,440
content delivery network a CDN maybe

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,959
that packet get for that user plane is

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,360
okay locate in in a central office like

00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:52,190
I was showing earlier so all of this

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,510
flexibility is what is foundational to

00:10:52,190 --> 00:11:00,360
how we are going to actually be able to

00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:02,370
deploy 5g and the edge services now from

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,650
an Intel perspective here's the journey

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,890
that we've been on and you guys have

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,730
heard us talk about this we've actually

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,430
spent a lot of time

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:14,310
I'm on the workload convergence and have

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,260
made great progress so this is where we

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,149
do application control plain packet

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,910
processing or the user plain or data

00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,639
plane and signal processing such as

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,430
media workloads or baseband processing

00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,970
on base stations all running efficiently

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,370
on a general-purpose server architecture

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,769
now we have to continue to make progress

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,079
on this and some of the things that we

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:40,769
are trying to do as a next step here

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:43,079
preparing for 5g is driving for the

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,149
innovations in DP DK which is actually

00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,800
our foundational enabler for efficient

00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,889
packet processing so what you're doing

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,070
there is looking at evolving DP DK with

00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:55,220
a hardware abstraction or a device

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,380
abstraction layer so we can accelerate

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:02,190
the data planes with four technologies

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:05,730
such as crypto with FPGA smart necks and

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:10,130
so on we are also looking at evolving DP

00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,180
DK for cloud native applications because

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,699
networking is no longer going to be

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,589
about layer 2 layer 3 networking I think

00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,850
in a world three four five years from

00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,800
now networking is going to be

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,180
increasingly about layer four to layer

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,829
seven networking and service mesh

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,589
architectures and so we are looking at

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:27,449
what that means in terms of DP DK packet

00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:30,720
processing on general-purpose server

00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:32,660
architecture and signal processing so

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,510
here we are looking at how do we improve

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,690
video processing video transcoding on

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,519
standard server architecture the second

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,980
part of our strategy was network

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,690
transformation and of course we've made

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,510
great progress there I think you look at

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,910
examples such as virtual CPE and SD van

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:54,120
in enterprise networks or EPC and

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,980
virtual IMS in the wireless core there

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,959
are numerous examples where increasingly

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,579
the network functions are being deployed

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:04,889
with NFC and Sdn now with five G and H

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:09,029
computing increasingly people are going

00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:10,740
are asking the question nf3 yes but how

00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:12,089
about cloud ready and cloud native

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,240
applications and so that's going to be

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,410
this the the additional focus now or the

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,649
next couple of years as we actually

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,050
begin for begin to roll out five G and H

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:25,260
services and then the

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,970
part here intel takes great pride in how

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,820
we collaborate and work with the open

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,750
source community and I think there's

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,940
numerous examples

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,800
DPD K of course is something that we

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,320
created and it's in the open source now

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,899
but we also actually have an excellent

00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,120
participation collaboration in onap OPN

00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,769
Fe and many other open source projects

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,290
and of course we actually collaborate

00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:52,769
with many service providers and OEMs

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:54,300
like you see on this page here so next

00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,300
actually you know one thing I wanted to

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,339
talk about a question that I get asked a

00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,940
lot as the CTO for the networking

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,709
business

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,230
I get asked hey you know how do you look

00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:06,240
at the key tenants of network

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,649
architecture what are some of the key

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,350
vectors that we need to actually push

00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:13,110
harder on and so I was thinking about

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,680
that as I was actually preparing for my

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,600
keynote here and I want to capture it on

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,810
a single foil so what you see here on

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,279
this page are the three vectors that we

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,630
are pushing really hard in terms of

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,970
innovation first is what I like to call

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,560
scale-up and so this is where we want to

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,149
actually improve the performance per

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,980
watt per dollar

00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:37,020
these are innovations such as new

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,320
instructions for packet processing for

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,380
baseband processing new kinds of

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,970
accelerators and fundamentally improving

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,860
the general-purpose server architecture

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,970
to convert it into best encase

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,810
best-in-class

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:56,430
Network platform scale-up second is

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:58,230
scale out this is disaggregation and the

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,120
vision of creating pools of compute

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,450
pools of networking pools of storage

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,699
pools of accelerators and my vision

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,649
really is if you look at four or five

00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:09,810
years from now you should be able to

00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:13,020
compose a service by pulling these

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,940
resources out of these pools so

00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,399
dynamically create an application a

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,220
service no matter where the resources

00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,320
lie in the cloud and so that's what I

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,329
like to call scale out and then of

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,269
course the middle vector here is

00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:29,810
automation and you know we've actually

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:33,390
done a lot of work here in terms of

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,890
getting the platform telemetry and to be

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,940
able to do

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,590
build resilience and fault tolerance but

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,940
there's more work to be done and in fact

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,400
one of the areas that we're going to

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,200
push hard here is the ability to apply

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,360
machine learning to all this platform

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,950
telemetry data so we can really close

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,410
the loop and drive Network automation

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:58,950
faster so the three key tenants then

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:05,160
again scale up scale out and network

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:07,680
automation so just a quick word on the

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,650
portfolio products Intel offers for 5g

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,480
and for edge services of course I have

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,580
to do a little advertising blue blood

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,380
runs thick in my arteries and veins so

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,360
here's sort of like the Intel's

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:23,220
portfolio of products what you see here

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:26,370
is a nice scalable set of products entry

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,470
level SOC s that integrate Ethernet even

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,880
switching capabilities and accelerators

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:34,470
for crypto and other workloads to the

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,080
xeon d processors so one of the things

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,610
that we're going to need at the edge is

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,460
efficient and high performance within

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,560
the power and thermal constraints of the

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,980
network edge and so we have xeon d

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,270
processors here that provide up to 200

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,950
gigabits per second of application

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,960
throughput and then of course intel's

00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,150
flagship xeon processors that scale all

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,000
the way up to 600 gigabits per second

00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,970
today in terms of what a single dual

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,730
socket Xeon server can do in terms of

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,130
packet processing now when you actually

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,290
combine all that with the platform

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,080
technologies such as our 3d crosspoint

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,810
technology memory technology our next

00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,810
generation of 3d crosspoint SSDs FPGAs

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,270
and the silicon photonics technology and

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,940
you have everything that you need to

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,410
build scalable efficient and intelligent

00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,970
platforms for the next generation

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:29,400
network infrastructure so bringing it

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:33,150
all together I just want to conclude

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,620
with a few things here first Phi G is

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:39,360
here and now so it's not something that

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:41,850
is you know very far I think the work

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,830
that we are doing today is to really

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:47,400
transform the network and prepare the

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,630
network infrastructure with not just the

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,030
hardware technologies but

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,470
also key elements of software that are

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,770
going to actually drive towards a more

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,870
cloud native and an efficient

00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:04,590
infrastructure that can support 5g and

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:06,150
edge services second there is a lot of

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,550
innovation that's actually going to

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,490
happen there's lots of different

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,680
applications new services and we had

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,300
Intel are investing end-to-end I showed

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,320
you the product portfolio but even when

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,660
you look at sort of like across the

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,630
board from modern technology to radio

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,720
access network to edge to the network

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,250
core to cloud Intel sort of like looking

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,750
at this from an end to an optimization

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:32,520
standpoint and so my ass to you is I

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,160
would love to actually collaborate with

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,990
you spend the time here in Amsterdam at

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,480
the ONS talk a little bit more about

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,930
some of the things I talked about in

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,790
terms of the evolution of network

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,760
infrastructure with more of a cloud

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,230
native transformation and so the key

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,350
things that we can work together to

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,700
realize the full potential of 5g so

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,240
let's collaborate let's work together

00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:02,460
and drive the next set of innovation

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:06,789
cycle for 5g and network edge thank you

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,789
