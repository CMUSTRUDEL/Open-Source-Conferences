	Keynote: New Research on Embryonic Edge: Apps, Money, Momentum - Michael Howard, Senior Research Director, Carrier Networks, IHS/Infonetics Research

The industry is excited about opportunities for the network Edge—or more exact, the Edges. IHS Markit just completed interviewing a group of the industry’s top edge experts from operators, vendors, startups, and industry organizations. We define edge applications as those that run on edge compute located within 20 milliseconds of the end user, device or machine. We found the top 10 edge applications, the expected top revenue producers, and when each app will be deployed. Of course, the edge is not free and is not without problems to be solved—so we found which apps are most expensive to deploy and what are the problems the industry has yet in front of us to solve before the edge is fully upon us.
