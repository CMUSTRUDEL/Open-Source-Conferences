Description: 
	Keynote: New Research on Embryonic Edge: Apps, Money, Momentum - Michael Howard, Senior Research Director, Carrier Networks, IHS/Infonetics Research

The industry is excited about opportunities for the network Edge—or more exact, the Edges. IHS Markit just completed interviewing a group of the industry’s top edge experts from operators, vendors, startups, and industry organizations. We define edge applications as those that run on edge compute located within 20 milliseconds of the end user, device or machine. We found the top 10 edge applications, the expected top revenue producers, and when each app will be deployed. Of course, the edge is not free and is not without problems to be solved—so we found which apps are most expensive to deploy and what are the problems the industry has yet in front of us to solve before the edge is fully upon us.

About Michael Howard
Michael Howard co-founded market research firm Infonetics Research in 1990, and today is recognized worldwide as one of the industry’s leading experts in emerging markets, network operator trends, and user buying patterns. Infonetics was acquired by IHS Markit in 2014. Nicknamed the “Ethernet pope,” Michael leverages 40 years of communications industry experience to author research on carrier Ethernet, cloud access, software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), carrier routers and switches, mobile backhaul, OpenFlow, and packet-optical transport. Before founding Infonetics, Michael was an IT Director at Tymshare/Tymnet, where he created network accounting and led the First Interstate Bank project that developed the world's first pre-Internet in-home banking system. Prior to that, shortly after majoring in Mathematics at University of California Berkeley, Michael worked for Systems Development Corporation on operating systems and programming language compilers for ARPAnet, which later became the Internet

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
so thank you good morning so it's a

00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:08,010
exciting area topic edge what is the

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,500
edge as Harvard said everybody has a

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:16,170
slightly different definition

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,390
so Harvard and us got together to do

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,400
this research and you can't go out and

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:25,619
say what are all the edge applications

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,859
today in motion we talked to 14 experts

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,640
14 thought leaders in this space and got

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,790
their take on where edge is going or

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,200
more true I think would be to say that

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,649
edges everybody has a slightly different

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,989
take on it

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,110
so just quickly a lot of people know me

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,410
as from in phonetics research co-founder

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,649
but we're part of this big company IHS

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,680
market 50,000 customers worldwide 140

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,989
countries we really have a full spectrum

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,440
and in phonetics fits into the

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,619
technology group for we track components

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,080
materials the devices and equipment and

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,380
then the end markets and the Cape my

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,960
case has been telecom operators etc and

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,840
we have industry impact 127,000 publish

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,080
articles with our researcher analyst

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,470
quoted so what we do I call it the

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,680
embryonic edge there's a lot of edge

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:31,590
applications in motion already today but

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,290
what's coming where's the revenue

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,880
opportunities what does it cost what are

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,740
the impediments so we're going to touch

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:45,090
all that so we talked to thought leaders

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,220
from major telcos MSOs equipment

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,610
manufacturers chip manufacturers

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:55,259
startups some key startups open source

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:59,640
and spread around the world Asia North

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:05,369
America and in Europe we defined the

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:08,099
edge as a place where compute is located

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,830
that's what's in 20 milliseconds of the

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,310
end user device or computer or whatever

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,430
it is

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,410
accessing the network and so 20

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,940
milliseconds what does that look like so

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,980
if we look at a map if you will of a

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,280
network we have the edge on this side

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,600
and back and deep in the network where

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,030
the data centers are big data centers so

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:40,040
20 milliseconds actually here is from

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:45,500
the edge device to the CIO's anyway and

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:49,250
to some Metro I X's as well some not

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,970
though okay so that's where we define it

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:55,580
is so at the edge will certainly IOT

00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:00,170
gateways what's not an edge a big data

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:03,110
center what is an edge partial edge a

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,280
regional CEO or certainly I know in the

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:09,020
San Francisco Bay Area where I am

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,630
Equinix has that these six locations

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:16,730
around the Bay Area and in each one of

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:19,250
those there some a distributed data

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,220
center from Google from AWS Microsoft

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,820
etc so that's a partial edge I see

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,190
because within that 20 milliseconds you

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,110
can reach a lot of the population but

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,020
not all of it

00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:36,140
the CEO yes so the stats I'm showing you

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,640
here are from our big study we did last

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,980
year with operators around the world

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,530
that represents 61 percent of the

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,110
world's capex and they said that

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,380
where are they going to execute vnf so

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,170
that's one of the functions classically

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,970
targeted for edge compute so we see

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,520
ninety-seven percent of the operators at

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,890
some point are going to put vnf

00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,750
execution that is they'll have a smart

00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:03,530
CEO they'll have a data center small

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:07,730
data center in that CEO what's another

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,440
place well over 80 percent the operators

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,840
say they're on these new devices a

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,940
universal CPE

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,150
which I define as a little server that

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,960
has a Pico cloud in it sitting on a

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:23,840
enterprise location that's an edge to we

00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,860
do compute there easily and then in

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,289
homes as well

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,139
along soon that also certainly had his

00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:32,060
cell towers we talk about 5g but even 4G

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:36,289
there's a lot of applications here

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:40,849
already available are targeted anyway

00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:42,439
Emme see AI the IOT and certainly 5g

00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:45,830
when it gets there on the edge certainly

00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:50,599
includes that ce o--'s and some of the i

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:52,460
exes okay so now i'm going to talk to

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:56,979
you about some of the data that we got

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:59,150
from our interviews my colleague dr.

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,240
cliff grocer and i did all the

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,229
interviews we did him all alive took a

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,150
lot of notes and came up with

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:12,229
synthesizing this into some actionable

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:15,740
data for you so there's a lot of data

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:17,599
it's downloadable the files there so i'm

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,580
not going to go through all of it but i

00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:22,610
want to at least give you some of the

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,580
highlights so if we look at that top

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:29,569
five applications and this is by the

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,810
refer sent of respondents video content

00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:36,250
delivery and video associated

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,250
applications are prime number one and

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:45,319
cisco the DNI predicts that in 2021 that

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:49,300
eighty-two percent of the world's

00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:54,969
traffic will be video so videos a huge

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:57,409
important application or just the the

00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:02,479
bandwidth that's being used for video

00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:05,930
needs to be solved by putting content

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:10,159
delivery network incurring and some

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,310
other applications at the edge so you'd

00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:16,490
reduce the bandwidth obviously

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,770
autonomous vehicles or drones or fleet

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,219
management etc is the second one there

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,969
AR VR IOT who was mentioned by a lot of

00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:28,639
people especially Factory IOT so if we

00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:32,870
look at those iyx locations for google

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,660
etc is in a Bay Area for example but a

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,370
lot of other metros around the world

00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,820
they have access to part of the

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,530
population but they don't have access

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:46,640
actually from the edge they cannot

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:48,530
achieve the delay for a lot of edge

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,210
applications because they don't have the

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:58,970
locations that are close facilities

00:06:52,210 --> 00:07:03,170
okay so revenue so these thought leaders

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:05,210
thought that there's five edge

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,010
applications and let me say that our

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,030
edge applications each one of them is

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,580
actually a collection of applications

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:18,140
but so there's five that got the top

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:20,990
rating for revenue production and so

00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,930
some of them are consumer driven like

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,890
gaming and video CDN others the

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:30,290
enterprise driven revenue private LTE

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:32,960
industrial IOT supply chain management

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:36,320
etc there's some non revenue driven like

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,960
surveillance in smart cities as security

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,840
and safety as a driver or you know the

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,300
smart cities have their own reasons to

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,650
deploy welcoming environment for

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,450
businesses and for their citizens so

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,910
this is let me move along because I

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,490
don't have a lot of time I'm gonna be

00:07:52,910 --> 00:08:00,010
around and also you can always email

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,010
myself or cliff grocer with questions

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:07,130
the top cost technology sorry the top

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,640
hurdles are technology and high costs

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,350
pretty generic but how do you manage and

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,360
monitor and offer it and control

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,370
hundreds of thousands or tens of

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,350
thousands of edge applications big issue

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,020
AI is involved are going to be involved

00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,610
but AI needs to be trained you have to

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,530
have big data to train it but what do

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,760
you put out at the edge not big data you

00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:33,710
for an inference engine so big problem

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,599
is though there's no common API for

00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:39,800
developers to develop education so

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,140
there's a lot of experimentation to

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,230
figure out the business cases so here's

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,510
an interesting one where we have what

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,860
areas need to be invested in in order to

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,570
fully develop

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:56,870
the edge well we on a scale of one to

00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:01,220
seven we always in our methodology for

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:05,380
research take us six or seven as those

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:08,330
are critical those are really heavy

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:11,410
answers so what do we see oh look

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,150
there's 10 there's 10 errors that are

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:18,160
significant areas for investment to

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:22,090
fully achieve edge compute so just

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,800
fascinating so there were a number of

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,870
direct quotes from the people that we

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,360
interviewed some I'm going to start from

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,320
the very bottom there's a lot of good

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,220
ones here but cell site with e note bees

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,830
and 5g nice latency good location but

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,070
huge dollars to deploy everywhere and

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,470
you must have business cases next one

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,200
from the bottom on the right side the

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,510
CEOs are not designed to be data centers

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,250
there's a tremendous challenge for the

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,010
hundreds thousands tens of thousands

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,950
distributed edge cloud the

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,800
administration the management OSS VSS

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:05,450
connections distributed database there's

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:08,930
a lot of issues to solve and so the five

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:12,130
top takeaways the top five edge

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:15,950
applications for revenue industrial IOT

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:19,760
video CDN distributed and virtualized

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:25,160
mobile core and fixed access private LTE

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,500
and gaming and we noted that the ICPs

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,720
and OTT s have partial coverage with

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:33,410
distributed data centers in big metros

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:37,670
20 to 50 milliseconds to the end-user

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:41,480
devices but telcos can offer much closer

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,490
5 to 20 milliseconds talking to one

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,540
Operator this morning who you hear about

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:53,090
later this morning hear from their their

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:55,190
targets under 20 so so we learned that a

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:58,070
lot of the edge deployments are

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,130
justified first by cost savings and then

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,680
followed by less deploy

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,160
barring applications there a lot of

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:11,150
makes sense just like Sdn and NFV start

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,010
small learn about the operations the

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,990
business cases and the difficulties

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,590
involved before you start expanding

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,030
those edge applications a lot of the

00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,400
applications are going to be deployed

00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:26,870
sin and many of those are going to get

00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:32,090
enhanced over time as the edge expands

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:34,250
and then finally compute is complex the

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:37,280
entity have a lot of things that are

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:40,820
going to be placed at that edge compute

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,960
locations and FV m ec fixed mobile

00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:47,930
convergence and how do you manage the

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,840
wonder tens of tens of thousands of

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,140
locations you have a I am forints engine

00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:58,730
security distributed node data

00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:01,220
consistency a 15 year lifetime so

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,650
there's a lot to go on here some new

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,210
fresh data about what the revenue

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:08,630
bearing apps are of what the important

00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:10,520
apps are going to be and if you have any

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,700
questions please feel free to email

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,850
myself or cliff and we're happy to

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,620
answer them so and I'll be around

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,200
engaging conversations today and

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,889
tomorrow well thank you

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,889
