WebAssembly is a new programming language, allowing us to compile C/C++ or other statically typed languages and run them in the browser and Node.js. While languages like C/C++ support multi-threading, JavaScript is single-threaded and this raises the question of how WebAssembly will behave.

In this talk we will discuss the design of threads for WebAssembly, the implementation challenges in terms of security and we will see examples of how multithreading can be achieved using Web Workers.
