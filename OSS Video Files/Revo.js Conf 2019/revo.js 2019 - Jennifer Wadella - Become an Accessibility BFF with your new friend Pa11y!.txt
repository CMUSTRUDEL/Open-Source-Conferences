Like Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, Pa11y is an accessibility tester‚Äôs BFF. You already have a million issues on your plate, so how do you find a way to get started on accessibility testing? Pa11y to the rescue! Pa11y is a lightweight JS a11y testing tool with some serious ‚Äúit‚Äù factor.

This talk will explain what Pa11y does and does not cover, review examples of both command line and scripted usage, dive into the Pa11y web service and show how to best accessorize a Pa11y setup with your current testing process.

Bonus content: how to convince the rest of your team and business why accessibility is totally worth prioritizing and how getting started with low-hanging fruit can vastly glamorize your product. Now you can take on creating a more accessible product like S & B take on the Upper East Side.
