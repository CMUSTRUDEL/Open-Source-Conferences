We believe in change. We believe in proven principles. We believe in choosing the right tool for the job. Come, attend my presentation to get a glimpse at our journey from a monolithic architecture to one driven by Clean Architecture.

I will show you how a project changed over the course of a whole year from a monolith written on top of an Express.js structure, and in various plain and messy JavaScript standards, into a modular Clean Architecture driven design and architecture, and with TypeScript.

We will talk about modules, adopting TypeScript, extracting microservices from existing code, and of course TDD, unit testing, api testing.
