In this duo-talk, Kwinten Pisman and Dominic Elm are going to take us on a deep dive into how Angular transforms components into DOM elements.

We will see how we hooked into this process to be able to teach our own template syntax to Angular so we can make our own code more concise and start using some features/APIs we've always wanted.

Attendees will walk away with a deep understanding of the Angular compiler and learn an (experimental) way to hack their own syntax into it!
