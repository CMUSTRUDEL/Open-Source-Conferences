Have you ever felt like open source is too much of a hassle to get into? Ever felt like you do not know enough about programming yet to get into open source? What if I told you that you’re not alone in this thought but that this thought is a misrepresentation of the facts? Join me as we take a deep dive.

Both Junior, Intermediate and Senior developers and non-developers very often find themselves mulling over the idea of contributing to open source projects. A lot of the times this is because they might not know how to get started in contributing to open source. They either don’t believe that they are able to contribute or they think that only developers and people who are code gurus can actually contribute to open source. These are all misconceptions and the goal of this talk is to correct those misconceptions as well as give a clear outline about how to go about it for both developers and non-developers.

[Music]

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,900
[Applause]

00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:25,590
okay I'm super excited to be here today

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:28,019
but before I begin with this talk I just

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,189
I want to say a big thank you to all the

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,740
organizers could we please give the

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:38,640
organizers a round of applause thank you

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:41,460
very much we do take it for granted but

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,920
organizing community conferences are

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,590
quite difficult it takes a lot of work

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
and they've done an amazing job here I'm

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,350
really glad I was allowed to give this

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,480
last talk I hope I can do some really

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,620
nice things to make everyone happy so

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,300
before I begin let's let's make some

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,100
first first introduction questions how

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:08,130
many people actually do open source here

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,470
and don't lie to me okay that's quite a

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,830
few hands how many people would like to

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,750
do open source yeah okay that's more

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,840
like the response I was hoping

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,270
okay say hello in Finland we will see it

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,390
there there don't ask me why I moved to

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,369
Finland it's a long story

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,140
I'm Kenny Beaulieu mayor Steven that

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,060
should look very weird that's mostly

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,670
because I don't want people to pronounce

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,049
my name wrongly but I can tell you how

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,579
it's pronounced later on

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,030
I'm the front-end engineering team lead

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,399
at big custom in Finland I used to be a

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,899
developer advocate I'm an app convinient

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,329
community manager for Corps d'Afrique

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,070
Corps d'Afrique is a weekend intensive

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,460
software engineering boot camp that we

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,950
run for underrepresented folks in tech

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,979
to get more on the represented folks

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,130
into tech you can find me on Twitter the

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:06,630
expensive steal don't ask me about that

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,729
handle because I will tell you but an

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,800
important Cabot before you follow me

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,710
please take note that I tweet a lot

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,450
about diversity and inclusion

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,480
talk about having more women in tech

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,520
more black people in tech more LGBTQ in

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,650
tech so if you're not comfortable with

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:30,540
that probably do not follow me because I

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:33,030
post that kind of thank you I'm

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,370
also liberal so if you're conservative I

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,380
make a lot of jokes about that so have

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,630
that back of your mind but what are we

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,390
going to be talking about today we're

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,830
going to talk about what open source is

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,340
why we should all contribute to open

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,920
source and how easy it is to get started

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,740
open source so I know that last that

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,200
last point is debatable but it actually

00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:00,240
can be say what on earth is open source

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,060
this is the dictionary definition from

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,710
Oxford Dictionary denotes in software

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,270
for which the original source code is

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,430
made freely available and may be

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,370
redistributed to modified and that's

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,190
what Oxford says and I'm not really sure

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,290
how that applies it's technically

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,290
accurate in real life probably not so

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,420
much my next question would be how many

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,970
people here can say that all the tools

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,290
that they've used in their life as

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,140
software developers were actually

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,310
written by them yeah if you raise your

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,690
hand I was actually going to bring you

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:37,500
up here okay so why should you

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,120
contribute to open source walking on

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,100
freenode who knows freenode who's old

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,750
school yeah enough to know freenode okay

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,670
so there are a few hands yeah that's

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,560
good that's good so I I don't feel out

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,750
of place that's nice

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,940
we know walking on phenol helped me and

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,280
many of the skills I later use for my

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,800
studies in University and my actual job

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,720
I think working on open source projects

00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,970
helps me as much as it helps the project

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:05,280
this was us an interview and it was

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,650
given by Reata and she's a she by the

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,040
way so for those who actually think open

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,370
source is a all boys club now that's not

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,080
how it works and she said this why she

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,480
loves contributing to open source and I

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,880
can I can give my personal story the

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,580
first conference I spoke at with an

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,410
internal conference of a company that's

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,720
probably 10 times bigger than why I work

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,700
out today and how did I get there

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,400
I was working at a previous company and

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,130
we had an issue we needed to deal with

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,780
so I created a small tool and the reason

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,720
I created the tool was because I found

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,590
that a lot of people were also having

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,900
the same questions on Stack Overflow and

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,960
it was a really huge hit in Google so I

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,190
made this to it to be honest I consider

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,010
the tool to be

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,610
pardon my swearing but at that time it

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,130
did handle the use cases that we had so

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,380
for me this was important and someone

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,770
saw that and then invited me to actually

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,510
come and talk about how I built that -

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,130
what when my thought process is behind

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,440
it and that's how I actually got into

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,450
public speaking so there are a lot of

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,480
benefits that can come with contributing

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:18,180
to open source let's look at some of

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,450
these benefits improving existing skills

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,540
now I'm not going to lie to you open

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,910
source can be a pain in the ass who has

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,490
ever submitted code for pull requests

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:35,160
and got told that this code is actual

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:37,920
 no one oh one two three okay so

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,470
there are a couple of people now if you

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,150
had that and you think it's bad you

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,919
should go and look at what we say and

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,730
pull requests on some open source

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,890
repositories you'll be surprised now

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,620
it's not so straightforward but you can

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,450
improve a lot of your skills and this is

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,130
because you have a community of people

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,020
who are actually doing the same thing as

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,180
you it doesn't matter if you're a super

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,650
skilled or on the skilled I do not

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,880
personally believe that there's anything

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,730
like on the skill when it comes to

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,110
contributing to open source next you

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,960
make people who are interested in

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,820
similar things one of my closest female

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,500
friends at the moment is Jessica Jordan

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,960
I talk about her a lot because she's an

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,750
amazing black woman in tech and how I

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,910
met Jessica was when I found out she was

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,440
contributing to empathy as her dog she's

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,020
on The Learning Team of empathy yes and

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,270
that's how I met her and we have a lot

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,700
of similarities every time I go to a

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,860
conference she's like always next to me

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,450
we're not here together at this time but

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,700
most of the conference's I've spoken at

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,560
we usually go together an interesting

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,260
part is we became friends from that but

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,879
we now have a kind of born where myself

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,710
I increase we sit down

00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,439
over polls we're in different parts of

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,090
the world but we brainstorm about Forks

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,349
we talk about difficulties you might

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,270
have in the office you know we talk

00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:52,770
about challenges so you can actually

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,029
make genuine friends from open source

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,669
also find mentors and teach others this

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,639
is also something really interesting one

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,099
of my role models in open source is

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,699
Yehuda who know you who knows yet with a

00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:10,770
cut yeah okay awesome I started off in

00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,900
C++ and then moved to Ruby and Ruby on

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,849
Rails and he was like an idol

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,740
III was glossing through the code he

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:20,879
wrote I'm like how can someone be so

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,409
smart and then of course I learnt a lot

00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,349
of stuff from him I eventually got to

00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:27,779
meet you again due to open source so you

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:30,150
can find a lot of mentees and you can

00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,129
teach people as well some of some of the

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,560
times we always think that we don't know

00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,330
so much you know my knowledge is limited

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,430
trust me there's someone who doesn't

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,810
know as much as you do contributing to

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,699
open source and helping some and make

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,770
their first boo requests can actually be

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,409
you change in someone's engineering

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,949
career so that's also something to keep

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:51,659
in mind build public artifacts that help

00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,110
you grow and build a reputation and

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:57,180
career this is the I think this is also

00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,909
a very important benefit of open source

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,800
that we don't mention a lot but I think

00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,779
it's also very important you can get a

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,000
lot of disability from contributing to

00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,879
open source how many people use webpack

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,919
here ok

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:17,960
how many of you know Shawn locking ok

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,710
all right

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,830
who doesn't know Dan Abramov who doesn't

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,779
know Dan from the app so you see that

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,310
there's almost no hands ok there are

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,379
couple of hands one two that's that's

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,690
actually that's a good thing

00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,360
doing an open source can bring a lot of

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,690
disability to you it can also create a

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,070
situation where people actually know the

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,279
value you can bring to the organization

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,810
and I can say this personally when I was

00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,610
employed as an engineering lead at

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,670
because there I never did the technical

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,230
interview the CTO and on github found a

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,269
couple of projects I worked on and

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,110
basically said he wanted me on the team

00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,180
I never

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,620
technically interview day so it can

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,930
actually help you create the public

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,150
profile also and basically it stands

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,940
like some kind of reputation track for

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:10,920
you as well

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,390
and lastly learn people skills how many

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,570
people here we are headphones when they

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:21,720
need to write code come on don't lie

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:25,470
okay a few hands okay more hands all

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,030
right you can learn vital people skills

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,330
when you contribute to open source and

00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:32,250
why do I say this it's because and the

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,130
open source community we have different

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,480
kind of characters most recently I'm

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,760
pretty sure a lot of people must have

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,220
heard about the issues we have in the VR

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,470
community it's something I don't like to

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,510
talk about torture but it showed that we

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,480
do have a lot of different characters

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,370
what I took from that episode was that

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,990
it's important to have people skills

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,850
it's important to know how to address

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,950
issues this is something you can

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,660
actually get from open source you see I

00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,100
can tell you that when you keep on

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,980
hearing like oh that code is that

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,070
code is you automatically just you

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,210
generate some really strong shield and

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,130
you know how to take constructive

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,620
criticism you know how to actually

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:14,610
address yes in that sense so you can

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:18,660
have vital people skills by contributing

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,610
to the open source so how to get started

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,450
trust me it's not as complicated as you

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:28,860
think who would like to get their first

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,850
pull request approved today really no

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:37,380
one must contribute to open source

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:39,090
really ok few hand-in-hand alright who

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,760
things contributing to open source is

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,190
difficult be honest if you think

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,100
contributing to open source is difficult

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:49,160
ok that's a lot of hands and I'm going

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,260
to bust your bubble and tell you that

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,980
it's not as difficult as you think it's

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,710
way more difficult than you think

00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,170
no I'm just kidding in principle it can

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:05,370
be challenging but generally what you

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:07,200
need is a right entry how many people

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,860
are responsible for documentation if you

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,390
document your code and don't like

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,160
yourself come on like no one is going to

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:17,470
blame you but if you document to go just

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:20,140
signify let me see okay if you think the

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,750
state of documentation for a lot of

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:26,380
frameworks absolute let me see

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,210
your hand okay so that's quite a lot of

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,970
hands and that shows that there's a lot

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,130
of things you can actually do to help in

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,130
open source there's a misconception that

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,210
says you need to know how to code to

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,820
actually contribute to open source

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,800
that's actually a lie there are lots of

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,470
people who are not really experienced

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,880
coders who do an awesome job on open

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,380
source there are lots of people who are

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,750
experienced with us and they actually

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,190
their primary job on open source tools

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,210
are not actually about coding and I'm

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,020
going to show you one

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:57,700
so I'm quoting author and when he says

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,360
I've been renown for my work on

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,820
cocoapods who knows cocoapods your hands

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,800
okay if you were around the iOS field

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,200
this is something very common there for

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,000
them most but what most people don't

00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,130
know that I actually don't do any real

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,630
work on the cocoapod tools itself my

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,370
time on the project is mostly spent

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:19,020
doing things like documentation and

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:22,060
working on Brandi this is for Tom and

00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,520
you might know him now from Microsoft I

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,370
believe he's on the fifth team at the

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,200
moment but he became popular for

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,570
cocoapods and here he's saying that he

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,470
it was an actual code what he did the

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:37,750
most was documentation and branding

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,150
very similar to what shamrockin does for

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,040
web pack of course he also does code but

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,300
he does a lot of things in documentation

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,590
and branding and showing that so there

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,840
are lots of things you could actually do

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,670
in open-source there are a lot of

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,720
amazing women who contribute to open

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,890
source there's natalia on viola there

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,270
are lots of amazing people who also

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,920
contribute to open source and it's on

00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,200
both sides of the spectrum so if you're

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,210
a lady and you feel like open source is

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,830
a boys club I'm sorry to burst your

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,240
bubble but it's not at least it's no

00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,950
longer a boys club there are a lot of

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,700
amazing women being kick-ass and doing a

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:12,190
lot of amazing things there and yeah I

00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,350
like to tell people about my proudest

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,390
moment contributing to open source you

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,180
might be surprised it has nothing to do

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:22,150
with code I didn't write a line of code

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,870
at all my proudest moment was when I

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,440
landed in

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,650
Jas this was the 11 point 4.0 release

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,860
and my name was there it's nothing big

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,420
but for every chord I've written for

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,690
open source repositories or every

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,130
contribution I've made to a BBS exchange

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,770
right volunteers and open source

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:45,190
engineer this was my proudest moment why

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:49,290
it was a pain I was feeling and I fixed

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,290
it but others not to feel I'll show you

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:59,110
yeah that was my mood so what landed me

00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,300
there was this the auto attendant Eames

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,580
you the headers how many people actually

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,050
know that on the request object you

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,010
actually have this you do headers

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:11,250
authority and scheme yeah okay two hands

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,930
that basically shows you how much

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,030
problem this was if you needed to use it

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:20,380
it wasn't documented anywhere now we're

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:22,210
talking about no GS 11.4 we have gone

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,980
from zero point and we're eleven point

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,870
four and we don't have this so if you

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,850
think that some projects are too

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,620
advanced and there is nothing you can do

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,630
about it trust me the lot of things you

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,340
can do about it and this was one this is

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,260
I say this because I want you to know

00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,240
that you don't have to be an expert or

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:42,670
anything you can actually contribute to

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,380
open source yeah I saw a lot of faces

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,720
like that I was this was a bit tricky I

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,840
was like if I do that would I have that

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,840
Wow and I did see this race is so quite

00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,820
appropriate and this is another one this

00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,590
is on Christmas if you're in the grass

00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,420
cool if you use graphical you probably

00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:01,420
have seen this or have come around

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,610
Christmas and this also didn't involve

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,350
code this was me facing a challenge

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,380
discovering it wasn't documented and

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,370
actually going on to help make sure it

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,670
was there for others who would

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,490
eventually meet it so in general the

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:17,470
message I'm trying to give you today is

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,300
don't fret open source can be

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,090
challenging open source can be daunting

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:25,210
but it doesn't have to be as complicated

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:27,040
as we make it the fact that you see

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,990
someone who's super skilled and he

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,390
contributes to open source does not mean

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,940
you cannot do it everyone can actually

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:38,420
contribute to open source

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:42,590
yeah I think that's my wife definitely

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:44,510
my wife okay if you really intricate in

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,970
one contribution or even better if it's

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,430
your first before this continent and

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,730
feel free to meet me a lot of the

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:55,910
speakers here also are into open source

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,040
or they actually can direct you how to

00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,960
get started so I would really like that

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,640
we we take our time to contribute to

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,130
open source another important thing I

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,590
wanted to mention here is we should also

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,020
try to encourage people who maintain

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,330
open source packages now one thing I

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,740
encourage is contributing to open source

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,470
like I said it doesn't always have to be

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,020
code you could easily buy someone a

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,600
coffee every month a cup of coffee maybe

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,430
is five bucks that actually help someone

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,660
who's maintaining a package so this is

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,430
something that you can also do this

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,950
could be a way for you to contribute but

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,090
then again that's totally up to you so

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,250
if you want to get your first

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,340
contribution I have a ton of issues

00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,740
around both in react in view GS and but

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,920
yes there's a lot of stuff there you can

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,120
definitely get started and you can find

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,740
all this information over there

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,600
open-source tour guide how to contribute

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,330
there's a lot of information you can

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,550
also get from that point and if you feel

00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,110
challenged or you feel like you want to

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,020
do it but there are certain blockers

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,240
please feel free to send me DMS I'm

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,460
always open and willing to listen and

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,620
help as much as I can so feel free to

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,360
eat me out I'm not even the greatest

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,460
open-source contributor my open-source

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,560
contribution is mostly to a BBS exchange

00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,690
but please hit me up and I can try to

00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,780
help you out with whatever contribution

00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,740
you want to do and if you're interested

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,830
in ember.js

I recommend abadeer's as for beginners

00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,630
generally because the community there is

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,300
very helpful to get some people

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,370
contributing to open source they they

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,380
guide you and give you practical tips

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,970
that helps you in such a way that you

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,800
can take it to any other community and

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,680
