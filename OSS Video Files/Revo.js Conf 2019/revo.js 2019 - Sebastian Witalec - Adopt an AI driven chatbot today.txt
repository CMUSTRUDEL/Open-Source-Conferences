Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions: What do chatbots eat? Do chatbots have dreams? What are the usual chatbot challenges? If so, this talk is for you. We will answer all of the above questions and many more.

You will learn how to build a fully functioning chatbot in less than 10 minutes â€“ without a single IF statement â€“ and train it to understand human language. Then we will top it up with a quick AI training to make it understand human language.

[Music]

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:17,060
[Applause]

00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,619
how's it going all right so I'm gonna

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,210
take a selfie because I always forget

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:24,650
taking pictures when I go to the event

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:29,480
and it's my first event in make some

00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:31,849
noise excellent I think I'm gonna lose

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,920
the microphone that's all right this is

00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:36,860
going to be on Twitter so if you did

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,239
something embarrassing the world will

00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,750
know about it all right

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,210
so let's talk about the real stuff and

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,730
building chat box so the agenda for

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,820
today is as follows we will try to

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,880
answer a few questions first one is what

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,930
the chat would eat whether they have

00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:00,140
dreams it's a serious question why even

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,930
use chat BOTS and what are the usual

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,420
shot with challenges and we'll go and

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,890
build one that's pretty cool and I do

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,079
recommend to try at home

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,259
it doesn't hurt normally not many people

00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:14,630
die trying to build Charlie so first

00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:18,740
things first I want to chat about it

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,810
anyone care to guess it's pretty easy no

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,110
they don't need code they eat pizza

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:27,590
of course tripod are built by developers

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,120
therefore they eat pizza all right oh it

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,220
was good attempt though good attempt do

00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,950
chatbots have dreams yes or no quickly

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:39,310
of course they do what do they dream

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:43,330
about no they dream about electric sheep

00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:47,090
you know Blade Runner stuff all right

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,409
but more seriously like why do we even

00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,760
want to use chatbots

00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,549
right like why would you want to build

00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,619
one um and when I ask myself this

00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:58,250
question I look more about how we

00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:59,780
communicate right so the way I remember

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,490
when I was a kid if I wanted to talk to

00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,340
a friend or something I'll go knock at

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,979
the door and we would talk right but the

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,979
way we communicate actually changed so

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,810
now instead we will actually text each

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,700
other right like I've been at dinner

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,409
tables where I would be texting somebody

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,170
sitting right right next to me you know

00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:21,439
and and you're laughing but pretty much

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,569
how have you did that right so it's

00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,239
pretty serious and therefore a lot of

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:28,130
companies a lot of businesses they

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,460
should also adopt you

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,440
communicate with their user base to text

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,200
right because dub just basically makes

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,840
sense and you have a whole lot of

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,910
different benefits that go with it right

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,640
like you get into like a customer

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:47,750
service you can remove all the pain

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,430
points that come from call centers chat

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,140
pods really don't need food like they

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,080
can multiply very easily right they can

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,320
handle and scale and they can go 24/7

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,820
right which is pretty pretty awesome

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,700
they don't get bored and they they're

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,260
very good at hanging repetitive tasks so

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,330
you know like you work in a call center

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,550
and I asked you the same question like

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,620
ten thousand times you probably want to

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,960
hurt yourself right after a while the

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,550
chat mods they're super happy because if

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,120
they answer it for the 10,000th time

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,500
that means that they're doing a good job

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,550
the speed of communication is pretty

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,950
great too

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,810
and that actually also because they can

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,700
very easily connect with all your API

00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,530
right so even the best person in the

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,420
call center would still need to spend

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,730
some time in salesforce or whatever

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,440
other system that you would be using to

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,540
find out the answer while the chat will

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,100
just fire the quick query and then can

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,780
get back to the answers to the user

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,910
pretty great I have this slide twice

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,980
the slide was so nice I had to have it

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:50,690
twice but let's face it the real reason

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,580
all of you are here that would want to

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,860
actually build a chat but it's because

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:58,070
it's fun to build one that's it's like

00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:02,360
the gold represent me building chat was

00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,950
like what else do you want from life so

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,030
what are the usual challenges that we

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,590
are facing falling down you see this is

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,630
why my talk should be done through a

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,680
chat pod like next time I'm definitely

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:18,730
gonna do that all right yeah oh now I'm

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,390
loud loud and clear Houston you hear me

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:26,180
alright I'll just stay like this see I

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,940
have unusual ears like they just don't

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,480
work first of does does the basically

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,490
the conclusion of my talk alright so the

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,770
usual challenges so I wanted to build a

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,570
childhood for a long while and I'd be

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,460
trying different technologies I'm not

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,010
gonna name them no naming or shaming

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,000
today just you

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,380
and then one of the first things that I

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,480
noticed that a lot of chat was were

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,570
doing especially those like DIY ones

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,760
where they had like fixed decision trees

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,770
what I mean by that is that the chat was

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,690
expected to you to do something in

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,520
specific order and if you did something

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,770
out of order it just didn't work so

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,500
here's one childhood conversation that I

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,860
had somebody goes like hey I want to

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,840
book a flight to London for Wednesday I

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,350
can help you book a flight so far so

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,920
good

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:15,410
what do you want to go I mean I just

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,460
told you but fair enough let's say

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:21,440
London when on Wednesday so I didn't get

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,780
that all right I'm gonna give you a day

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,450
and it's just kind of getting tiring so

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,490
what's really happening here is the chat

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,920
BOTS had like first step let me identify

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,720
the conversation oh you wanna fly

00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,780
somewhere okay now let me ask you four

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,520
for when and for where right this is the

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,470
problem child should be able to get all

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,030
the information and let you drive the

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:46,040
conversation how many so lack of

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,450
understanding of business entities so if

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,700
you're building a chat board for a

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,020
hospital for an office for a pizza

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,120
restaurant we will do that in a moment

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,430
the chat would should be able to

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,440
understand those entities right so if

00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,810
this is a childhood for a hospital it

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,880
should know what doctors are in that

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,950
hospital right so if I say something

00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:09,500
like I want to me I want to meet with

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:10,520
dr. Burke on Tuesday sure I can help you

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,520
book an appointment

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:20,380
what is your doctor's name what what

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,380
time would you like to see doctor what

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,240
what is going up I'm not sure I

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,210
understand you me neither

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,430
well actually this is not going anywhere

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,380
right the chat board should understand

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,419
that dr. Burke is one of the doctors in

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,330
this hospital right and not asks any

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:41,419
questions after so the real solution

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,190
should be I wanna see dr. Burke the

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,470
child should be able to link it to your

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,840
back-end and understand that dr. Burke

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,820
actually correlates to a record in your

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,800
database and then automatically should

00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,360
be able to know when it's available with

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,889
its speciality and all sort of things

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,840
like that

00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,750
so now when we have this conversation I

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,500
wanna see dr. Burke sure what time would

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,169
you like to meet dr. Burke right next

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,780
one is lack of proper acknowledgement so

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,759
the whole thing is that whenever I give

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,500
you some extra information or a lot of

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,270
information the childhood should

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,680
acknowledge done right if I ask you for

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,659
one question and just give me an answer

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,479
it's okay but if I give you loads of

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:23,539
information the child sugar acknowledge

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,580
it so here's one hi I would like to sign

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:28,190
up for health insurance for a surfing

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:32,060
trip to Timmy's awara from June 9th to

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:35,949
June 14th nothing weird here okay and

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,949
the chapel is like what's your age

00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:43,219
did you understand that I wanna do you

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,590
know TV sawara self painting I don't

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:48,139
know I don't know the proper solution to

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,870
that should be I wanna go for a surfing

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:53,569
trip to Timmy sawara June 9 2014

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,300
and the chapel should respond with a

00:07:53,569 --> 00:08:01,190
surfing trip to team Samar Timisoara is

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:03,050
always a good idea why not let's add a

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,479
surfer and let's find you an insurance

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,909
for this specific date so not only did

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,800
it acknowledge but all also provided

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:12,169
like more detailed dates on what you

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,819
would want to go to kind of feel more

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:16,550
comfortable so now when it's asking for

00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,139
your age that means that the next

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,860
question that is relevant to this whole

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:23,840
conversation next dealing with

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,990
ambiguities or not dealing with them

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,310
right so English actually believe that

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,349
English is like one of the most

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,329
ambiguous languages I ever heard it is

00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:34,610
like this so easy to say something that

00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:36,860
would be could be easily interpreted as

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,810
five different things and like I speak

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,529
polish that's much more accurate

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,909
language and yet there's still loads of

00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,709
ambiguities and it's very easy

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,050
especially for a childhood and natural

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:50,420
language processing to confuse about the

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,850
information so you have a very simple

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,490
scenario like this I talked to dr. Burke

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:59,089
he told me to book an appointment with

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,620
dr. Alcott right and for some reason the

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,910
child would think that well the finest

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,260
doctor you mentioned you probably want

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,570
to see that guy right like no no no I

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,940
want to see dr. Atkins right so what

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,530
happen

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,810
when the chat was here's of two doctors

00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,580
and needs to deal with them it should

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,800
give you an opportunity to kind of like

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,570
correct it right like I'm confused like

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,510
I'm gonna ask you questions like this I

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,010
am an intelligent being so I don't know

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,810
I talked to dr. Burke

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,000
he told me to see dr. Abbott alright

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,860
let's deal with them can you please

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,520
clarify which doctor do you wanna see

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,200
right and now yeah it's not perfect that

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,090
he didn't get straight away but at least

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,020
gives me an option I can choose dr.

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:42,720
output and we can car carrier lack of

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,940
long-term memory so we're dealing with

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,650
machines connected to database and

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,340
everything it should remember the stuff

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,200
that we providing right so if I do stuff

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,720
like booking an appointment every

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,520
Tuesday right dr. Burke on Tuesday at

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,960
11:00 perfect

00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,930
absolutely let's book you the

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,880
appointment what is your phone number

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,310
see the weird thing here is that if I

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,900
went to this conversation every week why

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,030
is they still asking me for that right

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,640
like don't you have it already right

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,920
the proper thing is we should be able to

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,960
train a child to remember certain big

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,880
pieces of information so if you'd keep

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,310
telling me you wanna see this doctor

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,520
these times and I need your phone number

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:26,070
I can provide and say like hey is this

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,540
your phone number and I get an option to

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,790
acknowledge it or change it

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,310
anyone could to guess whose phone number

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:36,660
this is it's somebody very important in

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:38,610
the UK it's Boris Johnson very well you

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,240
wanna give him a call you go ahead

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,830
that's his phone number

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,230
good job good job

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,390
before he was two resumes phone number

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,750
so obviously she changed it that's why

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:54,480
there is an option for no easy next one

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,910
lack of conversation UI so we're talking

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,370
about chatbots and having text text text

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,730
but we should be able to aid the user

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,290
throughout the conversation right so

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,710
again we book in a lot of appointments

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,230
today dr. Perricone to use them I

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,950
understand how you want to see dr. Burke

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:16,589
what time anything wrong with this well

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,900
what's wrong with this is what I'm

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,980
saying I want to see him at 12 but he's

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,740
busy at work

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,870
right sorry what time

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,460
this is you know this is going to take a

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:33,720
while for you to guess when he's

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:35,550
available or she actually is John so the

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,380
proper way of dealing with it is I want

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,930
to see dr. Berg on Tuesday I know which

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,260
doctor I know Tuesday lets me look let

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:46,230
me look up when he's available and

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:49,380
provide available option for now me as a

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:53,510
user I can choose 11 or 15 or 15 30

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,770
right and that's making a lot simpler so

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,050
these are like actually quite common

00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,820
challenges so it should be pretty easy

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,750
to build your own chart but from scratch

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:06,000
right well so that was like two years

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,670
ago three years ago I'm fuzzy on the

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,010
dates we had a hackathon of progress for

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,360
like a two days and one of the teams

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,620
decided to build a chat bot from scratch

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,960
that was basically a virtual assistant

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,760
that would allow you to book meeting

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,070
rooms right we have meeting rooms like

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,990
in Sydney in Boston in Sofia like lots

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,480
of different places should be pretty

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,550
simple right I mean you just want to say

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,100
where you want at for how many people do

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,930
you want a TV or a projector or or be

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,270
able to make external calls or sort of

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,010
thing right but like our developers like

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,860
they were ready to go and build it you

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:44,400
know like super excited the source code

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,790
was coming down and then the designers

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,080
came in and we came up this this is

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:52,260
literally a picture of our first

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,180
decision tree for this visual system so

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,700
imagine now writing all these state

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,370
if-else statements to kind of follow the

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,560
whole tree like I don't have to tell you

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,840
much but basically we did about 10% of

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,700
that in the inner two days and then

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,310
changing anything after was a completely

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,350
complete disaster so basically the

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,350
outcome after 48 hours was this

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:32,800
yeah we had to find new developers and a

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:34,690
new cut um so as a result we actually

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,180
decided to create an engine that could

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:41,260
enable us to do this like we based it on

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,180
like creating chat pods with pure code

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,480
logic just wouldn't make sense it just

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,269
wouldn't work so we created a chat with

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,690
all the that use the clarity of language

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:55,089
to construct a conversation or do what

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,790
we want to do so basically instead of

00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:00,220
telling specific steps of how he has to

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,800
perform we kind of tell him hey if

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,850
somebody says this I want that probably

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,279
means that they want to do this

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,380
conversation and that means that we need

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,209
to ask them for these pieces of data so

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,220
we declare what we want to extract from

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:14,350
the user and the chat bot controls the

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,170
flow that's a pretty cool thing so

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,329
here's an example of me declaring a step

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:23,110
I have this conversation when I want to

00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:25,589
ask a question right then I would say

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,600
well the question would be of type

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,850
country and then entities based like a

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,459
name of a variable okay so far so good

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,050
we have four different countries next

00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:37,660
there is a message so there's like a

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,329
prompt on how do I ask the user for

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,160
which country they want and then finally

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,990
we can also add some addition aid in

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,269
terms of height should I display the

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,050
list of countries to the user or let's

00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,459
use the free text and just that

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:55,600
resulting conversation that can perform

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:57,490
this I want to order a car well could

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,320
curanto which country want to go and you

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,110
have those options of the countries

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,230
popping up just that it's I think it's

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,209
pretty awful and the best thing is that

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,060
all of that pretty much works with

00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:13,570
messenger viber like any website you can

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,670
just drop it beat angular react like

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,640
pure JavaScript just work you can also

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,370
drop it in a native mobile applications

00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:23,350
native script we actually just added

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,180
Alexa so it's not coming soon anymore

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,699
but we are thinking and working on

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,069
what's up so those will be others but

00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:31,880
basically with one coat you can cover

00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:37,440
those platform

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:39,720
so it's time to build a demo so I'm a

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,150
bit crazy I love doing live coding I

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,800
don't know why people fear live coding I

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:48,660
mean there's so many crazy things that

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,690
can go wrong and if we don't leave for

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,640
the Hat what do we leave for it right

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,860
okay so basically the whole conversation

00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,240
at the moment we're building by

00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,250
constructing in JSON

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,260
right and there's loads of code snippets

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,660
that help me do it so I can say I'm

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:10,290
gonna do a conversation of that goal and

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:13,170
I will call it order pizza okay and then

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:22,710
I can do the step message just to test

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:27,270
that everything worked right so in a

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,890
training I have to train the chat bot to

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,340
understand when to trigger this

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:34,170
conversation right so I want us all call

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:43,220
this order pizza conversation when

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:43,220
somebody says I am hungry I want a it's

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:52,350
because reasons right and I can already

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:54,630
test this in like there's like a console

00:16:52,350 --> 00:17:02,310
that allows me to test stuff and I can

00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:06,750
say I and then respond with hello TV

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:12,750
Sora so we have some sort of logic let's

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:16,680
see if understand if I say I hungry yes

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:19,680
the response he thought 84% was that was

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,579
the accuracy so pretty good pretty good

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,470
okay so we are on a way to go so all

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,760
right so in order to order pizza we

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,910
should be able to ask a couple of things

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,400
like what's the size and what type of

00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,200
pizza we want so we need to train in

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,350
with type of entities right so we'll

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,140
have one entity called size and I'll

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,870
just create a static list so I will list

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,710
them basically just saying there should

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,710
be a small pizza

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,120
there should be a medium pizza

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,860
alright and there should be large

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,540
ecstatic least work well they're short

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,260
and you know you're not changing them

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:05,220
too often I could also make it like

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:08,070
18-inch an alias so if I say either the

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,970
actual name or all the size and inches

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:15,270
now that both them would work right okay

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:19,170
so we have size let's also add a pizza

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:21,690
so just half an hour ago I built this

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:24,120
back-end that returns a list of pizzas

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:28,650
so you can see I have like a name price

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:31,200
image and type so I am going to train my

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,340
childhood to get that data so okay I'll

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:39,000
load it dynamically from this URL and

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:41,570
the value is basically the name property

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,120
so I will be training and I can test it

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,130
talk to train the chapel so that they

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,770
understand that when I say ham pepperoni

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,500
or meat or veggie that means that I'm

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:55,830
talking about pizza right so let's press

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,890
create so now I have two additional

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,840
types the chart was very cooling quickly

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,480
retrain itself and I can even test it

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,480
here like say a you run

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,090
and this is just purely for testing and

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,450
NLP natural language processing so you

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:29,580
see he recognizes medium and large sizes

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:32,520
and meet us pizza so good alright so

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:36,150
let's go back to our cognitive flow when

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,130
I train my childhood to ask questions

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,800
right now we start with the user

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:45,270
interrogation or some people call it

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,040
just conversation so first a question so

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:51,210
we'll be asking for sites with the

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:56,460
variable name size the type is size what

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:58,740
is the I would just say what size right

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:04,519
like short and easy

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:08,070
and then our also add display of type

00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:12,029
quick reply nice so we have one step

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:15,210
let's do another step question and this

00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:23,399
time we'll get a pizza all the pizza

00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:29,820
pizza which pizza would you like and

00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:33,299
then again display type click reply all

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:36,110
right let's let's test this childhood um

00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:38,999
the thing is I also have this chat bot

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,940
there's like beats where I can publish

00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:45,179
it to like Facebook to Alexa and other

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:48,779
other devices so I have actually a

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:52,350
messenger here let's make it bigger and

00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:55,110
I can I already did I save it let's make

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,749
sure I probably eat all right where I

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,940
was so I can already in real messenger

00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:06,409
if you actually go to this URL you can

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:10,850
test it yourself I can say I am hungry

00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:10,850
what size

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:19,580
hey light coding what can go wrong if

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,700
you large which pizza let's see what

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,519
other pizza are there okay let's go with

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:33,470
taco pizza because that basically makes

00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:35,960
sense anyway basically that was me

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,630
already testing it in messenger and that

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,149
works pretty nicely we can do all sort

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,279
of things like I can display the options

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:45,440
as a carousel like with images and

00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,480
things like that or maybe instead of

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:58,840
talking about it I could maybe do it

00:21:47,480 --> 00:22:04,130
alright say data source

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:05,929
okay what do we have here an endpoint so

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,700
load it because we can provide specific

00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:09,470
queries like if you wanna just show

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:31,549
veggie pizzas or something else that's

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:33,500
pretty doable button text template so in

00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:36,889
the template we're basically telling

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:40,370
like the title so I'm using like double

00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:42,580
handlebar to specifically full field so

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:47,269
I want to display as a file to the name

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:53,690
I think I have a subtitle so I can do

00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:57,409
for example pizza dot price oh that

00:22:53,690 --> 00:23:03,549
should be in the double handle bar and I

00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:03,549
think it was an image it was Oh

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:15,740
now might be too fuzzy what is it I

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:20,130
don't think I need this slowly

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:30,120
all right let's try it if I test it here

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:33,000
I want a large pizza I should work

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,400
should automatically understand and you

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,110
see we have a nice carousel like shown

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,400
all the pizzas like how cool is that I

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:43,500
can press select and go to pepperoni but

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,110
since I chose the size it didn't really

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,600
acknowledge the fact that I wanted a

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:52,320
large pizza ok so let's let me fix this

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,510
so what I can do is I'll try a couple of

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,270
things so we have this thing called

00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,549
reactions so what the first one is on

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:03,980
the sides we have acknowledged so you

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:07,740
can say I see you like your pizza and

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:11,130
then I can say sighs right and basically

00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:15,419
don't put put it in there I can also

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:21,480
have another one which is suggestions so

00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:25,909
this one is usually usually you have

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:28,740
your sides

00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:30,809
okay so this is where Chatwood can

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,110
actually learn from you about your

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:36,919
previous preferences ok so let's test

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:45,950
that so from now on it starts learning

00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:49,740
so I am hungry I'm gonna choose small

00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:55,350
and I'm gonna go with ham pizza cool

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:58,140
again I want a pizza this time small is

00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:01,049
the first option right it's learning all

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:09,630
right let's go small this time on a

00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:12,240
pepperoni okay I am hungry usually half

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,730
your pizza small it is like it's helping

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,309
us so I can say yes and we can keep

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,620
going and everybody's happy and this

00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,120
time we'll go meet and then finally I

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:28,050
can say I am

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:31,500
hungry for a large pizza see that works

00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,820
I see you like your pizza large so there

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,330
you go you have that acknowledgement

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:40,980
it's pretty cool okay so what we need to

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:42,570
basically do next is maybe half I'm

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,940
gonna remove the Carozza because I want

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:49,220
to show you how how this whole thing

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:51,360
works with an Alexa device and usually

00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,190
you won't be able to actually see the

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,950
images here because the screen is small

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:58,590
anyway you know what I mean so quick

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,950
reply that should do it for the pizza

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:08,790
let's ask one more question like step

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:16,680
question location that's a text like we

00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:21,110
can ask where should I send it to let's

00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,110
do another question like confirmation

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,010
that wasn't me I thought that thing

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:49,500
wasn't me

00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:55,950
so we can say so so basically you're

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:59,490
about to order a size pizza to location

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:02,730
right so this will be that in there is

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,920
that correct and they'll be like a yes

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,050
or no question and then finally we want

00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,510
to save it somewhere like make an order

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:13,140
or something right so I created this API

00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:17,790
which is like a basket so what I can do

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:23,130
is something like this so currently I'm

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:25,050
gonna make a web hook call and what this

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:29,280
will do is basically something like that

00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:34,740
so I have my sample basket I'll call it

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:38,460
pizza so does the idea of the basket

00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:44,399
and then add the name of the item that I

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:48,990
want to add is pizza and we probably

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:53,610
also need to add price so each pizza

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:57,960
item actually contains a pizza price

00:27:53,610 --> 00:28:01,590
entity so I think this should work so

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:07,139
let's test it here before I trust a try

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:13,139
it on Alexa so final demo on here I want

00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:13,940
a large pizza cool let's go with

00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:23,220
margarita

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:25,110
why should I send it revenue there you

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,059
go you're about to order a large

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,659
margarita to Revelator's venue is that

00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:38,249
correct

00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:42,869
yes and now we send a query getting

00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:46,740
nervous so I have my basket that was

00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:49,379
pizza there you go so margarita is in my

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,119
basket now I think somebody else was

00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:53,850
using my API in the mean time and order

00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,639
a meat pizza like hey why not all right

00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:59,700
let's do a demo with Alexa so what I

00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:01,889
have is you could test it directly here

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:05,340
from like Alexa developer console but I

00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:10,460
also connected my sample that up into us

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,460
actual skill so we are going to do it

00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:19,669
[Music]

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:19,669
right Alexa asks sample to order a pizza

00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:34,009
what size large medium small medium I am

00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:40,710
Not sure I understood what you said

00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:45,210
Alexa that small I am Not sure I

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:49,820
understand what you said what size large

00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,820
Alexa medium large

00:29:51,990 --> 00:30:00,130
lark I'm not sure I understood what you

00:29:55,149 --> 00:30:04,899
said what size large alexa median

00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:07,809
restart I will do it one more time your

00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:14,100

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:44,350
our conversation by talking restart here

00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:53,620
is what I can do for you suspicious

00:30:44,350 --> 00:31:00,730
transaction clearly Alexa doesn't know

00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:03,309
what team sawara Alexa continue if you

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:08,370
get stuck you can always restart our

00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:08,370
conversation by typing restart Alexa you

00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:17,139
get stuck you can always restart our

00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:22,210
conversation right Alexa start listen to

sure but go home you're drunk anyway

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:40,829
[Applause]

00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,220
all right all right this is what's gonna

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,900
happen

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:52,610
ah um there's many reasons to blame for

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,430
that it's so many reasons to play for

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,680
you um this is not the Washington happen

00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,750
to me I was running a live webinar once

00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,900
and I was trying to tell Alexa that I

00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:06,650
want to top up my phone and the response

00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:09,190
was like ask for a fart watch I didn't

00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,190
say that

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:16,640
you know that's part of the game that's

00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:19,550
part of the game all right continue so

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:30,140
what do you think is that cool or not do

00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:32,120
i yes yeah so what to where to go next

00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,880
you can take a picture of that I'll tell

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,580
you one there's a website where you can

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,040
learn about what actually the Kimbe

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,960
chart is there's even a tutorial that I

00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,810
