💻 The Talk(s)

1) Fighting COVID-19: How ZOE went from idea to 1 million users in less than a week with React Native - by Julien (https://twitter.com/julienlavigne) and Mike (https://twitter.com/isofarro)

ZOE is the healthcare startup behind the COVID Symptom Tracker, an app helping scientists and authorities understand the symptoms and spread of the virus. More than 3M people participated in this citizen science project, leading to the publication of several research papers and discoveries at https://covid.joinzoe.com/blog.

The COVID Symptom Tracker is the first React Native app released by the ZOE engineering team. In this talk, they will share their experience adopting RN, the challenges they faced and whether they believe this choice was the right one in this context.


2) Unifying React Native Across All Platforms - by Peter Piekarczyk (https://twitter.com/peterpme)

When React Native first came out it was primarily meant as a way to build mobile apps using React. Since those humble beginnings, the React Native ecosystem has exploded and supports much more than just mobile. From the Xbox, to the desktop, to the web: there's a React Native experience for you. 

In this talk I will go over the exciting developments 2020 has brought that makes this easier and go over the different platforms you can target with React Native. I will also share case studies for companies that have successfully made this work!

hello and welcome to the second digital

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,050
reacts native London meetup so this is

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,040
the May edition of our Meetup

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,000
and thank you as always to push it for

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,069
recording this for us it would be

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,830
possible for these digital meetup to

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,180
happen without them and so briefly I'll

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,569
just run through their format of this

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,120
evening we've got um two talks and we'll

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,130
have live Q&A and discussions afterwards

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,660
we got all bitter delayed but if you put

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,200
any questions in the chat we'll be able

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,930
to ask them to the speakers and the

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,090
first talk we have is with Julien and

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,470
Mike and they're talking about how they

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:35,330
built a covert tracking app Zoey and

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,460
it's about how they went from kind of

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,110
learning react native to in production

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,419
with 1 million users in less than a week

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,700
which is a no mean feat and not

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:45,800
something I want to try my cell and so

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,150
I'll be here at their journey and let's

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,950
not have got any questions for them and

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,560
then we'll be hearing from Peter who

00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,080
will be talking about unifying react

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,600
native so originally react native was

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,190
just unifying maybe android/ios but now

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,140
we see it across so many different

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,760
platforms I'll be talking about some of

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,490
the recent developments and how that's

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,970
enabled us to spread even across even

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,470
more platforms so I'm look forward to

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,050
these two great talks this evening and

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,860
without any further ado let's get into

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,860
the first talk

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:25,120
[Music]

00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,520
hi everyone today I want to talk about

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,370
the Kovac symptom study app and

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,319
especially how at zuy we went from

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,319
having very little experience of react

00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,199
negative to shipping an app used by more

00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,710
than 1 billion people in about these

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:44,770
days so this talk is really a case study

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,360
we not expert in react native but we

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,759
want to share with you our journey what

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,009
we learned what worked well and why we

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,659
think that ultimately that was a good

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:56,860
decision for us to build that up with

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:59,830
react native so Who am I my name is

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,159
Julien and VP of engineering at Zoe and

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,169
my co-speaker today will be Mike Davis

00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:07,659
Mike will join us for the Q&A but I will

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,819
do the talk myself and Mike is a

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:14,229
software engineer does one one of the

00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:18,219
main person behind VI your app so I'm

00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:23,409
Zoe before working in a given symptom

00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:26,229
study app we are after all a nutritional

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:27,940
science company and basically we're in a

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,969
mission to try to help people to hit

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,089
with confidence and the tropic you can

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:35,889
see here is very interesting because for

00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:38,650
the last two years we've basically done

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:40,719
a lot of nutritional study and one thing

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,490
we found out is that all of us were

00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:45,370
spawned very very differently to food

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,319
and so in that case we're measuring the

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,819
blood sugar response which is the level

00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,610
of sugar you have in your blood after

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:53,439
eating a meal and you can see there is

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,029
almost like a hate fold difference

00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,719
between the people at the bottom and the

00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:01,569
people at the very top and so that's the

00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:04,960
core of what zoe has been building for

00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:08,409
the last couple of years and so formally

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,729
we believe that food is the most

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:14,589
important important medicine we take and

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:17,620
we're building a product around that

00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:21,550
that should be relatable to people later

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,150
in the year and we also basically the

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,589
world a just attritional science program

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,300
about measuring respond to food and

00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,770
we've been working with a lot of people

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,300
and

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:34,210
that is actually quite relevant for the

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,860
work we did very simply with the common

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,650
symptoms that yeah so I've been working

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,960
with people with from KCl Harvard

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:46,539
Stanford massage reception General

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:50,169
Hospital's and twins yukia so that

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:54,159
brings me to the covet symptom study app

00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:56,650
so for all you that never heard of it

00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:59,229
it's an app that was released about two

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,530
months ago primarily in the UK and the

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:05,770
u.s. intense we don't and principal are

00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,169
very very simple we ask you to report

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,539
your symptoms on a daily basis and

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,009
whether you're feeling well or in the

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,020
world and if you're feeling unwell we

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,180
ask you quite a lot of questions about

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,580
what kind of symptoms you have are you

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,680
coughing do you have fever if do you

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,080
have a hoarse voice have you lost the

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,969
sense of smell and basically that

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,620
information is collected and we've got a

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:32,349
lot of people are participating in this

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,870
science project basically so this

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,880
information is collected and then sent

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,829
for analysis both by teams and Tumulty

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,469
so we'd also teams at kacl

00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:43,329
MGH another University another

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,310
information is also now disseminated to

00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:48,520
the government to the authorities to the

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:52,420
NHS and there has been extremely useful

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,860
for understanding better the coughing

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,959
symptoms and we made some very

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,430
interesting discoveries about what are

00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,750
the symptoms that predict whether you

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:03,220
have Cove it or not but also just

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,520
understanding that the spread of the

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,760
virus this project basically all started

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,760
as I said that two months ago and team

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,089
Inspector which is also one of the

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,940
founders of zoe is professor of genetics

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:22,329
of genetic epidemiology at King's

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:25,570
College and working for something called

00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:26,279
twins UK and twins UK is actually the

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,399
biggest

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,350
database of twins in the UK twins are

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,200
quite interesting because basically they

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,940
want you to analyze genetic factors so

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,390
you can compare up people you know how

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,339
twins

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,990
react

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,050
different things and in our case we're

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,689
working with him on the nutrition side

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,990
of things so about two months ago

00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:50,639
basically reached out to us and since

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,860
twins UK was going to be shut down for

00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,499
lockdown started to ask us

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,220
could you build an app for us for

00:09:55,499 --> 00:10:00,930
understanding epic better our coven 19

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:04,439
you know works and and we could use

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:07,649
between registry as a way to learn

00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:09,990
something very very specific about about

00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,610
comment that other people could could

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,610
not do so

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,589
yeah sure we would really love to help

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,170
we're like everybody else in the same

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,120
boat with covenant so if there is

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,759
something we can do you know let's try

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,350
to do that great and then Tim asked us

00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,889
to do could I have this app you know

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,290
literally tomorrow evening which you

00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:34,499
know say ok let's let's let's give it a

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,240
try so obviously generally you would

00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:37,370
take in a weeks or months is to build an

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,410
app like that

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,029
but we've covered 19 you know we don't

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,389
have that time so we really need to

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:46,920
really needed to to feel something

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:49,709
extremely quickly and that's basically

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,509
how this project started and this

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,999
project that started me surely with just

00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:57,569
building in that for the 15,000 people

00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:59,370
or twin rich history quickly became well

00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:01,589
actually this app could work for

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,389
everybody so we should release it to the

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,569
general public and you know if there is

00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:09,149
an uptake great if there is not then you

00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:11,929
know that's not too bad we've tried so

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,399
we've assembled the team at that point

00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:17,670
which was you know kind of a Katherine

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,339
style we had to react native engineers

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,939
for him fronting or kind of because one

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,319
of those was myself and I'm actually

00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:27,600
have not been writing a lot of code for

00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:30,509
last few years and certainly have not

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,509
been writing any mobile apps to back and

00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:35,279
engineers both working on the actual

00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:38,309
code for the back end but infrastructure

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,929
to run run it one product designer is

00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:42,300
coming up with all the design for the

00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:44,730
screen and thinking about the flow and

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,339
our CEO or traffic wolf was also very

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,410
involved both in the flow but also in

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,420
occurring all the legal aspect and which

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,600
are very complicated for a

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,120
like that so we have symbol LED team on

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,970
the 19th of March which was basically

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:05,180
when we've discussed this idea with team

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:08,600
and KCl and we started at lunchtime and

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:12,270
as I said the goal was to have enough

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,310
working literally in 36 hours later one

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,780
of the reason we wanted to go fast is as

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,640
I said because you know covered 19

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,950
cannot wait also because we were

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,510
anticipating that getting it through the

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:26,130
store review process would be and that

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:29,150
been difficult so in about 56 hour we

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,220
actually had the first app I think we've

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:35,880
pushed it towards midnight on the Friday

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,310
night and we you know went through the

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,020
store submission process and quickly we

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,000
find out that I know Google and Apple

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,510
were also in a bad situation we've come

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,150
in 19 and therefore you know the time

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:51,570
they needed to review was upwards of one

00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,890
week so that didn't work for us so we

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,570
actually spend a lot of time during the

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:57,540
weekend normally you know adding

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,760
features but also reaching out on a

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,670
network and trying to get through the

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,430
approval process especially everything

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,170
covered 19 related is quite control and

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,990
those platform with you know good

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:13,770
reasons so you know we had to do quite a

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,170
lot paperwork with KCl to prove to them

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:19,980
that this project was actually you know

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:22,770
a real research project with I think

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,860
approval which is needed for any kind of

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:28,380
service research and basically on the

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,680
Monday we finally got our approval and

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,560
we're ready to launch next day so next

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,600
day we've launched at about 9:00 a.m.

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:40,170
mostly by team reaching out his network

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,510
and tweeting and the thing just valuing

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,450
during the day and by the end of the day

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:48,690
we had about 200,000 people using the

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:52,770
app the next day at about 8 a.m. in the

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,860
morning or backend kind of Bloor under

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,930
under load because there was just too

00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,150
many people trying to sign up at the

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,100
press in general caught up with the ID

00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,170
and by the end of the day we had about 1

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,260
million

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:12,090
yeah a few days later we launched in the

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:14,630
US a lot smaller scale but still full of

00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:17,220
work to do and still very valuable um

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:19,650
then we do we really is like a lot of

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,280
additional features to the app some of

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,660
those work a few UX improvements a lot

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,090
of those were adding new questions

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,280
because our understanding is evolving

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,770
constantly it's basically every every

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,360
week we had a set of new questions with

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,780
order about your symptoms or medical

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,400
stories and then more recently we

00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,620
launched in Sweden Sweden is quite an

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,070
interesting country because they didn't

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,930
have any lockdown um so comparing

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,640
comparing the stats between you know you

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,490
can be in Sweden might be very

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,270
interesting and then in parallel to that

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,850
it was obviously a lot of research done

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:59,940
by you know a great team at both KCl and

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,820
Zoey enough places and that culminated

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,000
very recently to a research paper

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,730
published in Nature Medicine which is in

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,340
one of the best you know science

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:16,680
journals out there so has been a very

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,600
exciting journey and you know the team

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,630
at Zoe and Casey have been like

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,960
extremely busy working around the clock

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,910
to normally support you know the app

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,970
launch new feature but also can't

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:35,310
promote it and to the research around it

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,350
but yeah to go back to my initial point

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,020
something that is really really unique

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,120
to this app I don't think it was

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,780
actually that many times that we

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,450
literally went from a 92 and that views

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,090
by 1 million users in less than a week

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:54,740
and so their exciting journey

00:15:51,090 --> 00:16:00,240
not without a rollercoaster of emotions

00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:02,580
so today we have about 3.5 million users

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,770
at the time of recording and more than 1

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,980
billion users or reporting their

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:11,100
symptoms daily we're publishing daily

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,440
map of the virus every day on our

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,740
website so you can know how the UK is

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,540
doing

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,210
we're doing similar things in the u.s.

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,940
and Sweden but I've just not not

00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,830
publishing better daily as I mention

00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,530
we've got like quite a few research

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,210
papers that have got published some of

00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,220
the main discovery that were main is

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,880
that coffin fever are actually just one

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,440
of symptoms that could you know tell you

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,360
you've got covered actually I think

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,670
there is about six different groups of

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,640
symptoms and one of the most interesting

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:46,540
one is actually in Austria which is the

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,160
loss of smell or test this is the one

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,170
symptoms that predict better whether you

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,360
have covered so about 2/3 of the people

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,910
that have come from commit actually have

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,920
lost smell or taste so if you were one

00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,340
of those people definitely time to go

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,080
and see your your your doctor and then

00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,240
last month rules have got you endorsed

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,920
by NHS Scotland and Wales that are truly

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,800
encouraging the population to use the

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,209
app to report their symptoms not only

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,730
for research but also because it's a

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:15,250
great tool for understanding spread of

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,760
the virus so that you can you know

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,060
prepare the hospital's better and that's

00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,890
logically relevant because we are

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:27,280
leading indicators versus hospital

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,500
admission so the numbers of people we

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,780
think that come it would increase first

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,410
in our stats then in the hospital

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:38,470
admission which stop to do increase to

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:42,670
and then sadly you know a couple of

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:45,790
weeks later death so we're very happy

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,160
with with all of that stuff so that

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:52,570
brings me to you know Zoe in react

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,820
negative so for us to pre kommentera the

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,670
kind of project we're doing we're on

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,700
nutrition's and we had two apps one was

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,980
used for managing our studies so

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,100
something that study participant would

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,140
use to report to lock their meals that

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,180
would be some kind of tackling task list

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,760
so that you know we tell them on that

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,620
day they need to do those things because

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,750
being part of study is like a very

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,480
specific and protocol and we've got a

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,910
second half that is more about showing

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,250
some kind of result based on the test

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,410
you did we can tell you you know how

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,890
some how

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,110
would be for you personally so ii have

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,880
really about nutrition food and and

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,840
informing you

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,890
and those two apps were developed full

00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:43,290
native one in swift one in kathleen so

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,590
that's basically for cup base this had

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,780
one one big problem which is a very low

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,240
bus factor obviously a lot of rework but

00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,980
also like a flexibility in the sense

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,690
when you just have one engineer that can

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,610
do the work on what platform you know if

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,490
you want to really push forward one of

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,240
the other if you just want to go faster

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,970
it's not that easy

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,650
and we certainly found that getting you

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,140
know a number by an engineer to learn

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,400
mobile environments with swift opening

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,990
is not like an easy task

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,600
and so I actually had or enjoyed

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,550
engineer that started working on Swift

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,330
to kind of speed up the development of

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:21,030
our iOS and yeah that definitely took

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,010
him several weeks to stop being reaching

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:27,900
point where it was able to work by

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:30,000
himself so that led us to to think about

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,230
native and basically we contacted

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,450
started to conduct an experiment

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,930
response you know can we rewrite or

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,910
Andreea

00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,650
with react native and the reason we

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,380
chose our under adapt is because at some

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,870
point as I said or Android engineers

00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,030
switch to an iOS because we wanted to go

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,650
faster in iOS because there was no point

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,480
in having two apps being exactly the

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,700
same we were basically not running twice

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,140
as much so we've decided to bet

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,660
everything on iOS just do it right

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,310
faster so at that point you know the

00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Android version was lagging quite

00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:03,420
significantly so we decided to run that

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,950
experiment with two developers or in the

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,680
wind engineers which was loading a third

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,960
platform and another engineers at

00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,000
joining us a couple of weeks before that

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,520
and had a bit of experience with we're

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,500
at native having worked with it for four

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,360
year as a sole developer and the goal

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,730
was to work for about six weeks and see

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,850
how far we could go with rebuilding the

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,650
app and officially learn about you of

00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,720
what is easy and what is hearts not just

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,970
you know redo the app as is but trying

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,510
to see what would be the things that

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:35,220
would bite us ultimately over that was

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,120
great and basically at that point we

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,249
were three weeks into the experiment

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,049
you know we've basically aborted it just

00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:44,440
because we've switched everybody to the

00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:46,330
Khilafat symptom study I so and at that

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,249
point we would choose reactivity because

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,159
there was no way we would be able to

00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:52,779
field an iOS version a coughlin version

00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,570
of common symptoms that he had in 36

00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:57,759
hours that was just not not achievable

00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,289
so you know based on our experience we

00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,210
were quite convinced that we could feel

00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:03,249
something quite quickly we've rag native

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,929
that would work cross-platform obviously

00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:06,580
was like a massive bet because we just

00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:10,360
didn't had any production experience

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,999
with it but you know embrace dudes and

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,269
you know we tried to just you know take

00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:18,879
the pain road so use Expo with the

00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,710
manage workflow types through because

00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:22,330
that is something we're using in our

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,369
experiment too and we're quite strongly

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,249
opinionated about the fact that's having

00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:30,429
some static typing was something worth

00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:33,460
doing react native navigation negative

00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:35,769
base components forming for managing

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,749
forms and a few other libraries I think

00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:40,600
one of the key things there that we did

00:21:37,749 --> 00:21:42,610
is just we didn't try to find what was

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,249
the best solution for each of those

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,080
basically picked you know the most

00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:50,289
obvious one like you know almost a first

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,820
search Google search results because we

00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:54,789
just didn't that time right we just

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,559
needed to move super fast so just took

00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:59,159
whatever we're playing with for

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,590
experiment not trying to double guess

00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:05,590
what was the best solution what went

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,850
well we've we've no this small

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,399
experience well the first thing is that

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,070
we shipped like super fast as I said in

00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:13,779
36 hour we had a first version it was

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,850
not great by any means but we you know

00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,610
we did had the first version of the app

00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,840
and we did take a lot of shortcuts like

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,730
the first version of yeah that was

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,710
published a few days later for example

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,749
didn't had password reset it was like

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:28,629
something that was definitely missing

00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:30,279
and requested by a lot of people the

00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:33,399
other thing that went very well is that

00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:35,769
you know when when you learn about react

00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:37,029
native you must be interested by your

00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:38,950
shortcut base and our experience has

00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:40,480
been yes we've shared almost everything

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,279
in two copies there's a few places where

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,100
there isn't leaf or Android on iOS but

00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:46,600
that's very very minimal and that's

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,750
super important because we don't have a

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,500
great QA process so I'm you know being

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,750
able to have this

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,370
shared copies and mostly the books that

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,000
you're gonna have they're going to eat

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,890
the two is extremely useful so we still

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,130
have some rendering differences between

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:05,140
iOS and Android but tend to be you know

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,500
on the margin not something absolutely

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,390
used and it's pretty easy for us to you

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,070
know actually detect those and fix those

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,070
and the third thing that went very well

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:17,770
is importing web developers so you know

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,570
literally we had two engineers that were

00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,790
familiar with react never done any

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,220
mobile engineering before and we asked

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,600
them to stop working the codebase 24

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,050
hours later they were productive and

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,520
that's that really amazing and that's in

00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,930
the context for ourselves the other

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,080
people working on the cupcakes were

00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,880
themself not expert right so it's it's

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,460
really easy for someone knowing react to

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,690
switch to writing reactive if we zoom a

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,940
bit of X cool the other thing that

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,890
worked very well or over the Europe days

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,490
that was actually one of the reason

00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,590
we're also considering react native or

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:54,400
Nutrition app and that saved us many

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:58,150
many times notifications set up was

00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,100
super simple um we forgot about FCM set

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,690
up initially and Android but when find

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,340
out about that that took us just you

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,740
know a couple of hours to set it up and

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,050
that was very convenient because again

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,570
Expo gives you an abstraction and you

00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:14,130
can basically reach and do it and I was

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:16,930
very easily through that mechanism and

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:19,600
and we still haven't need to check from

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,130
explore even two months later so there's

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,320
probably a point at which we'll need to

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,480
do that but actually exploits covering a

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,400
lot of feature and that makes our life a

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,200
lot easier

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,470
but there are some things we struggle

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,420
with so I think one of the key problem

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,010
we have is that we still not sure two

00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,680
months later when is good react native

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,960
and you know we basically took a lot of

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,640
shortcuts we trying to ship an app as

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,260
quickly as possible and there's

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,510
definitely things we know probably

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,120
didn't do well so for example one of the

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,400
debates we you know we didn't have

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,320
announced starting to have is it whether

00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,080
we should use books or not so we started

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,570
without hooks just with class components

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,980
and you know we didn't realize after the

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,929
fact that actually the world coming T is

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,370
moving towards towards hook so that's

00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:04,120
probably something we should stop

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,030
integrating

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,490
cut paste another thing that we can

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:12,670
struggle with is know how to style and

00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,170
reuse components so we tend to have you

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,380
know style sheets are recreated for

00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,150
every single screen and componentry is

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,800
quite quite small so again that's

00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:24,460
definitely some best practice there that

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,520
we did not fall and the last thing is

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,530
the ICD setup so the nice thing about

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,850
over-the-air updates is that you look

00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,400
they exist and you can push an update

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:36,100
without undoing native beers but also

00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:40,690
makes you will you know process a lot

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:43,360
harder that to set up and and it wasn't

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,340
clear to us at the beginning you know

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,990
when we needed to do over the year

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,010
updates versus when we needed to push

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:53,950
new native wheels again if we see cities

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:56,500
of Expo so over-the-air updates are

00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,720
amazing but the defaults are not

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,850
basically what you want so for example

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,070
the default is basically the up they

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,360
would be a synchronous on startup but if

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,680
you want to kind of know strongly

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,420
encourage people to use the latest

00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,950
version of your app and if your app like

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,870
you know ours is basically something

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:13,390
that you use only once a day you

00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:16,090
probably want to make it sink reduce on

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,400
startup at least to some degree so we

00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,840
change that but you took a few weeks to

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,080
really understand what was the update

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,240
behavior and credentials management for

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,910
the icd through Explorer at some point

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,860
was just entirely broken and they fix it

00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,720
and have been extremely responsive but

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,640
that really slowed us down and we just

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,340
really struggle as part of the

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,620
automation and and as I mentioned you

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,540
know one of the big question we were

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,190
asking yourself is when do you actually

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,990
need a native release so the

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,170
documentation on export was not entirely

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:49,060
clear now we understand it a bit better

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,860
a bit as also some other consideration

00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,740
which is actually quite nice to push a

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,850
new native peel because that means you

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,420
you're kind of you're guaranteed to

00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:01,780
soften on state for for people are

00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,580
installing the app whereas if you don't

00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,140
force update and start up you know that

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,270
puts you have a version from a couple of

00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,070
weeks ago with maybe not all the

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,450
questions that you're now asking there

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,960
are definitely things we did not explore

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:15,040
that we feel are quite important so

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,720
animations is definitely something we

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,940
did not invest in

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,170
but it's you know pretty clear from our

00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,600
experience that you can have a pixel

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,830
perfect UI and we have some screen

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,300
directional you know I wouldn't say they

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,700
are beautiful but they're simply you

00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,130
know not your classical Android or iOS

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,410
components and everything related to

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,000
native integration this is also not

00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,880
something that we had to do as I say

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,220
we're still using the export manage

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,210
workflow so some of the things that also

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:46,070
surprised us was that she really works

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,310
like obviously you know Facebook would

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:52,190
not use it if it did not work but we're

00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:53,690
a bit worried that you know I scale you

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,390
would have a lot of edge cases a lot of

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,350
issues and actually that mostly doesn't

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,560
happen so you've got three million

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,840
devices that are using your app and you

00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,250
know or crash rate is actually super

00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,330
reasonable and you know I've talked to

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:11,690
people you know working at Google Play

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:13,340
for example to confirm how we benchmark

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,310
against other apps and it's actually

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:19,550
quite good so something definitely quite

00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:21,320
quite happy shared code base was always

00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,270
an objective but there was always this

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,790
doubt that you know whether you can have

00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,830
a lot of if-else statement and actually

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:31,250
there it is not and the third thing that

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:34,040
is actually very important is not of our

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,750
top issues are related to magnet if you

00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,340
know we were wondering whether we would

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,320
end up in a situation where if something

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,780
doesn't work or you know lots of edge

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,600
cases and actually no the big problem we

00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:47,900
have or you know our UX is not good some

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,330
features needs improvement or back and

00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,520
sometimes it's not stable because we've

00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,290
got sillens traffic spike like nothing

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,970
is fundamentally related to react native

00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:59,780
there's nothing so far that was like

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:03,470
totally blocking so anyway thank you

00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:06,710
very much for for listening to our story

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,420
and we'll take Q&A there's a few things

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,730
I want to share with you before for

00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,460
living which is hey you can contribute

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,920
to the cup base we've made it open

00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,440
source so please give us a hand if you

00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,390
feel that that's important and we'll do

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,070
our best to integrate all all those tool

00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,170
requests but we're still not great at

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,560
managing open source project but we're

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,760
learning so please help and we are

00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,890
looking for people to help us you

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,530
building that had not just on pro bono

00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:37,050
basis but actually be part of zoe and

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,870
we're off on this product and nutrition

00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,190
product so thank you very much

00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,410
download the app if you're not already

00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,930
self reporting because that's important

00:29:43,410 --> 00:30:04,320
that's helping the NHS and advancing the

00:29:45,930 --> 00:30:06,780
science have a good day everybody hello

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,760
everyone and welcome to the Q&A part and

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,100
if you've got any questions ask them in

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,010
the chat and I will ask them to the

00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,750
speakers we've got em jr. Mikey Afonso

00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,360
EU media and we've got Peter as well

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,440
who's giving a second talk and so thanks

00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,840
for joining us thank you for joining us

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,760
for a live Q&A and first of all we're

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,260
gonna say like thank you for making this

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,810
app it's amazing that you guys have made

00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,400
this and how are you feeling now is is

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,920
any less stressful marrow is it still

00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:42,270
you still feeling that wave that rush

00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:43,980
still from the beginning it was hectic

00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,960
in the first couple of days because no

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,430
we're building an app in 24 hours 48

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,890
hours getting into it on to the iTunes

00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,200
stores and getting it running but that's

00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,820
only the start now every single time we

00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,470
make a mistake we get thousands of

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,700
people emailing us saying your app is

00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,160
broke and your ads collect the wrong

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,460
details so every mistake you make is now

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,520
magnified by so much so it is less

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,320
stressful in terms of time but it's all

00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,700
yours at the edge of your seat whenever

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,110
you deploy a new change wondering

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,460
whether it's gonna be a stream of

00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,890
complaints or when it's gonna be nicely

00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:18,330
quiet so those issues just feel so much

00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:20,340
bigger now then we've got one question

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,050
the chat so far already and they said

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,330
can you talk a little bit a little bit

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,530
about the kind of back-end you have so a

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,280
bit about the backend not the react

00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:31,860
native side but I guess I'll take that

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,250
one so our back-end is actually not

00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,920
particularly exciting it's written in

00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,330
Python with a framework called Django

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,770
which is you know your classical

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,530
framework to do kind of you know rest

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:46,230
services and then talking to database

00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:49,020
database is actually passe grass sequel

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,670
and all of that is is running on GCP and

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,170
back to the previous question so my core

00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,120
is about all the mistake we can make

00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,130
them the on the mobile app and I worry

00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,380
about the backend not not blowing up

00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,380
every day which is quite interesting

00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,480
when you know our or founders actually

00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,370
does TV quite a lot so sometimes you

00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,590
have traffic spike that literally goes

00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:10,530
from you know some number to five-time

00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,960
that numbers in thirty-second so even

00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,850
GCP cannot rescale fast enough so you

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,820
have to make interesting choice in terms

00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,890
of whether you spend a lot of money for

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,740
for those or not and just you know wait

00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,610
a minute for the auto scaling to happen

00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,990
yeah you know it's you know it's big

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,480
traffic when you're running into cloud

00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,860
provider scaling issues and I was that

00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,780
integration I mean it lets Commons

00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,130
frases are really native in our Jango as

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,990
well at Theodore but how did you guys

00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,740
find that integration Rizla set up quite

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,030
easily then or did it take much work for

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:44,340
you guys to set up compared to say a

00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:47,220
reactor port was it fine so I think from

00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,990
our perspective we it's Gengo has been

00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,770
or set up for forever

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:54,780
and before we're not doing react native

00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,430
we were doing full native so it's not

00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,080
very different from what we're doing and

00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,820
so we're pretty happy with that

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,210
we're not experienced with things such

00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,610
as graphic QL so completely compared to

00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,920
- but yeah otherwise there's just no

00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,510
harm normal back in exposing a few

00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,580
endpoints of arrest the thing that is

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:16,620
interesting about our app is that it's

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,120
mostly right which is very untypical you

00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,410
know you record your symptoms your

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,000
record you know your health condition

00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,800
but actually there is very little

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,940
feedback so it may actually make things

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,770
quite quite a lot easier for us cool

00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:33,090
we've got another few more questions in

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:34,530
the chat now Luke's asked and did you or

00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,300
your stakeholders have any reservations

00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,550
about deploying the MVP before it was

00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,900
fully ready like where they worried

00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,230
about the bad feedback or anything like

00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,220
that

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:47,040
being deploying so quickly go ahead Mike

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,780
this one is for you I'd say no they they

00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,120
were all behind us because we know time

00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,160
is of the essence that if we can get an

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,320
app out there that's just working even

00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,060
though it's basic functionality is there

00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,860
that would be something that we don't

00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,420
have right now you know we could spend

00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,220
you know seven weeks testing on the Isle

00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,260
of Wight and get nowhere near the

00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,750
audience we'll need to so criticality

00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,110
was more important than as long as it

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,850
worked

00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,250
it didn't matter as long as it worked in

00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,690
collected data the data is the key once

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,149
we have the data then we can start

00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,620
making predictions and assumptions and

00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:19,110
start to figure out what's happening

00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,909
with the virus in this country now it's

00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,940
amazing that your stakeholders had that

00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:25,409
MVP mindset as well mmm

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,030
so you touched on the Isle of Wight so

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,380
it's been asked this as well any

00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,320
thoughts on how this relates to their

00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:34,429
current contact tracing app or what

00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,429
interaction that will have with yours

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:43,980
yeah I think you know ultimately we

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,440
would like the contact tracing app to to

00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,110
succeed because if it does succeed you

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,899
know that will be good for the country

00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:54,480
we will be it unclear what will be the

00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:56,310
interactions I think you know it's

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,130
taking them quite a lot of time to roll

00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,750
out the app it's not entirely clear I

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,980
mean I'm not very close to that it's not

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,510
entirely clear if it's gonna you know

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,630
work because people have a lot of

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:09,030
privacy concerns and and we saw that all

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,340
self we saw that you know even though we

00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,960
don't have you know any kind of features

00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,630
like like tracing like that people

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,900
generally do care that's the number one

00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:21,600
thing on their mind so we're not totally

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,600
clear if you know they're going to

00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,460
succeed if not we'll we'll be there if

00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,200
they replace us and you know cover all

00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,460
our features then you know great good

00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,620
you know if it's good for the contrary

00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,820
no problem but the other thing is that

00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,200
we're targeting something a bit

00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,260
different which is phenomenally or app

00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,970
is about collecting data for research

00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,940
whereas follow me there up is about

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:45,090
contact tracing so the two are not

00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,690
entirely the same that's really really

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,730
interesting

00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,860
I am we've got a question here from

00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:52,260
Germany Jeremy you asked what are you

00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,520
using for testing and wasn't one of the

00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,780
things they got skips like they're

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,780
forgotten password feature

00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,270
yes it did get skipped like they like

00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:06,480
the the reset your password thanks for

00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,609
that my bear on launch was we can't

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,150
change our password I'm in adaptively

00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:14,280
filling it in which happens so our

00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,660
testing is attention is essentially as

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,359
developer testing and we have a cute

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,980
small QA team that iterates through some

00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:22,020
of the critical parts to make sure

00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,060
they're still working so it is largely

00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,290
manual right now that one of the

00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,730
problems of having this little

00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,550
experience as we had with react native

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,500
is knowing what the right tools are for

00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,750
testing for unit testing for integration

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,030
testing so we just didn't have the time

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,190
to learn up about that figure out what

00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,070
to be using it so we just ran with what

00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:45,390
we had with with the skills that we had

00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:47,520
has that changed contributions has that

00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:49,740
changed since then or is it still the

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,270
same haven't we have a few open source

00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,359
contributions coming in that are

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,950
starting to put some snapshot testing

00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,109
into our app which is given us some

00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,760
degree of confidence so the tests we

00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:02,760
have are now running on on a git commit

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,530
so we are have we have you know the test

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,710
coverage is nowhere near there but it's

00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,180
a start it can only get better and as

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,119
Union says you know contributions are

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,790
welcome to help us make this a bit more

00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,530
about and I think the the second thing

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:19,560
to give you know more context to people

00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:21,119
is that you know obviously Zoey core

00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,390
business is not you know building the

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,390
kavita symptom study app right so one of

00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,490
the big challenge that we have is you

00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,380
know we've diverted like a massive

00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,420
amount of resource to that like 80% of

00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,220
the engineering team now we're trying to

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,599
get people back to do stuff that you

00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,200
know eventually will help us have a

00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,390
business that that succeeds so

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,829
unfortunately we have quite a lot of

00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:47,069
trouble right now to spend enough time

00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:48,359
on making this app great great quality

00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:49,950
which is back to the point about the way

00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,510
we're trying to open source it and see

00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,410
if you know some people want to help us

00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:57,750
and contribute amazing we are the

00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,849
question in the chat which says how how

00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,890
long did it take to App Store to review

00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:02,760
and publishes in its first version you

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,740
know there's something a lot people

00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,819
worry about in who knows I've had wild

00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,170
speculations when it can take as long as

00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:10,200
two or three weeks how did you guys find

00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,750
that process we ran out of patience

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,450
after about

00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:16,030
two days and you got everybody in the

00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,190
company to contact anybody we knew to

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,410
try and push things along but it was two

00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,900
to three days but because it's a Cove

00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,030
adapt the requirements are also a lot

00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,160
more stringent so we have need to have

00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:29,710
ethics approvals you can't just put a

00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,180
covert app out there we are without some

00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,860
sort of ethics approval about the data

00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,390
you're collecting because it is

00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,730
personally personal sensitive

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,200
information so but we had all the

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,170
paperwork in line you know we have the

00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,140
contacts in with King's College London

00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,460
so the ethics permissions being able to

00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,770
prove we had that the permission was

00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,810
easy enough so it was just waiting for

00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:53,290
the normal process so about two to three

00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:55,870
days amazing one of the things I'd like

00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,130
to touch myself was you guys using Expo

00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,900
how did you find that because that can

00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,310
often be a bit controversial and

00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,390
polarized on community some people say

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,790
it doesn't scale but you guys have

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,290
proven that scales to well over three

00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,240
million users how have you found using

00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,130
that and is it all the way forward for

00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,340
you guys if you continue using react

00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,470
native when you have an app that doesn't

00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,140
require native modules that Expo doesn't

00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:20,560
support Expo is fantastic as a starting

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,240
point so for us with a co-ed app is we

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,890
wanted to stay with an expo for as long

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,980
as possible and we intend to try and do

00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,360
that so working within expose limitation

00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:32,230
was something that we were perfectly

00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,850
comfortable with and I've had experience

00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,940
with it before so I know how to do the

00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:40,230
builds and do the AppStore builds so it

00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,460
was just reusing what we already knew so

00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,380
didn't have a problem with expert I'd

00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,910
still recommend it as a way to get

00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,790
started particularly if you don't need

00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:52,300
those native native hybrid type

00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:53,380
applications amazing we've got one for

00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,230
Peters you don't ask you a question

00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,460
yourself Peter no yeah sure I didn't

00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,160
want to interrupt

00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,500
so you know you know what you know now

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:08,170
about react native do you think you can

00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:11,200
build it even faster that's a kind of

00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:12,880
debate internally I'll give you the view

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,400
of the VP of engineering and then my can

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,320
give you the the view of the software

00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,880
engineer actually you know typing the

00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:23,260
code um I'm not sure we were

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,130
significantly better at writing react

00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,900
than we were two

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:30,430
we're a bit better but not like by by 2x

00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,710
however I think the big difference is

00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:36,310
that um now we're really really aware

00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:38,710
that we could be a lot better and and

00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,690
again it's kind of you know how do you

00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,190
spend you know the time where you've got

00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,350
you know scientists and everyone asking

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,120
you for new questions and you know we're

00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:48,370
doing stuff with the government they're

00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:51,700
also in asking stuff so now you've got

00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:53,410
this concern streams of features and

00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,870
things you want to head and it's hard to

00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,000
carve time but I'm totally convinced

00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,070
that we could you know by spending like

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,450
a couple of weak like purely in terms of

00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,220
you know what are the right practice and

00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:07,650
refactoring a bit the copies after that

00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,650
we could be two times faster if not more

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:20,680
with the developer perspective I don't

00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,810
think we could have built it faster

00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,790
because we were working at a period

00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,960
where time was of the essence and I

00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,570
don't think our approach would have

00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,280
changed that much because when we are

00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,470
pushed for pressure we tend to fall back

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,420
into what we're comfortable with rather

00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,010
than picking up new things if we had

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,210
like a two or three months more

00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:40,000
experience maybe that would be the

00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:41,890
change the question but it's also you

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,020
know we were cutting corners as much as

00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,320
possible to get the get early release in

00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,850
and the case of MVPs are you embarrassed

00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,010
by what you released because that's

00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,500
that's the tail of other MVP and yes I

00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:56,290
was very embarrassed I was an apple to

00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,910
just reject it based on quality so I

00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:00,250
don't think we would have done it any

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,850
differently and I'm quite proud of what

00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:06,310
we've done in in that time

00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:08,260
amazing great question um we've got

00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,910
another one in the chat here which is

00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,500
said did you ever consider building it

00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,640
has a pwe I mean you guys said you

00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,890
didn't have loads of react native

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,930
experience like yeah did you ever

00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:20,710
consider not using that native and doing

00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:23,560
it in something else no we knew when it

00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:26,380
went on mobile so we we very very

00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,540
briefly considered make no let's just do

00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,530
it was react native react native is one

00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:34,210
of our it's one of our ideas that can it

00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,580
save us time in the long run and I'm

00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:38,090
sure Julian will follow up with with a

00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,850
lot more detail on that

00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,410
but pwace didn't didn't come into there

00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,480
because we wanted an app someone could

00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,940
download from the App Store because

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,100
there needs to be the heir of

00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,990
verifiability and validity there needs

00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,540
to be like a brand associated with it

00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:56,630
and having it on the Play Store and and

00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,190
the iOS App Store gave us a stamp of

00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:02,840
authenticity I don't think we could have

00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:04,340
got with a PWA that's very layer I would

00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,200
add you know notification there's a

00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,660
definite key features I mean you keep

00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,160
you can have some level of notification

00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,950
we've we've wet but it's certainly not

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,050
as well integrated in the operating

00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,490
system and that made like a massive

00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,290
difference when we turn on notification

00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:22,160
student lis we saw like a lot of more

00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:26,240
returning users and simply I'm just not

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,760
aware of any app well web app out there

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,470
that basically does what we do at the

00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,600
scale that we do so I think that back to

00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:36,890
what Mike was saying there is definitely

00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:41,300
a case for all the authenticity attached

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:43,220
to to having an app like that one of the

00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,500
earlier questions from the chat asked

00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,060
did you have to would you know as well

00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,420
in the US and Sweden do you have to

00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:52,910
separate the data between regions or how

00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:55,370
have you handled that so we've not

00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:58,790
separated the data between regions it's

00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:59,900
all stored in one tenant that's

00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,790
basically a question we asked ourselves

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,140
and we went also a bit further than that

00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:07,850
which is you know should we even have

00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:10,580
different apps entirely but ultimately

00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:12,680
that's again the same problem which is

00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,000
if you had six months to think about

00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,260
that and you know build old

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,290
infrastructure around it you would

00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:20,120
definitely separate everything we don't

00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:22,760
so we decided to just have altered that

00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,770
on one tenant and what we're super

00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,940
careful about is actually the export

00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:30,860
mechanism but some you know some of

00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,800
partners in the u.s. also have access to

00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,390
analyze that I in the UK because again

00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,430
we're not you know the people are not

00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:40,430
just looking at at their country in

00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:42,560
isolation there is value in checking

00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:44,380
what is the behavior between countries

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,390
and Sweden is a perfect example because

00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,490
ultimately as we done as a very

00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:51,440
different approach than you no other

00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:53,450
apparent country because they just

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,820
wasn't in lockdown so being able to

00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:57,860
actually you know double-check the

00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,390
behavior across those two countries is

00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,890
super valuable to the researcher and

00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,260
would be a bit of a shame to say hey you

00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,940
only have access to Sweden data not to

00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,230
you get a tower the other way around

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,000
so not everybody has access to

00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:09,560
everything but certainly some people do

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
and ultimately when you reach that point

00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,110
and you know it's not entirely clear

00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,940
that there is a very very strong

00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:17,780
benefiting in totally separating that

00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:20,390
there are at the database level amazing

00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,210
well I think that's pretty much it for

00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:26,210
questions and I think now we can launch

00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:36,320
into Peters talk on unifying yet native

00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:40,610
everywhere thank you again guys hello

00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:43,310
hello hello hey everyone sorry I can't

00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:45,830
be there today thank you for having me I

00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:47,660
guess none of you all are there today

00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:51,140
right because like the office is closed

00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,830
and stuff but thank you for having me

00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,140
anyway

00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:57,310
I really miss London I had such a great

00:45:54,140 --> 00:46:01,340
time when I came out there in August

00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:02,990
also spoke at react native London back

00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,340
then that was a really great opportunity

00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,520
to meet all of you we had a really good

00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:09,380
time afterwards I generally just just

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,200
miss it so sad that it can't be there

00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,660
today but super happy that thanks to

00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,210
technology we can make this happen and

00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:19,940
also thanks to taping my phone to the

00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:22,070
screen to make this recording

00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,680
higher-quality that's something you

00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:26,540
can't see but I'm throwing it out there

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,460
anyway today we'll be talking about

00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:32,120
unifying react native across all

00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:36,980
platforms potentially a controversial

00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:39,740
topic full of exciting information we're

00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:42,050
going to talk about a little bit of Expo

00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:44,510
a little bit of react native a little

00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:47,720
bit of Microsoft stuff and a little bit

00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:51,740
of reason which I particularly always

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:55,700
admire anyway if you haven't heard of me

00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:58,760
my name is Peter Picard chick this is

00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:01,250
the photo that I used to use and I still

00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,140
do back when I had a beard when I came

00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,640
to visit all of you I did have a beard

00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:10,760
but now I'm just sort of doing this like

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:17,810
clean-shaven kovat 19 pandemic locked in

00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:20,180
my house look going back to the topic my

00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:22,070
last name is pronounced PI's cars and

00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:24,260
chicks right it comes up all the time

00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:26,510
how do you pronounce your last name PI's

00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:29,630
cars and chicks that's that's a lot

00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:31,610
easier right I'm the co-founder and CTO

00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:35,110
of drafted which we'll talk about in a

00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:38,450
second I'm a Y Combinator alum w18

00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:40,580
winter eighteen batch we started as

00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,290
orchard and the pivoting a draft it so

00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:45,920
crazy to think about it's been almost

00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:47,330
two years I created an Apollo query

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,490
components view up hollow tell a couple

00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:52,190
years ago so if you use query components

00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:54,260
I played somewhat of a role in that

00:47:52,190 --> 00:48:00,710
a Mexico's first user believe it or not

00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:03,470
I love reason reason react I host the

00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:05,360
conference in Chicago and I helped

00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:07,430
contribute and also maintain a

00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:10,040
contribute a few popular JavaScript

00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:13,790
libraries that you may or may not have

00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,920
heard of anyway so if you haven't heard

00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:19,190
of draft bit we help teams build mobile

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,140
apps the Oh bowl up some people build

00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,570
are really cool and the mobile apps that

00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:25,280
we also build can be run as pwace

00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,020
directly in the browser right so it's

00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,630
pretty cool we just launched this new

00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:31,220
website on web flow check it out if you

00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,900
you know if you haven't it's actually

00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,880
really cool we got all these like

00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,500
animations kind of goes over you know

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,470
bringing your screens to life all that

00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,200
marketing jazz that you know that gets

00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:45,110
you excited anyway I'm pretty proud of

00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,780
because we just launched it the source

00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:50,510
code that we generate for your apps is

00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,400
pretty high quality right so this whole

00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:54,140
like low code no code thing is becoming

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,120
pretty popular but the difference

00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,730
between us and a lot of our competitors

00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,190
is that we still give you access to your

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:04,400
source code and that's a huge deal right

00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,990
a lot of the times these services are

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,430
using templates or some form of that

00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,780
behind the scenes they're just a

00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:12,020
plug-and-play your data and that's great

00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:14,570
but you know for a tool as powerful as

00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:18,260
ours we want you to be able to pass that

00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:20,420
off to you know a different team

00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,770
or reject and work on whatever else you

00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,230
weren't capable of doing without having

00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:26,090
to throw out your source code so we

00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:29,960
strive for making that source code super

00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:33,770
high-quality now I was watching my talk

00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,840
from August and I just sort of stumbled

00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,070
over a screenshot of what the Builder

00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,530
looked like back then

00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:42,230
right and this is about 2019 right this

00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:44,060
toy that we had right now I took a

00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:47,090
screenshot of what that looks like today

00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:49,640
check out this check this out right not

00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:52,310
only did we update the theme for

00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,380
whatever reason we we are now a power

00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:58,370
tool right we went from being just a toy

00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:00,980
to a powerful powerful power tool right

00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:03,340
this web preview works a lot better and

00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:06,050
we render fonts we render your assets

00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,580
you've got the ability to set any sort

00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,590
of prop from the react native side

00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,870
directly in draft it that's pretty

00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:14,750
powerful folks have been able to build

00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:16,670
their apps like from a sketch designer

00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,290
whatever in a matter of hours yes

00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:21,230
believe it it's true it's nuts

00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:23,600
but anyway enough about that selling

00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:26,000
pitch why am i here today well so

00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:29,990
currently drafted targets two platforms

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,110
right the web via pwace random mobile

00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:34,490
iOS and Android we use the same API but

00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:38,540
why so why can't we pursue other

00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:41,750
platforms well we're not there yet this

00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:45,740
is something that I'm personally just uh

00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:47,330
you know looking into I don't know much

00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,370
about it I don't know what our users

00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,770
think of it but I have discovered some

00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,510
really cool things that have come out in

00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:56,030
2020 and I'd love to share those with

00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:57,170
you all today the Internet obviously has

00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,360
a lot of ideas too

00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:00,860
so what you'll see is just sort of a

00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:04,070
collection of different things that

00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:07,460
folks are doing and I'm going to try to

00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:09,020
keep things as objective as possible but

00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:13,190
it gives you an idea of like some paths

00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:14,780
that you can pursue right so now when it

00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,730
comes to building layouts draft it

00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,530
supports everything under the Sun right

00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,660
you can build your entire layout really

00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,790
really quickly so what's stopping us

00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,280
from turning us on well we could right

00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:27,170
there is arguably nothing stopping you

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,300
from building your Apple TV I've been

00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,789
tried drafted but the reality is that

00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,689
nobody's asked for it yet

00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:36,429
so it doesn't matter right also like a

00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:38,109
big proportion of that too and a big

00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:40,209
portion of like all of you know the

00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:42,640
problem behind this is that even though

00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:45,640
the primitives are the same there are a

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,339
lot of nuances between different

00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:50,799
platforms obviously right we're used to

00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:53,489
specific experiences on iOS on Android

00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:56,709
on our Apple TV our Xbox or Playstation

00:51:53,489 --> 00:52:00,809
etc right so even though we might apply

00:51:56,709 --> 00:52:04,539
the same like declar divide ia's right

00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:06,939
it doesn't necessarily play out the same

00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:09,489
way in practice right we we like to keep

00:52:06,939 --> 00:52:12,429
our experiences the same now the world

00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:16,539
has done a really good job of unifying

00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:18,459
ios and android so far right sometimes

00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:20,140
we like to go down specific you know

00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:21,519
like I'm going to use material UX and

00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,189
building an Android app or I'm going to

00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:26,819
use hIgG because I'm building a is app

00:52:24,189 --> 00:52:29,619
but there have been some really nice

00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:32,650
apps that were designed that work across

00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:34,390
platform right now I'm sort of entering

00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,099
this new phase where can we get that

00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,779
working on the web can we get that

00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:41,199
working on the desktop right we'll talk

00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:42,880
about a little more that every once in

00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:45,669
awhile we hear this phrase like write

00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,559
once run everywhere right you've heard

00:52:45,669 --> 00:52:48,969
like write once use everywhere to and

00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:51,249
that's that's sort of a derivative of

00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:53,439
this right and this is sort of a dream

00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:56,079
that we haven't realized but may

00:52:53,439 --> 00:52:57,999
eventually realize I've seen some clever

00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,890
techniques to make this happen but we're

00:52:57,999 --> 00:53:02,409
far from you know doing this

00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:05,069
reproduction it you know very far from

00:53:02,409 --> 00:53:07,209
it right it's still the reality is

00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:09,939
possible we're just a couple of years

00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:11,589
away and things that make this problem

00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:13,989
really really hard are obviously

00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,609
different screen sizes right stark

00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:18,039
difference between an iPhone and the

00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:20,559
Apple TV right that's like a thing I

00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:22,989
have a 60-inch TV at home right and my

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,839
apples like six inches my iPhone is 6

00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:27,909
inches different interactions right I

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,640
interact with my phone with my finger by

00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:34,119
touching things and swiping I use my web

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,619
browser by using my mouse pad or just a

00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:39,579
normal mouse and scrolling right or even

00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:41,019
your keyboard my xbox is a controller

00:53:39,579 --> 00:53:44,530
right which is much different than

00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:48,280
either a mouse pad keyboard

00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:49,390
or swipe and touch right and then lastly

00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,040
like I've mentioned earlier the

00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:52,240
different user experiences right I'm

00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,910
used to a certain experience on my

00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,640
Android machine I'm used to a certain

00:53:54,910 --> 00:54:02,440
experience on Windows and I'm used to a

00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:04,870
certain experience on iOS right the

00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,570
easiest example that I can come up with

00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:10,210
like let the tip of the iceberg when it

00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:13,390
comes to this problem is the date picker

00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:16,480
right we have different date/time

00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:17,920
Pickers across Android and iOS for

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,120
whatever reason you know opinions are

00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,230
always different and one could be better

00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,970
than the other so on Android we have

00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:27,910
this thing that sort of pops up right

00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:31,030
it's got the material UI theme right and

00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:34,420
then that's what you use on iOS you have

00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:36,490
this inline date and time picker right

00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,050
doesn't show up in a modal or a pop-up

00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:41,020
right is inline you can place it

00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:45,070
anywhere so and react native was first

00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:49,270
coming out we had two separate and stark

00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:52,480
vastly different api's right the Android

00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:54,460
date picker was imperative right you

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,590
would have to call a function that would

00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,480
then open it up and the experience would

00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:59,680
be completely controlled right and then

00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,280
you get your date and time you'd be done

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:06,940
on iOS the date/time picker was a

00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,350
component write a declaration that a CAV

00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,660
Isabel prompt that would either show or

00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:13,270
hide they have your on change handler

00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:15,820
right so you'd have to manage the space

00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:17,410
of where that goes as well as any type

00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,350
of pop-up if you wanted there right

00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:22,900
otherwise it would just show up inline

00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:25,270
good and bad on both sides right but the

00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:28,690
community has made that easier right a

00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:31,120
great case study of how we can head

00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:34,270
towards the direction of cross-platform

00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:37,480
success is by unifying these experiences

00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:39,700
right the react native community is

00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,430
fantastic if you haven't seen it on

00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:44,770
github it's really nice right they offer

00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:48,580
a lot of different packages okay let me

00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:50,440
open this up they offer a lot of

00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:53,890
different packages that will come in

00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,230
handy right the day time picker is one

00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:58,119
of them another really popular one that

00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:00,670
they have is Bob right

00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:02,890
bob was a tool written by Satya that

00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:05,230
makes the process of scaffolding and

00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:07,650
building react native apps whether

00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:10,779
they're specifically to their native

00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:12,789
platforms or the web right they make it

00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:17,079
easy to build react native libraries

00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:20,200
right no more handling of type script or

00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:22,720
whatever that you need to do or Babel or

00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,809
flow it just does it for you right the

00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:31,380
same way that you know micro bundle or

00:56:25,809 --> 00:56:33,609
TS DX would do right when it comes to

00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,339
react native community there's also some

00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:38,049
exciting repos like if you've seen

00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:40,299
what's been going on when the react

00:56:38,049 --> 00:56:42,970
native world's lately write of making

00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:45,970
course smaller a lot of those components

00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:48,309
are ending up here right video async

00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:51,190
storage the daytime picture the camera

00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:52,690
the webview etc right so if you're

00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,630
looking for a place with really high

00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:57,240
quality components for react native

00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:00,579
nothing check out react native community

00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:03,579
now on the other end of that reason is

00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:06,960
also making this easier right if you

00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:10,660
haven't heard of reason reason is this

00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:13,660
language lets you write simple and type

00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:17,170
safe and very very fast JavaScript

00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:22,539
looking code so it's got a JavaScript

00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:26,799
like the syntax with that's powered by

00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:28,869
the Oh camel API right and so you can

00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:31,509
use reason for a variety of different

00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:33,849
things for web for native right it

00:57:31,509 --> 00:57:35,380
compiles down to byte code right which

00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:37,420
means forget the JavaScript layer

00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,559
altogether give me a small bundle and

00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,769
I'll talk about that in a second

00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,539
there's also a reason react right so

00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:46,950
reason was actually created by the

00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:50,170
creator of react fun fact right and

00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:51,609
reason react the pitch there is a safer

00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,230
simpler way to build react components

00:57:51,609 --> 00:57:54,970
right you get a great site type system

00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:57,069
with an even better developer experience

00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:59,529
right and you can watch the video Jordan

00:57:57,069 --> 00:58:02,410
walked a creative react fun fact the

00:57:59,529 --> 00:58:05,309
first talk that Jordan gave since

00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:10,210
releasing react in 2013 it's pretty cool

00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:11,780
anyway so now a little bit about why

00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:13,340
reason is making this

00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:16,880
Cerre right like how is this all coming

00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:20,390
together Peter well there's this tool

00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:24,050
called reverie UI right and what reverie

00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:27,640
why is is a library written in native

00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:30,770
reason that compiles to the web and

00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:33,530
native desktop apps right targeting

00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:38,240
Linux Windows Mac OS with one code base

00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:42,470
you can go across all all those react

00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:44,270
native iOS android derivative is in the

00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:46,520
works right but right now it's only that

00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,990
so I've got this gift right here and

00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,760
usually can see it's a little laggy but

00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,810
that's not what it's like right this is

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,460
a smooth animal

00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,710
excuse me smooth animations running

00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:57,230
directly in the browser they've got a

00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:58,430
lot of great examples to hover calculate

00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:01,940
or whatever they take a second to

00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:04,400
compile something worth checking out ken

00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:06,410
wheeler built this app called camel

00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,660
synth I actually downloaded it and it's

00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:11,780
blazingly fast like did you see that it

00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:13,220
opens up instantly right the nice thing

00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:17,030
about these apps is that are super small

00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:19,760
and they're very light on memory an

00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:20,980
example of what that looks like is jared

00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,410
Foresight's

00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:26,900
kim ogia right so we've all used the

00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:29,270
emoji dan picker I think we have or not

00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,450
just the emoji picker right I think it's

00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:34,190
a command control space or whatever it

00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:36,500
is you get the Moche picker well he

00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:37,970
decided to rebuild that in reason to see

00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,940
like what it's capable of and he

00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:42,620
compared it against there was a

00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,710
different version of it called emoji bar

00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:50,030
right Mogi bar is an electron app q moji

00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:52,730
is a reason app right same exact style

00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:54,710
of code right same exact functions all

00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,660
it does is show you all the emojis and

00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:59,840
the ability to search for those it's

00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:03,830
quite snappy it's very fast and it works

00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,450
as a menu bar app then lastly in terms

01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:07,550
of like cross-platform stuff there's

01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:11,630
oniy them right and that's a text editor

01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:14,450
it's written in reason powered by live

01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:16,940
them which is them under the hood and it

01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:18,710
supports all of the vyas code language

01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:20,930
servers and extensions right so you get

01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:22,100
this really really fast text editor that

01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,890
opens up immediately

01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,460
right that uses your favorite BS code

01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,170
extensions

01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,270
definitely worth checking out there in

01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:34,339
an Alfa it's a paid product that's 35

01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:36,109
bucks but I strongly recommend are you

01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,599
taking a look it's totally worth it it's

01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:41,089
super fast I love it

01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:44,240
so how does all this compare to electron

01:00:41,089 --> 01:00:45,650
right before we get too far ahead right

01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,089
we're talking about like a completely

01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,650
different language that does a lot of

01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:51,230
different things that gives us some

01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:53,060
exciting results right so electron

01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,589
halves are written in JavaScript and

01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,410
what they do is they bundle up the

01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:59,960
entire node engine v8 right which is a

01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:01,550
minimum of 120 megabytes that means that

01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,280
if you wanted to build a simple hello

01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:06,970
world app in electron the app would be

01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:11,690
at least a hundred and twenty megabytes

01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:14,240
humo G on the other hand right which

01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:17,240
doesn't use electron is a measly three

01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,040
point four megabytes right and then it

01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:21,050
uses half the memory of Moche bar -

01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,790
that's pretty exciting right

01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:25,070
it's also worth pointing out that

01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:27,530
electron apps don't mean react natives

01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:29,570
right they mean any type of JavaScript

01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:32,330
for example atom and vias code are

01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:36,320
written using electron but they don't

01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:39,890
use reacts and that's okay so when you

01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:42,950
want to compare reverie and reason to

01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:45,560
electron well what they do is they

01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:47,720
compiled to native byte code your apps

01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:51,349
are small and fast and they just work

01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,880
right there's no JavaScript layer that

01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:55,970
needs to talk to it strips all of that

01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,619
out while retaining the same structure

01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:59,540
oh before I get too far ahead

01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:02,060
I had this open this is the website for

01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:03,920
owning them it's uneven that IO 35 bucks

01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:06,349
it's really really cool they've got the

01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,589
public roadmap right it's a great it's

01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:12,680
actually someone from think that

01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:14,570
Microsoft typescript team don't quote me

01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:16,520
on that but they switched over to using

01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:19,430
a reason and reverie and built this

01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:23,240
amazing infrastructure for an editor

01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:25,820
anyway so now I'm moving on what are

01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:28,070
other options right so there's react

01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:29,390
native Windows and Mac OS right so those

01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:31,760
react native Windows and then there's

01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:34,520
react native Mac OS and those do exactly

01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,380
what you think them to do right

01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:39,079
interestingly enough when I was working

01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:40,729
on this presentation Microsoft just like

01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:43,549
Vail's an overhaul of react native

01:02:40,729 --> 01:02:45,289
windows is just pretty cool and what you

01:02:43,549 --> 01:02:47,499
can do if it's not already obvious use

01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:51,349
the react native primitives to build a

01:02:47,499 --> 01:02:53,239
desktop apps for mac OS and windows

01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:55,849
there's still that JavaScript layer

01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:58,160
right that still lives there but the

01:02:55,849 --> 01:03:00,849
nice part is is the same exact

01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:04,670
primitives that you're used to apply to

01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:06,440
apply to desktop apps now I'm not a

01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:08,450
windows person but I know some of you

01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,589
are right you might be wondering how is

01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:13,299
this different than the universal

01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:16,430
Windows platform well the same way that

01:03:13,299 --> 01:03:18,709
react native uses iOS and Android native

01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:21,769
components under the hood react native

01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:24,739
windows uses Universal Windows platform

01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:29,719
components uwp under their hood right so

01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:31,969
the same idea same characters with the

01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:33,619
bridge but they just talk to different

01:03:31,969 --> 01:03:35,779
component under the hood right so it's a

01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:37,670
really cool and exciting project you

01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:39,650
should check out especially if you want

01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:43,309
to build a Mac OS app I've always wanted

01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:45,440
to do that but obviously timing is rough

01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:47,089
so maybe what I'll do is I'll take drap

01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,959
and try to compile it to that using

01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:53,959
those primitives what else okay so

01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:57,019
another really cool demo that I've seen

01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:59,900
lately is cross the road and what is

01:03:57,019 --> 01:04:03,619
Crossy Road Crossy Road is an example of

01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:05,420
a game written using expo web right so

01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:07,759
maybe you've played this before right

01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,329
there's an Apple TV app for it it's it's

01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:09,589
really cool

01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:12,729
check out those animations check out how

01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:15,709
smooth that is right so this works for

01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:17,989
native mobile or native iOS and Android

01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:20,869
right and it also works on the web with

01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:24,349
one code base right and that's because

01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:27,259
expo has recently introduced support for

01:04:24,349 --> 01:04:30,259
pwace right that means same code base

01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:35,539
same api's that work really nicely

01:04:30,259 --> 01:04:37,729
across different platforms right and the

01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:40,369
nice part about this is is that they do

01:04:37,729 --> 01:04:46,219
a very good job of gracefully degrading

01:04:40,369 --> 01:04:48,229
the experience for a you know api's that

01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:49,729
don't exist on the web right we all know

01:04:48,229 --> 01:04:51,589
what the web is like and we all know

01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:54,999
that native and

01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:57,140
have better things like permissions and

01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:58,700
gyroscope and all these different things

01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,779
that we can't use on the web right and

01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,729
they do a very good job of making sure

01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:04,190
that your app doesn't crash right but

01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:07,009
you still get to use the same API and

01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:09,650
how that works is expo web uses react

01:05:07,009 --> 01:05:13,719
native web right react native web is a

01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:16,519
library let's open this up

01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:19,849
react native web is a library developed

01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:21,739
by Nicolaus at twitter and what it does

01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:24,670
is it takes the react native primitives

01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:27,920
and makes them work in the browser right

01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:31,729
and Twitter isn't a great example of a

01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,430
PWA I have powered by uh it's actually

01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:36,170
powered by wrap native web right it was

01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:39,079
actually pioneered at Twitter so if you

01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:40,789
go to twitter.com on your browser or on

01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:42,259
your mobile phone what it does is it

01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:46,369
opens up a PWA

01:05:42,259 --> 01:05:48,170
and basically sinks and caches the app

01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:49,700
player and then only fetches the data

01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:52,190
right so if you turn off your internet

01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,960
connection right now Twitter would still

01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:56,089
be usable right you wouldn't get any new

01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,619
stuff but it's not like that typical

01:05:56,089 --> 01:06:02,029
experience where everything sort of

01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:04,700
fails right so it's one of the ways that

01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:07,400
we a draft bit power our builder right

01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:10,460
we give you the live preview center

01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,559
screen of what's going on in the web

01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:15,739
browser and also on your mobile phone

01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,219
and we use some of that to power our own

01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:20,420
stuff

01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:23,119
okay now expo HTML analyst was recently

01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:27,380
released right so what this is is a

01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:29,180
component library lets you use HTML

01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,910
elements like block quote and heading

01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:33,469
one two three four five and and blink

01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:35,539
and footer and all the elements that

01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:38,569
you've heard of as react native

01:06:35,539 --> 01:06:40,729
components right so you might be

01:06:38,569 --> 01:06:42,979
wondering like wow another like what do

01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:45,170
i do with this right well the nice thing

01:06:42,979 --> 01:06:47,329
about expo HTML elements is that they

01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:49,880
will help you optimize your SEO and

01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:52,549
accessibility right because they use the

01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,609
same primitives that the web offers

01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:58,910
right they compile and degrade nicely

01:06:55,609 --> 01:07:00,380
across native and iOS too so here's an

01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,969
example of what that looks like so

01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:04,069
you've got on the left hand side snack

01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:06,259
Expo that I opened right

01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:08,749
like a website and you've got the phone

01:07:06,259 --> 01:07:10,640
running on the right-hand side right so

01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:12,349
it does this really nice job of putting

01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,690
the other header the footer the main

01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:17,359
title article section right like all

01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:20,420
just like native components and so on

01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:23,239
the left hand side is the HTML web

01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:25,819
experience right and so whatever net

01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:29,209
expose done is apply that same concept

01:07:25,819 --> 01:07:31,940
to mobile right that's really really

01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:34,880
cool so if you wanna live in cities

01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:36,440
between react native web and HTML

01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,619
elements is like they're sort of reverse

01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:42,279
so wrap univ web brings view text image

01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:46,039
and all those fun things to the browser

01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:49,699
right and HTML elements bring things

01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:53,059
like aside an article bold to native

01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:54,949
right another really cool thing that

01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:57,829
expose done recently is Universal

01:07:54,949 --> 01:08:01,309
authentication flows and what this means

01:07:57,829 --> 01:08:05,599
that you can write these same API for

01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:07,670
logging into Twitter logging into github

01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:12,739
logging into whatever service that you

01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:14,569
want directly from using the same exact

01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:17,659
code base right and that's super super

01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:19,009
cool the docs are super well put

01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:21,380
together as you can see here I was like

01:08:19,009 --> 01:08:24,710
scrolling for a specific thing I can't

01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:26,839
find it but oh here it is

01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:29,719
right so they they offer everything from

01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:32,119
coinbase Apple Facebook Spotify slack

01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:35,359
github Dropbox identity for uber read

01:08:32,119 --> 01:08:37,849
and okhta Google the list goes on right

01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:42,349
and now that experience will work on the

01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:44,359
web and on mobile right awesome that's

01:08:42,349 --> 01:08:45,739
what I have to share for today make sure

01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:48,469
you follow me on Twitter twitter.com

01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:50,509
slash Peter PME same with github Peter

01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:51,940
PME all the way across the board and if

01:08:50,509 --> 01:08:53,750
you're interested check out draft bit

01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:56,060
despite everything going on in the world

01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,560
rapid is still hiring if you're

01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:59,810
interested in the space if you're into

01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,119
visual programming right I still

01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:03,949
consider that programming whether or not

01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:05,210
you're typing code or doing something

01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:09,199
there's still this whole thought process

01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:11,929
behind it right so please reach out

01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:14,569
we're hiring and hopefully folks liked

01:09:11,929 --> 01:09:15,290
this idea with notion so I want to try

01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:17,299
something different

01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:18,469
hopefully you all didn't hate me for it

01:09:17,299 --> 01:09:20,540
but I put together my presentation and

01:09:18,469 --> 01:09:22,250
notion I figured since we're all virtual

01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:24,710
right it might be a little easier for me

01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:26,420
for doing demos and embedding things so

01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:27,859
I'm sure I'll see in the YouTube

01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:29,359
comments whether you like it or not you

01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:33,230
know it's easily you can thumbs down it

01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:35,989
or you know tweet something really bad

01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:38,469
or whatever but I'll know and that way

01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:40,609
I'll know never to do it again anyway

01:09:38,469 --> 01:09:41,089
I'm gonna share this link with all of

01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,489
you

01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:44,779
there's plenty to learn from here I'll

01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:46,940
put a lot of ring clinks I'm here for

01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:48,710
reason react reverie react native web

01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:51,589
reckoning of windows cross here oh don't

01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:54,170
even even the correct native TV OS but I

01:09:51,589 --> 01:09:56,989
didn't talk about but anyway thank you

01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:58,909
so much again for having me I can't wait

01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:03,530
to see everybody in person once this is

01:09:58,909 --> 01:10:18,380
all over until then see you later thank

01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:20,090
you hello and welcome to the second part

01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,889
of the QA we've got all the speakers

01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:24,020
back again for another one so please if

01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:26,179
you've got any questions ask them in the

01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,710
chat thank you Peter for that amazing

01:10:26,179 --> 01:10:30,110
talk it was really interesting to hear

01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:31,880
about and first of all I just like to

01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:34,760
touch on like how have you found the

01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:37,579
transition to reason a draft bit I was

01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,079
like how's that gone for you there were

01:10:37,579 --> 01:10:44,510
a couple road bumps along the way

01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:46,070
right the strong parts of reason our

01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:49,280
sort of features that like neither

01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:51,020
JavaScript or typescript support right

01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,579
so it was a little weird getting into

01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:54,829
the whole like okay what do you mean

01:10:52,579 --> 01:10:57,079
this needs to exist or it doesn't right

01:10:54,829 --> 01:10:59,300
but but then after that like after that

01:10:57,079 --> 01:11:01,940
all sort of clicked it's been smooth

01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:03,949
sailing and I know some folks may like

01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:05,540
roll their eyes when I say this but I do

01:11:03,949 --> 01:11:08,719
see reason is like a competitive

01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:10,550
advantage because you just write stuff

01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:12,369
and it works you know like you catch

01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:15,679
your compile errors so it's very fast

01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:17,630
the types don't get in the way so like I

01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,520
am very passionate now like I see the

01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:21,230
vision and I and I use it and I I

01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,829
strongly recommend to everyone at least

01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:26,360
give it a shot you know do that one PR

01:11:23,829 --> 01:11:27,800
introduce reason into a typescript

01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:31,050
project you get type safety on both

01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,580
sides and see what you think mm-hm

01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:33,630
I was running asked if you would just

01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,940
talk us through a little bit more about

01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:37,560
your the rest of your tech stack drop it

01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,180
I know you're using Expo you're using

01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:43,740
reason what else does your tech site

01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:45,540
look like there yeah so we use reason ml

01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:49,110
on the client with reason react rate

01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:52,050
which is react for reason we use a palo

01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:55,200
graph QL that's also written in reason

01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:57,390
we get nice type safety in our queries

01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,400
to our back-end is written in typescript

01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:01,230
right so when folks think that I'm

01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,720
biased and say oh you've never given

01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:07,560
types with shots like no I very well do

01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:09,990
and I you know I think every day folks

01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:11,730
seem to say oh I you know like this is

01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,780
super slow but anyway so we use

01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:15,930
typescript on the server

01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:19,890
Postgres is our database we host on

01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:22,560
flied IO which is a distributed on the

01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:26,370
edge hosting company check them out they

01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:30,450
were recently a YC company a very very

01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:32,430
great scaling and hosting solution let's

01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:37,710
see yeah we use a lot of state machines

01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:38,580
and that's about it what's really

01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,680
interesting is really interesting here

01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:42,570
that Bret the tech side so I got one

01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,550
question from the previous talk in the

01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:47,340
chat which I missed out and it's just

01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:49,710
how is there data and analysis with AI

01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:53,430
and m/l methods coming along so this is

01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:56,760
on the eco over that and it's it's

01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:58,950
coming along very very well I mean

01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:02,010
neither Michael and I are part of

01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:04,110
Dustin's team so we can only be very

01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:06,360
general about it but um the one thing I

01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:08,460
would say is do read or blog coveno

01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:11,460
joins om slash blog where you do have

01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:13,620
quite a few updates and the one thing

01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,960
we're trying to do right now is I'm

01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:19,530
trying to predict early on your symptoms

01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:21,650
if if you have covered or not one of the

01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:24,690
things we found very very early when

01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:26,100
doing research is that the official

01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:28,110
symptoms which are you know do you have

01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:29,550
cough and fever actually not very good

01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:33,480
predictor of whether you have covered or

01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:36,120
not there is a think about six groups of

01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:38,430
different symptoms which was video

01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,290
surprise different people a very

01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:42,270
different reaction to take of it

01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,830
and actually one of the main one the the

01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:44,860
best predictor so far it's something

01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:46,600
called that is as

01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:49,540
being called anosmia which is the loss

01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,270
or smell or test and so 2/3 of the

01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:55,420
people that have come from covet as in

01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:57,520
they've been tested and and you know we

01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:58,810
know they have it have that symptom for

01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,600
example so that's actually the best

01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:03,370
predictor so there's a lot of research

01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,170
going on in the background and quite a

01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:07,900
few papers ever have been published

01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:11,110
already or going to be published in the

01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:12,700
next few week plus this huge work that

01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:15,670
we're doing to try to have like a better

01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,350
model for a predicting covet and you

01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:20,320
know it's it's not perfect that we think

01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:24,910
we're making really good headway toward

01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:26,590
that amazing and we've got a question in

01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:31,080
the chat from Brian who says what is

01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:31,080
next on the roadmap for draft bit Oh

01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:39,670
exciting stuff so what's next on the

01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:41,380
roadmap for draft bit better data

01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:44,410
integrations right a lot of folks are

01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:47,020
asking for things like firebase graph QL

01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:49,930
right we support we support rest right

01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:52,630
now really really well but now we have

01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:55,480
to work on that another feature that

01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:57,880
like is super exciting is passing data

01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,950
between screens it's such an easy task

01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,000
to do when you're writing code a little

01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:03,400
trickier when you're trying to do it

01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,590
visually so we're in like the final

01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,850
testings of that and then we'll be at

01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:08,860
the point where you could build a fully

01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:10,810
fledged mobile app you know start to

01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:14,280
finish without having to do any custom

01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:16,000
code logic which is super exciting

01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,350
something else that folks have been

01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,540
asking me about is authentication

01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:21,670
whether it's like firebase or Facebook

01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:24,070
or Google sign-in right being able to

01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:26,770
just like throw that in there a lot of

01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:29,140
the times we spend time coding these

01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,680
things right and like it's always

01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,880
different

01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:33,370
right as somebody who's written a lot of

01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,860
OAuth implementations I never seem to

01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:38,350
reuse the implementation that I've

01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:40,210
written right and the nice part about

01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:42,460
what drafted offers is I can just sort

01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:43,630
of drag and drop the button right and

01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:45,190
like I don't really care about the

01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:47,440
implementation under the hood anymore

01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:49,570
because it just works right and at that

01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,760
point it's like well it works and I can

01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:55,330
see what the code generates so that's it

01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:57,670
so that's another big one yeah wow yeah

01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:58,750
drag and drop off that would be a a real

01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:02,710
game-changer there

01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:04,540
Yeah right the real future and we've got

01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:06,040
another question the chat here about

01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:07,750
state machine so you mentioned state

01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,830
machines what live you are using for

01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:13,870
that and are you using them so right now

01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:15,070
David KP knows X state is really really

01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:18,490
cool right

01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:21,640
it helps us visualize how we need to

01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:23,440
tackle a problem that's that's something

01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:26,950
that we've been like using in term from

01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:28,630
like a planning perspective otherwise a

01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:31,830
lot of the times too we just sort of

01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:34,900
like hand roll like the implementation -

01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:36,220
there's been a new state machine library

01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,720
written and reason that I've been

01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:40,120
participating cited about haven't used

01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:44,020
it yet but going to see how we can take

01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:45,640
advantage of that I've got a question

01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:47,140
here for the first app which is do you

01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,200
have plans to expand the actor other

01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:53,470
countries like data with greater

01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:57,100
demographic diversity in the patients so

01:16:53,470 --> 01:17:00,250
the short answer is probably not and we

01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:02,560
would love to but there are two

01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:05,260
difficulties the first one is again as I

01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,790
said Zoe's business not about supporting

01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:08,410
the covered 19 symptom tracker and

01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:10,600
releasing in a new country actually

01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:12,730
takes quite a lot of effort a lot of

01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,680
time there's obviously no translating

01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:16,330
the app but then you know there are

01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:19,330
plenty of other aspect because every

01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:20,590
single country has different rules and

01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:22,990
therefore that something you need to

01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:24,990
take into consideration and the second

01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:27,370
thing is actually the legal aspect

01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:29,140
basically I'm you know extending to

01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:31,720
other country means we basically also

01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:34,090
extend or or footprint in terms of legal

01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:36,610
aspect we need to cover and that's

01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:38,380
really hard so if any you know if we

01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:40,720
have any country that reach out to us

01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:42,760
you know group of universities or a

01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:44,890
government or super keen and want to

01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,630
facilitate that I will definitely listen

01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:48,220
to them there is one specific word

01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:51,190
that's actually happening so that's one

01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:55,000
specific one possibility but overall

01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:56,710
we're not trying to expand or self it's

01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,770
basically if if someone reach out we'll

01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:01,540
try to do it but not otherwise that's

01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:04,170
very interesting another one for you

01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:06,760
here Peter and you touched briefly on

01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:09,130
councils as targets react native like

01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:12,540
PlayStation Xbox which do you think it's

01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:14,550
possible all likely yeah absolutely

01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:18,960
so react native for windows actually

01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:20,790
supports the xbox and and any sort of

01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:25,320
platform on the universal Windows

01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:27,420
platform I think so I did bring out the

01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,440
PlayStation I think there is a

01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:30,630
development

01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,010
I think Sony actually does use react

01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:35,040
native for some of their things don't

01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:36,900
quote me on that it's just not something

01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:40,890
that I've pursued but definitely when it

01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:43,710
comes to like Xbox that is that is a

01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:44,580
possibility that's really interesting me

01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:45,060
really interesting to see that in the

01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:48,000
future

01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:50,280
getting that cross-platform and another

01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,350
thing is well it's not like in your in

01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,640
your road and building draft bit what

01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:56,150
was the hardest thing you had to come

01:18:53,640 --> 01:19:00,870
overcome or hardest bug that you had to

01:18:56,150 --> 01:19:03,600
fix the challenge oh man there's plenty

01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:05,460
so the crude like the sad reality of

01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,560
building drafted is that it's not your

01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:10,710
typical crud app right like we are

01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:13,410
building a platform that builds apps and

01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:15,210
you know coming from you know this like

01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:18,150
fast-moving engineering environment that

01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:20,370
I'm used to the reality of it was we

01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:21,210
ship things and things break right and

01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:23,280
that's where we sort of got the

01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:27,090
stability on the on the recent side

01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:28,710
right the hardest parts are you know the

01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:30,120
compiler right how do we get this code

01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:33,420
to generate the way that we need to

01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:35,280
dynamically another part is like how do

01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:37,050
we sync your code so we've got we use

01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,790
like expose live preview and like our

01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:41,220
web servers talk to expose web servers

01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:43,230
which talk to your phone right sometimes

01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,610
like you know there's like a delay

01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:46,380
between what you click and what you see

01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:49,470
right how can i how can we improve that

01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:51,750
experience and lastly some of just like

01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:54,840
the app building logic right like how do

01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:57,360
we dumb down such a complex thing right

01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:59,130
like being able to move in an onboarding

01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,690
experience you know let's just say

01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:02,130
you've got five screens right like

01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:04,200
what's your first name what's your email

01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:06,030
what's your phone number right going

01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,860
through those things that you have to

01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:09,270
think about it's like where do I hold

01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:11,460
the state for all these things right do

01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:14,640
I save it do I make a request on every

01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:17,100
page right are those decisions up to the

01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:21,750
user building the app or do we make

01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:24,060
those decisions for you right so I know

01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,350
I answer the question in a variety of

01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,500
different ways but those are all

01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:28,900
problems that we sort of

01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:31,150
of you know try to tackle on a on a

01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:32,920
daily basis and when I was hiring two if

01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:35,470
you like you know complex stuff like

01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,300
that it's not an easy question to answer

01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:39,280
of course is gonna be a wide wide range

01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,360
of problems so another question for you

01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,160
here is a

01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:44,790
what kind of cloud-based infrastructure

01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:48,190
the generated code is compatible with

01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:50,170
arguably everything right so because we

01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:52,600
do strive and making sure that the code

01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:53,920
is readable and written like a senior

01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:56,800
level engineer there's nothing stopping

01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:58,330
you from using any service like I

01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,700
mentioned like right now we we support

01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:04,390
rest but graph QL and stuff like

01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:07,180
firebase basically opens that up for for

01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:08,620
any type of infrastructure right like

01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:10,360
with the rest of you if you come from a

01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:13,270
traditional rest background you plug in

01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:15,340
play your endpoints and that works the

01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:19,330
exciting thing with graph QL is having

01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:21,790
our you know like Explorer so we we run

01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:23,140
an introspection query on your graph QL

01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:24,490
database figure out all the different

01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:27,700
points and then all you have to do is

01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:29,980
click to build those queries right and

01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:32,140
then graph it takes it from there we we

01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:37,180
handle all the boilerplate of loading

01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:38,830
air states and all the likes there so

01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:40,120
another question in chat for you it's a

01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:42,370
bear challenge as well so you mentioned

01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:44,230
it's so easy to build one app is there a

01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:47,380
link the demo is a new beta app being

01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:49,900
built in 10 minutes or under no but I

01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:52,930
actually passed this off to marketing

01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:54,280
and we should totally do this so it's

01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:57,400
not out yet

01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:59,320
but you can but we'll have that for you

01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,600
soon I'll come up with maybe I'll like a

01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:02,980
rebuild like Instagram or like a simple

01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,400
version of it and then you could you

01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:07,480
know you can see it for yourself amazing

01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,520
well it looks like that's the questions

01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:11,680
there thank you so much loss three of

01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,420
