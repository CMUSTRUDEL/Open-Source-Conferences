üíª The Talk(s)

1) Fighting COVID-19: How ZOE went from idea to 1 million users in less than a week with React Native - by Julien (https://twitter.com/julienlavigne) and Mike (https://twitter.com/isofarro)

ZOE is the healthcare startup behind the COVID Symptom Tracker, an app helping scientists and authorities understand the symptoms and spread of the virus. More than 3M people participated in this citizen science project, leading to the publication of several research papers and discoveries at https://covid.joinzoe.com/blog.

The COVID Symptom Tracker is the first React Native app released by the ZOE engineering team. In this talk, they will share their experience adopting RN, the challenges they faced and whether they believe this choice was the right one in this context.


2) Unifying React Native Across All Platforms - by Peter Piekarczyk (https://twitter.com/peterpme)

When React Native first came out it was primarily meant as a way to build mobile apps using React. Since those humble beginnings, the React Native ecosystem has exploded and supports much more than just mobile. From the Xbox, to the desktop, to the web: there's a React Native experience for you. 

In this talk I will go over the exciting developments 2020 has brought that makes this easier and go over the different platforms you can target with React Native. I will also share case studies for companies that have successfully made this work!
