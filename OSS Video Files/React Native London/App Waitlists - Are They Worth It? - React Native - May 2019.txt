so my name is Paul Reve I work for Clio

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:50,100
and I have been working with the app

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,480
team to build and up in react native but

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,430
before we get into it can I get show

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,670
hands as to who's downloaded an app and

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,949
been put on a wait list I know their

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:04,650
money oh yeah if you any of them free

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:07,110
trade I gave you a code yeah doing what

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:12,180
do you find it enjoyable you found they

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:16,049
enjoyable the animations you thought you

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,280
liked that the anticipation well you're

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,040
gonna love it this is gonna be great

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,619
this is girly like really really good so

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,130
if you won't pull up on the experience

00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:28,140
then you probably kind of got you know

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,220
kind of excited by the anticipation of

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,439
the product you probably bought into or

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,259
bought yourself off the wait list by did

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,380
you do that did you refer a friend you

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,520
you email customers well I did that a

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,259
free trade and they let me on yeah

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,610
that's fine but yeah you know you can

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,290
buy yourself off the wait list then you

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,640
can sort of maybe even pay money I don't

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,790
even know you can pay some social kind

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,229
of debt or something so I'm going to

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,119
talk to you today about the reasons that

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,219
you shouldn't implement a wait list and

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,930
the product over here the development

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,880
overhead and then I'm going to sort of

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,240
tell you as to why you should probably

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,069
do it anyway so the answer to the

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,429
question are they worth it is entirely

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,429
up to you

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,430
everything so over Cleo - Yvonne is

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,670
aware of clear but if you're not aware

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,830
of Cleo we have we will start up we've

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,520
been around for about two years we

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,230
provide we build a conversational a I to

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,020
help you with your money within those

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,180
two years or two to three years we now

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,870
have 1.2 million customers we've raised

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,630
25 million pounds in funding from some

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,180
of the euros best investors and we are

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:46,480
currently on boarding 30,000 people a

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,239
week which is super exciting up until I

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,390
know maybe six to nine months ago we

00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,220
were predominately on facebook Messenger

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,410
and we saw no reason to move from

00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,269
facebook messenger up until about nine

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,670
months ago and even then the decision

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,230
was that well shall we shouldn't we it's

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,550
a bit of a platform grace you realize

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,280
people don't really like facing their

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,630
own liking facebook Messenger nobody

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,950
likes facebook Messenger

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,360
I was looking at Facebook I mean

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,310
facebook Messenger which isn't Facebook

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,780
at all I kick it so within the we

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,440
started the Stars January in about eight

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,440
weeks we managed to release our MVP oh

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,320
sorry I keep forgetting there okay so if

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,880
anything I would say this talk is about

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,799
being lean and how to build your product

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,440
in a lean way I can't help that I work

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,110
in the product team at creo but we did

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,910
build our product in react native and

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,400
I'll touch a lot more on that later as

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,209
to why react native help helped us do

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,959
that we launched our app with the wait

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:56,799
list in place after around six releases

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,329
we got rid of the wait list so now

00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,769
anyone can get instant access which is

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:02,500
great how can see we will downloading it

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,209
now that's great but let's talk about

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,459
the lessons we've learned and I'd like

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:09,220
to start by talking about why a wait

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,450
list is of terrible thing maybe not

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:16,350
terrible I've ever aired it a little bit

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:16,350
I would say bad so

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,049
number one there should be four other

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:27,530
stars now that's supposed to be a one

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:29,480
star review anyway no I think it's

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,800
something weird anyway there are other

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,120
stars here once already this is a

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
legitimate review we got from the App

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,940
Store which is a wait list 700 sentences

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,950
in inline no thanks so regardless is

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,410
like however you look at the bad reviews

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,260
will come if you entice people to come

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,419
to your product and you chuck them like

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,370
you know number 800 and list they will

00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,930
hate it and they will tell you so there

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,610
is something massively gratifying and

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,350
easy and frictionless about leaving an

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,919
app review is anybody here left an app

00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,290
review is only here left a bad app

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:09,460
review as anyone here left the bad app

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:13,340
review for clear you guys I'm sorry

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:17,180
so how do we avoid this it's like it's a

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,190
tough one I think you can communicate a

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,630
lot easier as to why you have a wait

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,430
list I think people are very sympathetic

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,260
a lot of the customers and users that we

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,150
speak to are very empathetic to what

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,590
we're trying to do which is trying to

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,900
build something and iterate on it and

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,020
understand what their needs are in a

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,340
very lean way I'd also give them an idea

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,960
as to when they'll come off the wait

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,760
list if you just leave them there

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,020
so the people that went on the free

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,360
trade thing every time I checked into

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,410
the free trade thing I was going up when

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,550
it was sixteen thousand there's

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,680
seventeen thousand I thought you know

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,240
what sorry I won't bother and I just

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:56,870
waited until somebody gave me a list

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:59,389
like a code thing so the next anyone see

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,360
the bars you can see the brothers is it

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,440
just me yeah it's just me there are bars

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,470
there this is one of our charts is

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,470
amazing I went anyways says so trying to

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,820
trying to monitor engagement and

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,440
retention and stuff like that with a

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,400
wait list is very very difficult you

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,349
have people come through the door all

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,370
the time but they're on a wait list what

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:21,080
does that tell you about your product

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,190
like and their usage they check it once

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,450
a day to see if they're off the wait

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,490
list does that tell you anything told

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,220
you nothing if anything you get better

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,750
retention so that's good so I put that

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,980
in a number

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,120
and send it to my boss and he was like

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,120
that is absolutely amazing

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:42,910
the next thing I'm really sorry about so

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,050
the height I guess like the only the

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,000
biggest thing that I heard from my boss

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,050
was like hype you know let's just let's

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,370
get the hype you know you get these

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,350
people and everyone's like eyes and I've

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,610
got a thing for the thing and how can we

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,780
get into the thing and like we should do

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,660
think we should be the thing I was like

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,440
yeah great we can be the thing so we had

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:03,280
all the hype but to be honest with you

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,860
it takes a lot of effort to get that

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,210
kind of hype and to warrant that amount

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,100
of engineering time especially if you're

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,720
trying to be as lean as possible it's

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,270
like we're gonna spend two weeks doing

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,550
this thing so that we can get more hype

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,870
as these guys struggling to to hold so

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:23,230
yeah we kind of struggle with that a

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:26,830
little bit so I've told you some things

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:30,280
about waitlist aren't very good and what

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,660
we found challenging but I'd like to

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,440
talk to you a little bit about some of

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,330
the things that we found very useful and

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:43,540
by far the biggest thing that we found

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:45,900
useful about waitlist is you ready it

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,900
should be good

00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:52,759
yeah both go needs to see fantastic so I

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,699
would say there's one his platform

00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,219
confidence so building an app especially

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,560
brightly react native we have a react

00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:02,419
steam we very much we focus them towards

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,029
a react native thing the upskilling was

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:08,840
amazing the amount of momentum that we

00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:10,249
had was fantastic but we realized that

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,840
we had a platform to look after and we

00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,550
realized that we had absolutely no idea

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,449
as so ever this thing would fly and

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,069
where we would speak to our back in

00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,930
properly about the database would fall

00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,520
over and wherever that one Windows Phone

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,900
user would like do something and drop a

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,789
table accidentally you know we had no

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,949
idea if that would happen so why let a

00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:28,159
million people do it when you can let

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:32,539
one person do so we yeah we very much

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,860
enjoyed onboarding people slowly just to

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:41,229
see if our platform was kind of ready

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:43,519
for things which leads me on to this so

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,220
this is supposed to represent our

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,320
end-to-end journey for like our requests

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,350
coming in our HTTP requests I couldn't

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,970
find the icons so our HTTP requests go

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,769
through a cloud and then here jetski and

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,740
going to this bit this radiation thing

00:08:54,769 --> 00:09:02,149
this is Ruby on Rails right here I don't

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,310
mean to offend anybody but Leila so we

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:07,010
wanted to understand what that kind of

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:10,279
whole journey would look like and we

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,800
wrote a lot of entering tests as many as

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,360
we could as many as we felt able to

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,320
write how many end-to-end tests to be

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,180
write three excellent so we did our best

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,990
we trying to be lean you know is startup

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,079
web but it really really helped to get

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,060
say a hundred people into actually just

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,980
test the whole kind of system and see

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:37,810
how how far that went

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,810
which we found very very useful yeah

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,610
next thing is monitoring so these are

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,710
actual chance that we look at again I

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,150
won't tell you what they mean this is my

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,250
salary going down actually I don't know

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,260
what this I don't I don't actually know

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,910
what this one means but it's like we did

00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,820
something really well and then it

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,650
started going really badly or we did

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:05,340
what does it you know you know this one

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:06,450
means these these are people who love

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,190
our products these are people love it

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:13,350
more

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:15,720
so we yeah so two we set up a lot of

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,120
monitoring we practice contains delivery

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,390
we deploy a sort of five to ten times a

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,950
day and we monitor things constantly we

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,540
look at these things hourly daily weekly

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,400
monthly we look at these things all the

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,730
time we talk about them as a team on a

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,160
regular basis some of these sort of

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,480
flatlined when we released and we

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,940
thought why's that we realized that we

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,740
weren't actually logging the you know

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,080
the requests properly or we didn't have

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,480
the thing fully set up so if you release

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,470
it to your entire user base then you

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,090
have a bit of a problem because you

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,800
can't retrospectively go back and read

00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,280
track what people have done on what they

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,100
have said so it's quite interesting so

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,540
we let a few people through and we watch

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,430
these things kind of inflate and we

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:05,450
wanted to make sure and sense check that

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:05,450
these things made sense great

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,910
all right no this is great this is our

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,670
organic growth design one here work for

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,630
a starter is organic organic growth the

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,820
biggest thing you talk about all the

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,530
time you talk about your CPA going down

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,570
is it on CPA to hire are you gonna get

00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,550
fired up in my head because that's me

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,890
I'm gonna I think I fired TPI too high

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,570
we need to you know get that thing this

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,180
is actually our organic growth since we

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,130
released the app so I spoke earlier

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:37,240
about hype being a bit of a problem bit

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,910
tenuous a bit problematic but I can

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,510
agree is pretty exceptional and a lot of

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,130
that is to do with the wait list and we

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,590
had some early adopters who told early

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,710
adopters we have some people who hate

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:53,110
Facebook they tell people hey Facebook

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:55,150
they come to our app and happy day so

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,980
yeah we saw regardless of how much

00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,570
overhead that we saw an engineering and

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,390
product overhead and comms and stuff

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,440
like that we actually enjoy it a lot of

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,440
all kind of great for me so that's good

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:17,020
so I guess the big decision do we like

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:20,590
when this or not should you implement

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,150
them in a special decision I might point

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,910
out at this point that clear is a bit of

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:28,060
a different kind of landscape we have a

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,760
huge amount of users across the UK US

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,110
and Canada and we have a product that is

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,550
alive and kicking and growing

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,780
fantastically but we did this and we put

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,790
people on the wait list we have people

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,110
most loyal customers we put them on the

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,290
Rea list they were positioned about

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,820
10,000 do you think they like that no of

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,190
course they didn't do you think they

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,590
could sort see the products already of

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,530
course they could so we really struggled

00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,810
with like it not being a new product so

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:59,560
I guess our kind of situation is a

00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,700
little bit different but was it worth it

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,740
does they only think it's worth it

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,790
show of hands anyone think is worth

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,990
having a weightless nobody really know

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,500
anyone doesn't think is worth having

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:14,980
awareness nobody raises it

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,390
this is going so well so I would say yes

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,340
he's for having awareness just go for it

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:22,650
why not but it's is a complicated

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:27,160
victory I think we built a lean product

00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:28,510
we got to market really fast and we had

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,160
some bad reviews we have some people

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,050
that are really pissed off I think some

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,580
of them were weight listeners I think

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,140
some of them were people who just like

00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:41,700
being pissed off and slash pay our

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,700
product yeah that's my decision

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,310
last slide react native I'm not gonna

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,110
I'm not gonna talk massively about

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,190
native but I would say that we literally

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,280
wouldn't be able to do what we did

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,540
without react native I think the way

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,990
that we could refocus our team was

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,790
fantastic I think some of the biggest

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:05,020
challenges that we had you can speak to

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:08,370
ollie about this he's right now we some

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,540
of the things that we I don't know

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,030
switching to like a virgin' software

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,240
model for example was quite difficult

00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:17,950
release inversion software and catering

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,980
for people with software that wasn't

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,150
backwards compatible that was an issue

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,010
Shea components

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:28,080
has anyone managed to share components

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:30,400
from web to react native by successfully

00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,580
nobody I thought you guys were talking

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:37,030
about it just knows you you haven't all

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,560
you have what logic you said you see

00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:48,040
like read out shuffled sagas and things

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:49,630
or just you do yeah we sure like utility

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,430
functions but like nothing else I think

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,430
we tried it was really bad it took ages

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,540
react native web

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,850
that's like full circle Wow did you know

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,880
that exist something yeah we should look

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:11,279
into it

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,900
we at native web native code push we

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,510
cope literally saved there are a few

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,550
times we release some that was like

00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:20,580
really really bad and we got around it

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,529
instead of releasing a new version we

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,240
pushed a new bundle which is really

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:29,180
useful that was something that we really

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:33,680
enjoyed and I guess to summarize is

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,680
should you use a wait list for your app

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:44,390
no I would say probably should you use

00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,390
react native absolutely

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:52,249
