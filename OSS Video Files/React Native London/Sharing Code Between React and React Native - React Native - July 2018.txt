Title: Sharing Code Between React and React Native - React Native - July 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06
Playlist: React Native London
Description: 
	Presented by Ben Ellerby.

React and React-Native allow a learn once write anywhere paradigm. This is great, because one tech team can build both your web app and native mobile experience. The problem is developers hate writing things twice. There have been a couple of efforts to build a unifying technology to write an application once and have it work on both web and native. Yet this is not always the best approach. There is value in only sharing your business and state logic; keeping your render code separate.
