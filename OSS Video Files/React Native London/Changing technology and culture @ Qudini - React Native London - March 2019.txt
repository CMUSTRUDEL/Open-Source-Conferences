Changing a process or a technology stack within a company is never easy and there is always a lot to consider.
Journey with us as we reflect on the last 18 months where we identified a problem and resolved to fix it outweighing the long terms benefits over short term gains.
From discovery to research and proposal all the way to completion across 3 different products. We put language and platform biases aside and choose react-native to drive our business forward and it worked.
We think we learned a lot along the way and would love to share it with you.

About Pusher Sessions:

We're bringing the meetup to you. With Sessions, you can watch recordings of top-notch talks from developer meetups -- wherever and whenever you want.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.
