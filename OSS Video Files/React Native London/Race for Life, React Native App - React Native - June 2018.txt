so first of all let us say thanks to

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,649
Weiser for hosting us and for react

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,230
native Mia for accepting me to present

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,380
I'm a little bit nervous I don't do this

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,660
all the time this is an upscale for me

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,109
to present in front of you guys so

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,449
that's my name I'm the sole mobile

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,430
developer for Cancer Research UK and

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,090
I've been working on the race for life

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,080
app and I'm going to switch to the next

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,110
slide now so a bit about race for life

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,540
race for life is a women's only event

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,730
raising money for research into all 200

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:44,190
types of cancer so since cancer has been

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,010
running they've raised about 500 million

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,920
pounds to beat cancer sooner that's our

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,649
slogan and I could give you some more

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,920
stats on that a colleague of mine sent

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,370
me an email actually so for 2019 we've

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,600
got almost 400,000 signups for our race

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,010
for life events and we've got around 450

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,110
race for life events

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:13,229
just this year in 2018 and so this year

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,600
is our 25th year running so it's pretty

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,170
good very good figure two hundred and

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,650
fifty thousand pounds so why did we

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,759
decide to build our app in react native

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,619
so we initially had an app

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,450
we had the app before this one which was

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,200
also a race for life and it was built by

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:37,740
a third-party agency and it wasn't react

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,420
native it was Objective C and Java and

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,850
it was very hard to maintain an

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,159
expensive course it was handled by an

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,390
external agency every time we had to do

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,590
an update I had to go over to their

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,939
office and help with all the deployment

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,369
stuff the certificates and the

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,200
provisioning profiles and all of that so

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,259
that was a bit of a time-consuming

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,049
process so we decided to take this

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,450
in-house and build it ourselves

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,960
and we wanted to have one code base not

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,349
too so we shopped around we came across

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,030
react native and it seemed an obvious

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,640
choice basically to

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,940
built a in react native and have one

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,450
played bass managed so yeah with native

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,450
was the choice

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:28,410
so this is our stuck at the moment we

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,180
use react native Redux saga firebase for

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,720
our environments and continuous

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,310
integration and our push notifications

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,360
Drupal is our CMS back-end

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:42,390
we've gone API endpoint we host our

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,690
content on Drupal and the app and reads

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,530
from that and displays the content in we

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:54,860
are symphony for our REST API to let

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:57,420
users link their pages from their app

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,610
their fundraising pages which are hosted

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,440
in our fundraising platform so yeah so

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,730
we use App Center to deploy our apps and

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,420
all the environments are on their

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:14,730
continuous integration and our tests run

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:17,160
as we deploy so I works on this I'm

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,840
fairly new to react native and I've been

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,269
working with a very experienced

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,420
developer which we hired as a contractor

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,890
for three months so I was a hit a

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,420
learning curve learning we had native

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:32,160
and now assume which was a contractor

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,890
has it's not working with us anymore

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,709
he's contacting turn end so I've been

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:43,410
taken over the app of released three

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:45,690
updates since he's left so I can now

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,140
show you the demo the app hopefully this

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,109
will work

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:53,489
yeah so that's what the app looks like

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:55,680
on your phone we launched it I'm going

00:03:53,489 --> 00:04:00,570
to close it so you get to see our slide

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:03,989
show so we have a little slideshow here

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,640
you get started your then a user would

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,519
link their own fundraising page so that

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,980
app so they can either paste the URL of

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,329
their fundraising page one person

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,760
someone that would have a fundraising

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:20,669
page would hopefully be familiar with

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:23,280
this or they can enter their the ending

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,710
of the URL so this is still working

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,310
progress but it's

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:32,470
still pretty usable so you would link

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,960
your the fundraising page that's an

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,270
example page with creatives so if anyone

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,120
wants to download the app you can enter

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:44,740
that into the search field and you'll be

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,870
able to link an account so it will tell

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,509
you hello where the name is in this case

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,320
is Ari you can see the event that they

00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:55,509
doing or if you don't know your URL and

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,229
this is not your page you enter the the

00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:01,990
wrong URL we would then search for your

00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:06,490
page here which then opens the web view

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:12,280
and connects to our CMS which lets you

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:13,720
search your pages so your page would

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,599
come up here you would scroll find the

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,270
relevant one one that we're looking for

00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:21,300
is the first one you click on it you can

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,759
see the writer the fundraising page

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,099
click on use this page then it allows

00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,590
you to link up your account when you

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:32,949
enter the app push notifications are

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:37,990
unable to users can stay up to date with

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:39,789
their donations and be able to thank the

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,720
friends and family or anyone that

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:46,780
donates of their pages so this is a

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,510
dashboard a countdown to your event so

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,909
it'll raise and we've also created a

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,919
work a dynamic training plan for them to

00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:56,349
get ready for the race for Life event so

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,580
it's very exciting I love you when free

00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:00,970
user testing and a lot of users were

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,880
happy with that you to see your

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,520
fundraising pages share your shirts say

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,979
thanks on donations so these would be

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,949
other nations if you're a member of a

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:14,979
team you would see your team donations

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,260
here in total but our account is not

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,659
currently a member of a team so it tells

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:24,159
you it gives you the option to join the

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:26,710
team ideas on how to fundraise training

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:29,919
plan so you've got your training plan

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,810
you can select from if you're not that

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,880
fit you can you know select a beginner

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,180
or an intermediate they vary the

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,469
training plans vary on based on the

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,370
event that you're doing stuff if it's a

00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:41,470
5k

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,760
or a pretty muddy you'll get different

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:48,220
options you might have run walk jog

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,949
options but for a 10k you've got

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,960
beginning intermediate so then this is

00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:56,169
going off to our CMS getting a training

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,490
plan that's hosted on there and brings

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:03,370
it onto the app and you can go and start

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:07,570
taking off your training plan add the

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:11,770
new comments that you want save it

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,120
that'll be there if you want to change

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,030
your training plan you can still do that

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,220
if you think beginners too easy for you

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:23,080
can switch to intermediate and yeah so

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,690
obviously we'll currently will lose your

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,200
progress if you do change but that's

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,280
still working progress on the day so you

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,289
get under the information about your

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,720
event course information meeting point

00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:37,660
travel information accessibility

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,530
facilities and all of that you can view

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:45,520
your event and a Maps app that you might

00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:49,570
have on your phone you then get a quick

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,010
glance of where is a checklist on on the

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,910
day what you need to bring and what you

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,830
need to do on that day and settings

00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,780
you've got notification preferences

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,940
terms of conditions information about

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,979
the app I'm just going to show this

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,490
screen quickly that's all the people

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:10,450
have worked on the app you don't have to

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,919
read them and yeah that's it you can

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:19,000
unlink your account if you want to link

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:21,970
a new one you start over and so on so

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,479
I'll switch back to my slides if I can

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,479
find the mouse

00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:31,710
so other apps we've done in react native

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:36,300
is the following one upon mu nodules

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:39,630
which is used by the British thoracic

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,240
society which is a risk I permit Nigel

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,579
risk calculator currently used by over

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,350
4000 clinicians that was my first ever

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:51,449
react native app just purely react

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:53,100
native build using Expo and I didn't use

00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:55,949
any I didn't use Redux I didn't use

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,680
sagas I didn't use I just pure react

00:08:55,949 --> 00:09:00,389
native so that was my starting point

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,750
West I don't react native and then moved

00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,670
on to the race for life race for life up

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:10,709
so yeah it's been a learning curve for

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:12,839
me and that's a basically it's a simple

00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:15,810
show-and-tell yeah I also wanted to

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,120
mention also wanted to mention that it's

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:21,720
not confirmed there so it can I say this

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:26,490
of course in September we've done in to

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,529
host a react native me up officer office

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,610
in angel into building Cancer Research

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:35,060
UK so keep an eye out for that and make

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,060
sure you come

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,100
