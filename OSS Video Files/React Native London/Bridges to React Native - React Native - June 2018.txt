A great strength of React Native is how easily we can interface our app with native code.
In this talk, Iâ€™m going to explain the lifecycle of a native module, how calls are made over the bridge and how to bootstrap your native modules.
I'll present various tools, either native or specific to React Native, that are useful when creating a native modules and will finish by a few pitfalls to avoid.
