Publication date: 2019-03-11

Description: 
	Robbie Heygate at Birdie

It's no secret that speed is key in start ups. At Birdie, we were chanting "More Features!" so regularly you could set your watch to it. With no real safety net however, we initially saw the impact this had on the confidence we had in releasing our product. There was a paralysis in our production with doubtful deployments at the heart of it. With Typescript however, we were able to ramp up the robustness of our product and release routinely! In this talk I will cover how we went about doing this.

About Pusher Sessions:

We're bringing the meetup to you. With Sessions, you can watch recordings of top-notch talks from developer meetups -- wherever and whenever you want.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.

If you run a meetup and want to get involved, kindly get in touch.
