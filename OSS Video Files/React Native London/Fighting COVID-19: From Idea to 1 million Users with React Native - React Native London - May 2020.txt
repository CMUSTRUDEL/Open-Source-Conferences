Title: Fighting COVID-19: From Idea to 1 million Users with React Native - React Native London - May 2020
Publication date: 2020-05-18
Playlist: React Native London
Description: 
	Fighting COVID-19: How ZOE went from idea to 1 million users in less than a week with React Native - by Julien (https://twitter.com/julienlavigne) and Mike (https://twitter.com/isofarro)

ZOE is the healthcare startup behind the COVID Symptom Tracker, an app helping scientists and authorities understand the symptoms and spread of the virus. More than 3M people participated in this citizen science project, leading to the publication of several research papers and discoveries at https://covid.joinzoe.com/blog.

The COVID Symptom Tracker is the first React Native app released by the ZOE engineering team. In this talk, they will share their experience adopting RN, the challenges they faced and whether they believe this choice was the right one in this context.

	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,730
hi everyone today I want to talk about

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,040
the covered symptom study app and

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,990
especially how at zuy we went from

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,960
having very little experience of react

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,839
native to shipping an app used by more

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,410
than 1 million people in about these

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,410
days so this talk is really a case study

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,150
we not expert in react native but we

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,430
want to show me your journey what we

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,680
learned what worked well and why we

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,300
think that ultimately that was a good

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,500
decision for us to build that up with

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,440
react native so Who am I my name is

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,800
Julien I'm VP of engineering at Zoe and

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,840
my co-speaker today will be Mike Davis

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,300
Mike will join us for the Q&A but I will

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,460
do the talk myself and Mike is a

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:53,000
software engineer does one one of the

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,860
main person behind VI in your app so Zoe

00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,050
before working in a give it symptom

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:03,870
study app we are after all a nutritional

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,610
science company and basically we're in a

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,610
mission to try to help people to hit

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,729
with confidence and the tropic you can

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,590
see here is very interesting because the

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,290
last two years we've basically done a

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,750
lot of nutritional study and one thing

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,659
we found out is that all of us were very

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,850
very differently to food so in that case

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,860
we're measuring the blood sugar response

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,500
which is the level of sugar you have in

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,079
your blood after eating a meal and you

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,979
can see there is almost like a hateful

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,619
difference between the people at the

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,430
bottom and the people at the very top

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,860
and so that's the core of what Zoe has

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,630
been building for the last couple of

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,049
years and so fondly

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:50,030
we believe that food is the most

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,259
important important medicine we take and

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,290
we're building a product around that

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,250
that should be relatable to people later

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,790
in the year and we also basically that

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,350
the world HS traditional science program

00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,969
about measuring respond to food and

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,879
we've been working with a lot of people

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,619
and that is actually quite relevant for

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,030
the work with date very simply with

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,350
their common symptoms that yeah

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,710
so I've been working with people with

00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,720
from kcl Harvard Stanford massage

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,260
section general hospitals and twins

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,260
yukia

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:30,520
so that brings me to the covet symptom

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,740
study app so for those of you that never

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,950
heard of it um it's an app that was

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,010
released about two months ago primarily

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,160
in the UK and the US intense we don't

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,770
and principle are very very simple we

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,930
ask you to report your symptoms on a

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,820
daily basis and whether you're feeling

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,470
well or in the world and if you're

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,330
feeling unwell we ask you quite a lot of

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,820
questions about what kind of symptoms

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,610
you have are you coughing do you have

00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,610
fever if do you have a hoarse voice have

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,830
you lost the sense of smell and

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:06,160
basically that information is collected

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,230
and we've got a lot of people are

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,540
participating in this science project

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,090
basically so this information is

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,220
collected and then sent for analysis

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,120
both by teams and Tumulty so it also

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,170
teams at kacl MGH another University

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,030
another information is also now

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,390
disseminated to the government to the

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,930
authorities to the NHS and there has

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:31,299
been extremely useful for understanding

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,310
better the coughing symptoms and we made

00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:34,720
some very interesting discoveries about

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,739
what are the symptoms that predict

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,750
whether you have kavita not but also

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,750
just understanding that the spread of

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,430
the virus this project basically all

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:50,290
started as I said that two months ago

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:53,500
and team Inspector which is also one of

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,590
the founders of Zuri is Professor of

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,980
Jenny of genetic epidemiology at King's

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,220
College and working for something called

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,090
twins UK and twins UK is actually the

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:09,040
biggest database of twins in the UK

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,500
twins are quite interesting because

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,510
basically they want you to analyze

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,820
genetic factors so you can compare up

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,650
people you know how twins react

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,739
different things and in our case we're

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,750
working with him on the nutrition side

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,680
of things

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,160
so about two months ago basically

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,110
reached out to us and

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,510
since twins UK was going to be shut down

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,150
for lockdown and started to ask us soon

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,870
could you build an app for us for

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,580
understanding a bit better covered 19

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:42,090
you know works and and we could use

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:45,330
between registry as a way to learn

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,640
something very very specific about about

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,260
comment that other people could could

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,280
not do so

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,960
yeah sure we would really love to help

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,970
reelect everybody else in the same boat

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,120
with coverage so if there is something

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,250
we can do you know let's try to do that

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,420
great and then Tim asked us to do could

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,260
I have this app you know literally

00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,650
tomorrow evening which you know say okay

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,600
let's let's give it a try

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,040
so obviously generally you would take in

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,940
a weeks or months to build an app like

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,650
that but we've covered 19 you know we

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,010
don't have that time so we really need

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,570
to really needed to to feel something

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,390
extremely quickly and that's basically

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,160
how this project started and this

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,650
project that started me surely with just

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,350
building in that for the 15,000 people

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,810
or part of the twin rich history quickly

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,120
became well actually this app could work

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,980
for everybody so we should release it to

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,410
the general public and you know if there

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,800
is an uptake great if there is not then

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,080
you know that's not too bad we've tried

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,540
so we've assembled the team at that

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,720
point which was you know kind of a

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,240
Katherine style we had to react native

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,820
engineers or him from 10 or kind of

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,490
because one of those was myself and I'm

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,830
actually have not been writing a lot of

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,830
code for last few years and certainly

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,230
have not been writing anymore by that to

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,760
back end engineers both working on the

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:15,060
you know actual code for the back end

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,680
but infrastructure to run run it one

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,540
product designer is coming up with all

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,060
the design for the screen and thinking

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,210
about the flow and our CEO transferred

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,980
wolf was also very involved both in the

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,380
flow but also in occurring all the legal

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,440
aspect which are very complicated for a

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,410
product like that so we had symbol LED

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,450
team on the 19th of March which was

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,570
basically when we've discussed this idea

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:43,980
with team and KCl

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:47,040
and we started at lunchtime and as I

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,100
said the goal was to have enough working

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,290
literally in 36 hours later one of the

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,120
reason we wanted to go fast is as I said

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,130
because you know covered 19 cannot wait

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,110
also because we were anticipating that

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:02,490
getting it through the store review

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:05,730
process would be and be difficult so in

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,220
about 36 hour we actually had the first

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,870
app I think we've pushed it towards

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,520
midnight on the Friday night and we you

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,950
know went through the store submission

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,900
process and quickly we find out that I

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,780
know Google and Apple were also in a bad

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,180
situation we've come in 19 and therefore

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:28,440
you know the time they needed to review

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,880
was upwards of one week so that didn't

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,800
work for us so we actually spent a lot

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,470
of time during the weekend normally you

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,270
know adding features but also you know

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,450
reaching out for a network and trying to

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,580
get through the approval process

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,370
especially everything covered 19 related

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,860
is quite control and those platform with

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,540
you know good reasons so you know we had

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,720
to do quite a lot of paperwork with

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,270
Casey else you know prove to them that

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,660
this project was actually you know a

00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:00,420
real research project with thick

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,510
approval which is needed for any kind of

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:06,030
service research and basically on the

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:09,240
Monday we finally got our approval and

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,210
we're ready to launch next day so next

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,250
day we've launched at about 9:00 a.m.

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,820
mostly by team reaching out his network

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,160
and tweeting and the thing just valuing

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,130
during the day and by the end of the day

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,340
we had about 200,000 people using the

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,420
app the next day at about 8 a.m. in the

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:33,150
morning or back end kind of blew up

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:35,580
under under load because there was just

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,800
too many people trying to sign up at the

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,750
press in general caught up with the ID

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,460
and by the end of the day we had about 1

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:48,270
million users yeah a few days later we

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:50,910
launched in the US a lot smaller scale

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,350
but still well afford to do and still

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,870
very available

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,300
then we do we release like a lot of

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,990
additional features to the app some of

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,759
those work a few UX improvement a lot of

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,070
those were adding new questions because

00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,500
our understanding is evolving constantly

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,720
it's basically every every week we had a

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,500
set of new questions whether they're

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,759
about your symptoms or medical stories

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,139
and then more recently we launched in

00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,569
Sweden Sweden is quite an interesting

00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:21,870
country because they didn't have any

00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:24,360
lockdown I'm so comparing comparing the

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,480
stats between you know you can be in

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,220
Sweden might be very interesting and

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,980
then in parallel to that there was

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,680
obviously a lot of research done by you

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,279
know great team at both KCl and Zoey

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,889
enough places and that culminated very

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,040
recently to a research paper published

00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:47,519
in Nature Medicine which is in one of

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:52,529
the best you know science journals out

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:55,110
there so has been a very exciting

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:57,029
journey and you know the team at Zoe and

00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,910
and Casey have been like extremely busy

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:03,180
working around the clock to normally

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,130
support you know the app launch new

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:10,620
feature but also can't be a promote

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:12,980
attend to the research and around it but

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,000
yeah to go back to my initial point

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,639
something that is really really unique

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,769
to this app I don't think it was

00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,459
actually that many times that we

00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:26,100
literally went from a 92 and that views

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,889
by 1 million users in less than a week

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,389
and so their exciting journey

00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:37,889
not without a rollercoaster of emotions

00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:40,230
so today we have about 3.5 million users

00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:42,420
at the time of recording and more than 1

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,630
million users or reporting their

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,779
symptoms daily we're publishing daily

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,089
map of the virus every day on our

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,819
website so you can know how the UK is

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,819
doing we're doing similar things in the

00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:59,639
US and Sweden but that's just not not

00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:01,470
publishing better daily as I mentioned

00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,110
we've got like quite a few research

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,440
papers that have got published some of

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,300
the main discovery that were

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,810
main is that coffin fever I should be

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,030
just one of symptoms that could you know

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,470
tell you you've got covered actually I

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,990
think there is about six different

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,150
groups of symptoms and one of the most

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:23,560
interesting one is actually in Austria

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:25,300
which is the loss of smell or test this

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,580
is the one symptoms that predict better

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,290
whether you have covered so about 2/3 of

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,260
the people that have come from commit

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,820
actually have lost smell or taste so if

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,690
you were one of those people definitely

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,280
time to go and see your your your doctor

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,470
and then last month rules have got you

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,120
endorsed by NHS Scotland and Wales that

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,180
are totally encouraging the population

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,680
to use the app to report their symptoms

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,050
not only for research but also because

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,810
it's a great tool for understanding the

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,260
spread of the virus so that you can you

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,800
know prepare the hospital's better and

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,540
that's logically relevant because we are

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,660
leading indicators versus spittle

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,150
emissions so are the numbers of people

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,430
we think F come it would increase first

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:13,360
in our stats then in the hospital

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:16,150
admission which stop - to increase - and

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,500
then sadly you know a couple of weeks

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:23,770
later death so we're very happy with

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:28,090
with all of that stuff so that brings me

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:30,430
to you know Zoey in react negative so

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,250
for us to pre-commit era the kind of

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,070
project we're doing we're on nutrition's

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:39,250
and we had two apps one was used for

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:41,980
managing or studies so something that

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,560
study participant would use to report to

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,390
lock their meals that would be some kind

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,400
of you know title test list so that you

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,460
know we tell them on that day they need

00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,050
to do those things because being part of

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,940
study is like a very specific and

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,610
protocol and we've got a second half

00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:01,030
that is more about showing some kind of

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,310
result based on the test you did we can

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,920
tell you you know how some how good some

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,530
food would be for you personally and so

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,680
ii have really about nutrition food and

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:16,900
and informing you and those two apps

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,180
were developed for native one in swift

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,550
one in Kathleen

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,820
so that's basically for cup base this

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:26,130
had one one big problem which is a very

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,890
low bus factor obviously a lot of rework

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,630
but also like a flexibility in the sense

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,339
when you just have one engineer that can

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,260
do the work on what platform you know if

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,140
you want to really push forward one of

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,790
the other if you just want to go faster

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,279
it's not that easy and we've certainly

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,470
found that getting you know a non-mobile

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,570
engineer to learn mobile environments

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,670
with swift opening is not like an easy

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,250
task and so I actually had Oren do it

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,900
engineer that started working on Swift

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:56,190
to kind of speed up the development over

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:58,680
iOS and yeah that definitely took him

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,660
several weeks to stop being reaching

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,430
point where it was able to work by

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:07,680
himself so that led us to to think about

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,300
react native and basically we contacted

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,430
started to conduct an experiment which

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,560
was you know can we rewrite or Andreea

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,300
with react native and the reason we

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,060
chose our under adapt is because at some

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,520
point as I said or Android engineers

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,740
switch to an iOS because we wanted to go

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,510
faster in iOS because there was no point

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,339
having two apps being exactly the same

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,560
we were basically not running twice as

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,650
much so we've decided to bet everything

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,060
on iOS just do it right faster so at

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:37,529
that point you know the Android version

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:39,089
was lagging quite significantly so we

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,610
decided to run that experiment with two

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,310
developers or in the wind engineers

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,709
which was loading a third platform and

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:49,020
another engineers at joining us a couple

00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,940
of weeks before that and had a bit of

00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,890
experience with a right- having worked

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,630
with it for for a year as a sole

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,670
developer and the goal was to work for

00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,850
about six weeks and see how far we could

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,830
go with rebuilding the app and

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,390
officially learn about you of what is

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,730
easy and what is hearts not just you

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,709
know beauty app as is but trying to see

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:11,130
what would be kind of the things that

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:12,900
would bite us ultimately over that was

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,120
great and basically at that point we

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,890
were three weeks into the experiment you

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,690
know we've basically aborted it just

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,510
because we've switched everybody to be

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,520
careful Kovach symptom study yeah so and

00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,350
at that point we would choose react

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,140
medium because there was no way we would

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,790
be able to field an iOS version a

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,560
coughing version of common symptom study

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,990
yet in 36 hours

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,550
that was just not not achievable so we

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,930
know based on our experience we were

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,520
quite convinced that we could build

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,890
something quite quickly we've read

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,150
native that would work cross-platform

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,980
obviously was like a massive bet because

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,160
we just didn't had any production

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,279
experience with it but you know embrace

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,610
dudes and you know we try to just you

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:56,160
know take the pain road so no use Expo

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,290
with the manage workflow types through

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,000
because that's something we're using in

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,040
our experiment too and we're quite Stern

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,890
opinionated about the fact that's having

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,070
some static typing was something worth

00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:11,130
doing react native navigation negative

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,410
base components forming for managing

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,420
forms and a few other libraries I think

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,270
one of the key things there that we did

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,250
is just we didn't try to find what was

00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,860
the best solution for each of those

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,720
basically picked you know the most

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,900
obvious one like you know almost a first

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,520
search in Google search results because

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,460
we just didn't that time right we just

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,230
needed to move super fast so just took

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,800
whatever we're playing with for

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:40,230
experiment not trying to double guess

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,950
what was the best solution what went

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,230
well

00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,520
we've we've you know this small

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,070
experience well the first thing is that

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,710
we shipped like super fast as I said in

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,960
36 hour we had a first version it was

00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:55,110
not great by any means but we we did had

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,700
a first version of the app and we did

00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,680
take a lot of shortcuts like the first

00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,970
version of yeah that was published a few

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,890
days later for example didn't had

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,630
password reset it was like something

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,420
that was definitely missing and

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,670
requested by a lot of people the other

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,040
thing that went very well is that you

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,439
know when when you learn about react

00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,699
native you must be interested by your

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,620
shared code base and our experience has

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,000
been yes we've shared almost everything

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,100
in two copies there's a few places where

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,740
there is a need for Android on iOS but

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,270
that's very very minimal and that's

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,420
super important because we don't have a

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,920
great QA process so I'm you know being

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,660
able to have this kind of shared code

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,080
base and mostly the books that you're

00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,850
gonna have they're going to the to is

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,220
extremely useful so we still have some

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,950
rendering differences between iOS and

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,290
Android but they tend to be you know on

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,150
the margin not something absolutely used

00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,490
and it's pretty easy for

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,320
us to you know actually detect us and

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,590
fix us and the third thing that went

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,140
very well is importing web developers so

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,790
you know literally we had two engineers

00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,190
that were familiar with react that never

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,960
done any mobile engineering before and

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,460
we asked them to stop working the

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,890
co-pays 24 hours later they were

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,380
productive and that's that really

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,940
amazing and that's in the context or

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,260
cell phone of the other people working

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,290
on the companies were themselves not

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,450
experts right so it's it's really easy

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,190
for someone knowing react to switch to

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,360
writing react negative if we zoom a bit

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,610
unlike school the other thing that

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,530
worked very well or over the Europe days

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,210
that was actually one of the reason

00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:28,260
we're also considering react native for

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:32,070
a nutrition lab and that saved us many

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,940
many times notifications set up was

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,890
super simple we forgot about FCM set up

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,480
initially and Android but when find out

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,730
about that took us just you know a

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,370
couple of hours to set it up and that

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,260
was very convenient because again Expo

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,390
gives you an abstraction and you can

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,890
basically reach and do it and I was very

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:54,990
easily through that mechanism and and we

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,240
still haven't need to check from explore

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,679
even two months later so there's

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,990
probably a point at which we'll need to

00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,120
do that but actually Expo is covering a

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,240
lot of feature and that makes a life a

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,690
lot easier but there are some things we

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,700
struggle with so I think one of the key

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,470
problem we have is that we still not

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,170
sure two months later when is good react

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,420
native and you know we basically took a

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,280
lot of shortcuts we trying to ship an

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,900
app as quickly as possible and there's

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,150
definitely things we know probably

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,760
didn't do well so for example one of the

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,280
debates we you know we didn't have

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,990
Norman starting to have is whether we

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,750
should use books or not so we started

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,210
without hooks just with class components

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,650
and you know we didn't realize after the

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,720
fact that actually the wall coming T is

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,670
moving towards hook so that's probably

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,670
something we should stop integrating in

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,800
orkut base another thing that we can

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:50,250
struggle with is you know how to stall

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,840
and reuse components so we tend to have

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,020
you know style sheets are recreated for

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,850
every single screen and complementary is

00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,780
quite quite small so again that's

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,740
definitely some best

00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:04,920
is there that we did not fall and last

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,780
thing is carefully ICD setup so the nice

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,430
thing about over-the-air updates is that

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,590
you know they exist and you can push an

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,230
update without doing negative bills but

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:18,180
also makes you will you know process a

00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:21,000
lot harder that to set up and it wasn't

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,980
clear to us at the beginning you know

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,660
when we needed to do over the air

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,720
updates versus when we needed to push

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,080
new native bills again if we zoom in on

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,870
specific cities of Expo so over-the-air

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,030
updates are amazing but the defaults are

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,310
not basically what you want so for

00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:39,990
example the default is basically the M

00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,000
they would be a synchronous on startup

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,470
but if you want to connect new strongly

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,030
encourage people to use the latest

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,590
version of your app and if your app like

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,510
you know ours is basically something

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,030
that you use only once a day you

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,460
probably want to make it sink reduce on

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,080
startup at least to some degree so we

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,970
change that but it took us you know a

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,850
few weeks to really understand what was

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:02,400
the update behavior and credential

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,100
management for the ICD through Explorer

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,380
at some point was just entirely broken

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,310
and they fix it and have been extremely

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,280
responsive but that really slowed us

00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:14,010
down and we just struggle as far of the

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,290
automation and another I mentioned you

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,210
know one of the big question we were

00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,860
asking yourself is when do you actually

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,660
need a native really so the

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,810
documentation on export was not entirely

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,950
clear now we understand it a bit better

00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,630
but there's also some other

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,730
consideration which is actually quite

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,890
nice to push a new native peel because

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,700
that means you you're kind of you're

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:39,030
guaranteed to soften on state for for

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,800
people are installing the app whereas if

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,000
you don't force update and startup you

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,490
know they could still have a version

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,990
from a couple of weeks ago with maybe

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,430
not all the questions that you're now

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,410
asking there are definitely things we

00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,380
did not explore that we feel are quite

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:55,770
important so animations is definitely

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,570
something we did not invest in but it's

00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,800
you know pretty clear from our

00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,940
experience that you can have a pixel

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,890
perfect UI

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,000
and we have some screen directional you

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,890
know I wouldn't say they are beautiful

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,070
but they're certainly not your plus

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,330
equal Android or iOS components and

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,669
everything related to native integration

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,519
not something that we had to do as I say

00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:17,890
we're still using the export manage

00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,610
workflow so some of things that also

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:23,559
surprised us was that actually record it

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,080
works like obviously you know Facebook

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,990
would not use it if it did not work but

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,269
we're a bit worried that you know I

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,669
scale you would have a lot of HP's a lot

00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:34,840
of issues and actually that mostly

00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,750
doesn't happen so you've got three

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,210
million devices are using your app and

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,620
you know or crush weights is actually

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,220
super reasonable and you know I've

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:48,760
talked to people you know working at

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,590
Google Play for example to confirm how

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,470
we benchmark against the other apps and

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:56,289
it's actually quite good so something

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,419
definitely quite quite happy shortcut

00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:59,799
Bayes was always an objective but there

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,750
was always this doubt that you know

00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,029
whether you can have a lot of if-else

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,010
statement and actually there it is not

00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:09,490
and the third thing that is actually

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:12,070
very important is not more top issues

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,929
are related to negative you know we were

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,000
wondering whether we would end up in a

00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:17,740
situation where something doesn't work

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,870
or you know lots of edge cases and

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,269
actually no the big problem we have or

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:25,600
you know our UX is not good some

00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:27,970
features needs improvement or backends

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,159
sometimes it's not stable because we've

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,960
got students traffic spike like nothing

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,639
is fundamentally related to react native

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,419
there's nothing so far that was like

00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:41,110
totally blocking so anyway thank you

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:44,350
very much for for listening to our story

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,059
and we'll take Q&A there's a few things

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,399
I want to share with you before for

00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:51,100
living which is hey you can contribute

00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:53,559
to the cup base we've made it open

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,080
source so please give us a hand if you

00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:58,029
feel that that's important and we'll do

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,740
our best to integrate all those full

00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:01,840
requests but we're still not great at

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,080
managing open source project but we're

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,330
learning so please is help and we're

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,370
looking for people to help us you know

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,860
building that happen not just on the pro

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:14,049
bono basis but actually be part of zoe

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,260
and we're both on this product and

00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:18,850
nutrition product so thank you very much

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,039
download the app if you're not already

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:23,140
self reporting because that's important

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,080
that's helping the NHS and

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,260
dancing the science have a good day

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,260
