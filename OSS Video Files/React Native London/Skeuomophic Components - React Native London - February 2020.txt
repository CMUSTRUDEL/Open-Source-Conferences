Description: 
	Having Fun With React Native - by Paul McCabe

Many of us develop apps for a living, and often these are serious business tools. But sometimes, when we have a little time, we can instead have some fun with this wonderful framework, doing some off-key, entertaining, sometimes even helpful things on the side! This talk is about some of the fun I had with React Native in 2019, including making my own skeuomorphic controls, making fun sounds and some Augmented Reality...

hopefully this will be something just a

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,799
little bit different and something you

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,420
don't often see at these meetups but

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,070
we'll start the beginning who is this

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,969
going why should I listen to him my name

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,470
is Paul I am currently a react native

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,210
engineer working for a company called

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,880
Ana plan I've been doing native there

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,740
for about a year and a half but my

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,779
background is mainly in kind of

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,630
server-side Java and that kind of thing

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,300
so I'm fairly new to react native but

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,070
I've been a JavaScript evangelist for

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,559
one of the better words in my own spare

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,100
time for a long time and I'd really love

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,950
working the language and this is my cat

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,570
Salomon more about him later in the talk

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,760
and that he does come up so I want to

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,020
talk about a few topics today it's just

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,300
things that I've played around with in

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,789
my spare time over the last year because

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,199
a lot of what we do and a lot of what a

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,230
lot of the engineers here who work and

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,230
make me to do is get paid to write apps

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,030
for businesses and you know there's a

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,670
lot of forms there's a lot of sharing

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,290
graphs of energy usage and other things

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,820
which is really useful and we can make

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,880
that really entertaining and interactive

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,939
but there's there's so much more that we

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,430
can do with this and you know this

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,650
library of this ecosystem and a lot of

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,990
it can be a bit of fun and I want to

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,670
kind of dive back to a little bit of

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,729
mobile history and talk about

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,950
skeuomorphic components quickly so a

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:32,369
quick recap of what what is skeuomorphic

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,500
what does that mean weird word it is

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,020
when something in software mimics a

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,939
real-life object and the reason why you

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,000
saw a lot of stuff about this a few

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,649
years ago was when the iPhone came out

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,810
when the iPad came out and things like

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,060
that there was a resurgence of using

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,220
skeuomorphic design to convince people

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,740
who knew how to use you know a real life

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,110
radio that they could use one on this

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,880
weird flat pane of glass because it

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,229
looked kind of similar there was a knob

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,270
there that they could turn and that

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,860
would change the radio station that they

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,079
were dialing into and things like that

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,899
so really useful for migrating people

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,360
into this concept and and that concepts

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,459
has been used before so if we jump back

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,340
to cut some of the early desktop

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,190
computers things like

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,720
the trashcan that you see on the desktop

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,220
of you know Mac or a Windows PC that was

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,870
there because you know they wants to say

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,550
this is how you delete files you

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,970
literally drag them over there and throw

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,500
them into the trash can

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,569
but nowadays we don't see this kind of

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,280
thing very much because flat kind of

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,690
designs are taken over people know how

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,849
to use tablets people know how to use

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,180
smartphones so there's no need to have

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:44,160
that skeuomorphic element anymore and it

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,360
does get in the way it does cause a lot

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,870
more clutter because there's a lot more

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,370
design to it but you know that's quite

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,000
nice that's quite elegant and there is

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,769
an elegance to it and some fun as well I

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,810
remember when I was a kid on my Mac plus

00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,160
I installed an add-in that made Oscar

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,799
the Grouch jump out of the trash can

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,900
whenever I threw something away Q you

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,430
know eight-year-old me making empty

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,440
files and throwing them away just to see

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,760
you this little Grouch happen so you can

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,500
have some fun with it and really inspire

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:16,170
people to kind of think about things in

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:18,510
a different way so I wanted to use some

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,760
skeuomorphic design in an app and I kind

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,859
of went around this the backwards way I

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,730
went what kind of an app can I do that

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:28,739
would use some fun components and I play

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,600
tabletop games with giant clanking

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,600
robots that little models that run

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,160
around on the table and I wanted to make

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,079
an app for me and my friends so that

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,489
whenever one of these planking robots

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,049
would kind of charge at one of the other

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,609
ones you could push a button on an app

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,139
and just make a sound a giant kind of

00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,880
war-horn e sound coming up your phone

00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,310
just to kind of get us into the depth of

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,880
the game so something silly for me and

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,739
my mates and I wanted the buttons in

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,510
that as they look like they were

00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,100
something that you know you would find

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,040
in the cockpit of one of these giant

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,989
clanking robots also to look a bit like

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,310
an arcade controller because that's the

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,769
kind of stuff that I'm into and I like

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,049
so here's a really simple idea for a

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,670
component we've got a button with two

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,010
positions and up position in a down

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,810
position and we can see you know it's

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,819
just really two images so fitting that

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,229
into being something in react native not

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,919
too difficult and we can have a look at

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,329
some code here where hopefully you can

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,940
read the code it's not too small

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,370
we've just got you know a normal image

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,370
for our down version of our button which

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,260
we're we're

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,510
during their and it's you know in place

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,750
and sitting there and looking pretty and

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,750
on top of that

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,610
hopefully we're gonna position our up

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,010
version of that image now the up version

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,740
is absolutely positioned here over the

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,760
top of the down one but its opacity is

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,169
set to zero so that by default it's

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,850
going to be invisible and then we

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:54,669
wrapping that all in a touchable without

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,889
feedback which when we press it is going

00:04:54,669 --> 00:05:01,360
to change that up HD so that the UP

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:03,310
button sorry all the way around the down

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,729
button becomes visible I got my opacity

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,919
the wrong way around so we're hiding one

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:11,590
image that's placed over the other just

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,690
to kind of trick what we're what we're

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,520
seeing into feeling like something's

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,570
going up and down up and down and you

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,940
can kind of see what that looks like

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,430
here on it it's actually really quite

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,530
nice feeling when you kind of hitting

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,110
that on a phone and feeling that kind of

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,580
arcade button push you can even add in a

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,930
little bit of Hasek feedback there to

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,340
really make it feel like you're you've

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,560
got this little button clacking up and

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,889
down that's a really simple example of

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,270
something you can do but I wanted to go

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,070
a bit further and do something a bit

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,680
more fun I wanted to have this idea of

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,510
big levers if you imagine someone inside

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,669
again one of these cockpits of a big

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,289
robot pulling this lever down but I

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,870
wanted to make it you know simple easy

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:52,270
to use so just something which when you

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,520
tap and hold the lever goes down and

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,320
when you release it kind of snaps back

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,789
up and the idea of its snapping back up

00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,740
was quite important to me as well I want

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:03,010
it to feel like when you taps and held

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,240
that lever it felt like it was straining

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,389
to come down like there's some weights

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,070
behind it so in order to kind of build

00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,810
this up and I wanted to do it with you

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,669
know the really basic components that we

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,110
find in react native I want to do it

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:18,880
with just you know views images and some

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,570
animation so I was using the animations

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,190
library straight out of react native

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,500
just quickly how many people here have

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,620
used animations in react native or the

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,240
animations like that comes out the box

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,099
okay it's a good number I've just

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,700
quickly run through the kind of the core

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:38,380
concepts or the core bits of that

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,210
everything revolves around animated

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,590
views and animatable components or

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,370
animated values and

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:49,060
made four components an animated value

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:51,160
is a special value so normally a number

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,950
or something like that that you can

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,720
attach to one of your styles in an

00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,970
animated component and as you change

00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,430
that value you don't have to go through

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,980
the full re-render cycling react to

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,630
change the style in the component so

00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,750
animatable components can take these

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:11,650
special animated values and change over

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,600
time and the way you control that time

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,490
is by using an animated timing which

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,160
when you call a start on it you can say

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,710
I want to do you know change this value

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,570
from 0 to 100 over a period of you know

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,180
2 seconds or something like that so you

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,540
change the position of something over

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,280
that time and the last aspect to mention

00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,960
here is interpolation the idea that you

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,970
can take an animator value and map it to

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,040
another value this is really important

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,200
because it lets you drive lots of

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,150
different things in the app from one

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,690
animated value being changed over that

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,510
period of time so let's break down this

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,250
lever and and look first at the ball

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,460
that's on the end of it I want to

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,140
imagine that there's a box around that

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,690
and when I press and hold

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,030
I want that leaver head to drop to the

00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,440
bottom of the box and then when I

00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,290
release it I want it to go back up to

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,580
the top simple enough so I need to have

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,920
some kind of value that's going to take

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,660
me from this position at the top to this

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,100
position at the bottom so I know what my

00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,490
start and end values are gonna have to

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,720
be there's another aspect of this and

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,400
again this is me thinking about

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,140
skeuomorphic aspects and saying I want

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,030
this to feel like you know you're

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,650
pulling this lever down inside this dark

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,210
cockpit of this robot and there's light

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,770
spotlights everywhere above you and as

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,540
the leaver head is going past one of

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,160
those lights you see the reflection in

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,100
the light changing where it is over this

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,750
this ball so what we're actually doing

00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:40,390
here is rotating the the ball by you

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,040
know 70 odd degrees to make it feel like

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,580
that light source is changing its

00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,290
position and of course as it comes back

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,850
up we need to rotate it back and this is

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,460
where some of the interpolation comes in

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:54,700
because I want to drive all of this from

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,370
one value so again let's have a look at

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,860
a piece of

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,110
I'm going to initialize this animated

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,350
value at the top here to begin with with

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:07,050
a value of zero and then I'm going to

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,910
declare an animation that over the

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,380
duration of a thousand milliseconds so

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,240
one second it's going to change that

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,040
value to being whatever my max height is

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,390
so that's the the distance that I want

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,970
to move the ball down and I'm also going

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,410
to set up another animation another

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,300
animator timing that is going to have

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,100
that flick back to zero but this time

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,570
over 500 milliseconds so again I want

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,920
that to feel snappy or on the way back

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,010
up so you've got that feeling of weight

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,740
and then the spring back up of the lever

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,020
and finally I want that rotation to

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,670
happen I do that by interpolating that

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,220
same ball position value that I'm

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:44,070
driving so whether it's going up or

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,470
going down in value I'm mapping that to

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,870
a number of degrees between 0 and 70 so

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,220
we get that rotation and we can see what

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,230
that looks like in this animation here

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,020
you can kind of feel that light source

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,400
it's tricking you into feeling like it's

00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,720
you know you're moving past the light

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,710
source when all we're doing is applying

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,570
a little rotation to it so great we've

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,570
we've got an animated value going we've

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:10,830
got the head of the lever going let's

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:12,750
talk about the leaver shaft and in this

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,980
case I've got started with the animation

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,110
to give you an idea of what's going on

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,120
here we're kind of really shrinking it

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,540
and then making it grow back down at the

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,370
bottom so really we've got two images

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,610
here that we're using and you'll notice

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:29,850
that again the bottom one is rotated

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,290
around so that the shiny part is on the

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,320
other side so again so that you get that

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,760
feeling of it as it goes past the the

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,310
kind of the way you're looking down

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,760
straight on it that feeling that it's

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:46,170
gone past a light source there is a bit

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,510
of an overlap there where the you know

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,340
you've got one image that's shrinking

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,310
almost to zero and the other image that

00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,110
is growing and that's kind of a bit ugly

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,900
but fortunately for us the lever head is

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,820
going to be above that point so as we go

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,380
through that shrinking process but lever

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,770
is going to be hiding any nastiness

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,990
there which means that we can get away

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,480
with with being quite simple about this

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,580
and the idea again here is the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,090
you know just the basic API is that that

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,560
react gives the react Mason gives us so

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,420
again a little bit of code here and you

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,100
notice that this is really just doing

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,930
some interpolation off of that original

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,500
ball position we're just saying when the

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,780
ball position gets to halfway down so

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,900
when it's over the top of that small

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,940
section we're going to interpolate the

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:35,390
top part the leave of the leaver being

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,790
up to being down towards zero and then

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,960
we're going to do the opposite for the

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,110
one at the bottom it's going to

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,290
interpolate so that when it's from that

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,930
midpoint as the interpolation takes our

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,920
leave a hike to being or the ball

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,960
position to being at the very bottom

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,190
this one's going to grow and it will do

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,180
the inverse again because the

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:58,850
interpolation gives us that for free and

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,740
I'm going to also show you here we can

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,470
start to build up the actual animated

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:07,430
images into the into our tree now

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,840
starting with the lever up then the

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,200
lever down and then the leave a head at

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,120
the bottom and you can see where I'm

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,800
actually using those interpolated values

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,780
or in the case of the ball position the

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,150
actual animated value at the bottom

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,890
there it's worth noting that the lever

00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,070
head has to be the last thing that we're

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:27,740
putting in the the Dom here because we

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,010
want it to be rendered on top of all of

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,950
the other components so hopefully

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,660
nothing too kind of crazy going on there

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,960
it's again it's all just using very

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,030
basic react native API just the last

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,590
quick thing on this so we've got the the

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,680
base at the bottom of the lever and we

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,980
need to rotate this by 180 degrees at

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,270
the point at which the ball head is

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,130
going to be over it so again this

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,050
rotation gets hidden by the ball head

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,780
being over the top of it but it's a

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,280
slightly more interesting interpolation

00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,960
because we want it to be very sudden we

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,580
don't want it to be a smooth translation

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,980
so in this case my interpolation here

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,260
I'm saying I want you to go from zero

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,050
degrees to zero degrees for the first

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,080
half of the animation and then suddenly

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,130
flipped 180 degrees and stay 180 degrees

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,320
until the end of the animation

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,840
and again vice versa as the animated

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,700
value comes back up again so we get that

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,700
sudden flip at the halfway point

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,150
and then our animated image that would

00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:30,680
again just go into the Dom it would have

00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:32,630
to go above the the lever head because

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,870
the leaf head again needs to go over

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,370
this and that's what it looks and kind

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,770
of feels like when it's actually working

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,020
so you can get the feeling of this lever

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,990
that as you hold and tap down on it it

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,250
pulls down and as it flips back up again

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,620
it looks like it's moving past that

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,300
light source so just something a bit fun

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,410
a bit cool probably not something you're

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,170
going to see in very many business

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,090
applications least I kind of hope not

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,900
this be pretty awkward to use in

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:02,150
anything really serious cool so who

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,410
remembers why I started doing this

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:08,750
component in the first place anyone

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,420
going to make sounds it's supposed to be

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,410
a soundboard app why did I get so

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,930
sidetracked with making these silly

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,110
components so let's talk a little bit

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:21,080
about audio quickly so I did descent

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,610
using Expo because I really like Expo I

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,340
really rate it as a framework for

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,560
building react native apps if I can use

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,040
it if I don't need to reach for api's

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,750
outside of it I do and it gets me

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,830
started really quickly and I and I love

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,380
it for all these reasons

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:39,470
however I did find when developing the

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,150
audio for this that it doesn't really

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,830
provide me as finer grained control as I

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,990
really need for doing this and there are

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,940
some issues on Android so bumpy up

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,270
against some of those those edge cases

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:53,090
but I'll quickly take you through take

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,260
you through and playing audio and this

00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,660
applies in quite a lot of frameworks

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,490
actually so when I did audio in kind of

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,160
Java swing ten years ago there are a lot

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,380
of similar concepts and unfortunately a

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,270
lot of the API is documentation doesn't

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,860
tell you what order you need to do stuff

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,750
in even though the documentation is

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,400
really good so I kind of had to stumble

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,540
around in the dark a bit while working

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,760
this stuff out so the first thing you

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,830
need to do before you even get to take

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,780
that sound file and get it to come out

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,560
the speaker is to set the audio settings

00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,430
for your app and these can be quite

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,840
exclusionary of each other so you need

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,280
to read the documentation for that quite

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,660
carefully select the settings that you

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,880
want make sure you know you don't care

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,190
about recording do you care about you

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,630
know the app being able to play when the

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,010
app goes into the background and things

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,590
like that things that you can imagine a

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,630
regular audio playing

00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,070
might want to do whereas this is a city

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,480
soundboard and I don't really want to

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,200
interrupting you know people's phone

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,990
calls and then we need to preload the

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,550
sound because when you tap on a button

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,710
and you want the sound to play you don't

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,480
want to wait a few seconds while that

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,640
sound gets loaded into memory and then

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,530
plays you want it to be feel snappy and

00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,660
when I hit that little arcade-style

00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:02,860
button it just plays the sound and

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,180
finally we can play the sound but

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,830
there's this other concept you need to

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,720
think about and that's rewinding because

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,790
generally in a lot of these api's you

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,400
play a sound you have position in the

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,680
sound file where you are playing to and

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,660
unless you tell that explicitly to go

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,950
back to the beginning when you play the

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,940
sound again it will try and play from

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,980
the end and you won't get any sound

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,120
which is really annoying to debug and

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,980
work out while your sounds are playing

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,810
after one one hit so let's break this

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,130
down a little bit and look at setting up

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,700
the audio settings again we're talking

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,140
about Expo AV so I import that and then

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,520
I just pick the settings that are

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,630
correct me I'm not going to go through

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:43,300
these but it is things like here saying

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:44,440
you know play in silent mode in iOS so

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,120
you know if someone's got their phone

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,380
muted it's a soundboard app they

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,060
probably actually want to play the sound

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,010
and allow it to play and things like

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,410
that and the only fun setting there is

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,120
the oh no there's supposed to be a

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,420
little emoji of a duck there it doesn't

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,340
come up you'll have to trust me should

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,140
and should duck Android entertainingly

00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:07,330
named that is should the sound lower if

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,400
another app plays over the top so if

00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,740
your alarm that says your pizza's done

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,600
goes off do you want that to be louder

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,130
than your app well probably this is

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,770
again a silly soundboard app I don't

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,080
want it playing over other things so

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,580
then we can talk about the other three

00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,740
things and I want to deal with them all

00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,750
together because I really think that we

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,480
want to as developers think about them

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,870
as as one unit of work one one thing

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,460
that we want to happen so I've wrapped

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:39,190
this up in a kind of a convenient

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:41,080
function chord well create sound and

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,480
this is something that I would expect to

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,830
run you know during the splash screen of

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,050
the app or something like that we want

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,390
to be able to load up the sounds and get

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,610
them ready for playing while the user

00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,990
is you know distracted by some funky

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,610
splash screen or something like that

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,929
so I'm going to wrap everything in this

00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,880
convenient function which is going to

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:02,200
take the audio file or asset and because

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,780
it could come you know from the web or

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,030
something like that yes and it's going

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,440
to load it up and we're going to wait

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,059
for that to happen while it's happening

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,830
and you can actually pass in some extra

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,690
options here as well so in this case

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,280
this was me trying to use the Android

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,710
media player to see if I could get some

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,220
some bugs that I had with playing on

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,750
Android work now and then finally I'm

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,179
going to return a little object here

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,100
with a play function that is going to

00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:29,590
both do my playing of the sound and

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,630
reset it to zero so before I ever play

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,000
the sound in this case I'm going to be

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,820
resetting it to position zero and then

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,530
playing through you don't necessarily

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,929
always want to do this you might want it

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:44,080
to be that for example if I try and hit

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:45,370
a button twice it continues playing you

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,390
know the sound all the way through just

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:50,890
once and it'll only allow you to rewind

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,330
you know once it's played through and

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,830
finished but in this case I went for a

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,480
simplistic approach of if I mash a

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,380
button five times it's gonna start it

00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,870
five times

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,970
you know stopping each of the prior ones

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,610
and moving back to the beginning I did

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,190
mention that there are problems with

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,450
Android with x-bow IV that the problem I

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,700
came up against was it was actually

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,530
using the wrong volume control for a lot

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,600
of Android devices in fact when I gave

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:18,490
this to my friends who used Android

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:22,020
devices there they're up and down volume

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:25,600
buttons we're changing the system volume

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,400
while obviously the media volume was for

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,530
the app was what they controlled the

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,450
audio of the file in the app so they

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,640
couldn't physically change the volume of

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,140
that without having to go into their you

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,929
know system settings to change the

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,340
volume for their media settings and that

00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,110
was kind of a really rubbish experience

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,970
trying to tell each user no you have to

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,210
go into your system and do that an

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:48,070
ex-pro IV doesn't expose the various

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,720
volume controls to me so it was just a

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,790
bit frustrating and if I want to take

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,900
this app forwards and really do anything

00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,120
with it I'm probably going to have to

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,530
eject which is always a sad moment for

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,620
me with x-bow but sometimes it's

00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,620
necessary

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,480
I think I've got time to do one more

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:05,860
segment on this and I'm gonna talk a bit

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,710
about augmented reality so we're going

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:11,350
to leave one silly app about toy

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,389
soldiers behind and move on to another

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,470
hopefully so what what is augmented

00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:20,019
reality augmented reality is is putting

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,990
information and overlaying it over the

00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:25,299
you know the real world in digital

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,919
information and trying to look at it you

00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,649
know use it to augment your view of the

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,450
world or you know the way you hear the

00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:33,159
world in some cases so some examples

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,840
here you know your classic thing like

00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,220
the IKEA app which lets you place

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,870
furniture around your room by looking

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,700
through your phone but it goes on far

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,559
more than that and the best example that

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,019
I like to give is at the British Library

00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:46,299
there's a statue of isambard kingdom

00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:47,919
brunel within the ground for an outside

00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:49,840
with the QR code on it it's kind that QR

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,010
code and isambard kingdom brunel starts

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,570
talking to you through the speaker in

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,970
your phone you stood there in front of

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,760
this statue of this guy who's been dead

00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,470
for years and years and years I'm

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,710
listening to him talk obviously a voice

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,419
actor but you you get you know you're

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,250
going into depth in that experience it's

00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:08,980
another good example of augmented

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,480
reality but we're talking about Rhett

00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,929
native we're talking about mobile phones

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,419
in this case so we are going to talk

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,039
about doing some augmented reality with

00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:20,710
with using the camera on up on our

00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,840
phones so I made an app which was to

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,389
again help me playing board game in this

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,100
board game happens to use this love me

00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:31,120
hex grid and I thought it'd be really

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,710
cool if I could allow you know a user to

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,899
interact with this on a digital level

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,909
maybe to you know select which hexes

00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:38,919
that they were interested in or plan out

00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:41,019
their moves beforehand using their using

00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,580
their phone and think about some

00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,010
different mechanics in the game and even

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,039
you know potentially develop whole new

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,539
games that really kind of partially

00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,159
digital partially board game you know

00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:54,610
love the ideas that will probably never

00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:55,870
go anywhere but I thought okay so first

00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:00,279
things first I need to be able to draw

00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:03,700
some hexes over this real life board

00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:05,200
that I've got in front of me before you

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,460
even get there though you need to do the

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,289
the hello world of augmented reality

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,169
which is you know putting some text in

00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,070
the air and finally I promised you

00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,800
Solomon

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,900
and here is Solomon sleeping in a

00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,160
cardboard box obviously rather than the

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:24,580
expensive cat bed that we bought for him

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,980
and realistically there what I'm doing

00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,990
is just putting some text you know a

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,160
half metre up in front of me but let's

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,540
have a look at what that looks like in

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,280
code so I used a library called viro to

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,800
do this because I didn't want to have to

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,040
use the various libraries for iOS and

00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,340
Android specifically and actually viro I

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,230
think they recently went from a model

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,390
where you have to get a license and an

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,030
API key to being a bit more open source

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,140
and free which is kind of cool so

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,270
definitely recommend checking it

00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:01,390
checking it out if you're interested and

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:03,220
once the library has initialized we kind

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,020
of have this idea of tracking being

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,670
updated to say and you saw in that video

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,500
there was kind of the text was a bit

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,110
flickering around and then it's settled

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,700
so with a lot of augmented reality

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,650
applications you'll find that they are

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,120
literally tracking their surroundings

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,590
looking for flat surfaces looking to

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,790
ground themselves and we can start

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,290
detecting planes and things like that

00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:27,010
and so I'm just setting the state and

00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:28,780
changing this text to say meow once I've

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,180
done that and I'm positioning that text

00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,830
again just like a meter up in front of

00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,950
me so I had to be still in the right

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:38,020
place for it to say meow over the cat

00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:43,140
that code is not valid there's no

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:46,030
closing tag for that viro text I'm sorry

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,950
but the principle is there so we can put

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,920
some text in the air so let's take that

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:53,200
a step further and go okay let's detect

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,550
these images let's find these hexagons

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,350
and start drawing on top of them and

00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,660
you'd think that actually detecting a

00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,920
simple image would be the way to go to

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,480
be able to you know because that's how

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,860
we work as humans we see a simple

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,470
pattern and we can spot it around the

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,450
place but actually for computers a much

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,830
more complicated image is much easier

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,870
for it to find because it's a unique

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,960
thing in the field of vision of the

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,720
camera for it to find so in this example

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,350
here I want to find this mad little hat

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,210
from a coaster on my on my coffee table

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:26,730
rather than looking for the individual

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:31,960
hexagons shapes in that board

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:35,350
so this was kind of my first attempt of

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,840
taking that board and looking in it and

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,340
going okay draw a hex just in this

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,320
position because once I know where the

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,150
board is I know where the hexes are in

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,919
it so I'm kind of laying over

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:49,630
information I know into this and then

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,549
once you can do that you can do sorts of

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:55,000
fun things like going okay well we can

00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:56,860
start animating these hexagons we can

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,410
start having entry animations when we

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,390
detect the the borders in our vision and

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,679
then you can start to get interactions

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,330
where someone's tapping on one of those

00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:05,320
and starting to have some fun with them

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,000
it's going to play that one again

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,620
because the most interesting part of it

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,390
is at the very beginning of the

00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,160
animation as everything kind of flips in

00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,070
and you can see how quickly that happens

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,650
it's as soon as it detects that image in

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,330
focus so let's have a look at some code

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,640
for this

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm literally saying to the library hey

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,370
here's an image and this is how wide it

00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,910
is and I want you to keep an eye out and

00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:33,460
look for that image so I'm saying here

00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,870
the image is 40 centimeters wide I know

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,110
actually four centimeters wide because

00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,870
this code is for the little hat that was

00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:44,320
on a coaster and so four centimeters

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:46,530
wide and that gives it an idea of when

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:52,000
it detects that image also how far away

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:55,210
that object is or that plane is and then

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,490
I'm registering that in the code here to

00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,600
say when the target of hat which is the

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,059
image that I've registered with you

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,900
earlier comes up in this case I'm saying

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:07,240
draw a box of that size at that point

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,650
five centimeters or 50 centimeters five

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,980
centimeters in this case above that

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,120
image and I'm applying exactly the same

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,980
logic when I'm drawing all those

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,820
hexagons and having them animating and

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,700
things like that there's a whole

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,070
animations library that's built into

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:24,730
vyro reacts works in a very similar way

00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:26,590
to how I'm registering the image there

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,490
you register animations that you can

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,660
then call on on the various objects and

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,970
you start to realize that something that

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:38,010
you you think of as being quite tough to

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:39,930
do in a language like JavaScript or in

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,360
like react native you think augmented

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,550
reality that must need some intense 3d

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,810
processing things like that actually no

00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,550
that's that's all being done by

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,120
libraries that we're being exposed to

00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:52,290
and a declarative format like the react

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,930
syntax like JSX

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,580
is really good for saying hey when you

00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,830
see this image draw something on top of

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,100
it and so it's a really convenient kind

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,090
of paradigm to work in if you are

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,460
interested in talking about this some

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:08,310
more you can check me out on github I

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,320
don't really do Twitter sorry but yeah

00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,460
try and look at react native from a

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,780
different perspective if you get the

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,150
chance I really encourage you to have

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,740
some fun look out there at what you can

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,260
do that's a bit more off the beaten path

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,360
and and and then come up here and tell

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,880
me all about the fun you've had just a

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,890
quick plug because I work for a company

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,650
with Ana planners at the beginning we

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,510
are hiring we're always hiring this is

00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,980
just a quick selection of jobs you can

00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,780
find the full list of jobs that we've

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,670
got open at the moment at board's

00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,560
greenhouse to a forward slash and a plan

00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,660
and we are looking for react native

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,760
developers at the moment so please

00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:45,000
please get in touch if you're interested

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,980
so the question was did I look at using

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,470
the native driver when doing animations

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,240
and yeah for some of the animations

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,420
though I could have used explicitly set

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,060
it up to use the native driver it's

00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,430
effectively adding a extra argument when

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,930
setting up the animated timing for

00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,570
example it only works on certain

00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,830
properties it's worth noting and it

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,790
works a lot better if you're using the

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:10,260
translations

00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:12,120
part of the animations API I didn't need

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:16,530
to include it in the code samples was

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,450
the short answer and so the yeah the

00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,190
question was can can you actually

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,810
animate the height and the width of a

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,950
native component and actually yes you

00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:28,770
you can adjust the certain properties

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:31,020
certain style props that are not part of

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:35,280
the translation and height is one of the

00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:37,860
work those also the position so your top

00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,240
your left or your right your bottom but

00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,990
it isn't as effective as using the

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,940
translations so so the question is

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,370
around the algorithm that's being used

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,460
to match the images in the augmented

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,730
reality work and I'll be honest I don't

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,480
know and

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:58,480
we'll likely be whatever they are kits

00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,260
and a Ark or are using for their native

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,380
image matching so because realistically

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,990
Viro AR is is really just a library

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,520
that's interfacing with the the native

00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,310
libraries that are being used and they

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,580
do provide their own ways of doing that

00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,180
I think you can pick the algorithm you

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,910
want

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,220
when using AR kit but I've not used it

00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,200
directly myself my Objective C and Swift

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:27,350
is terrible and well if there isn't

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:31,070
anything else I'll hand you back over

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,070
