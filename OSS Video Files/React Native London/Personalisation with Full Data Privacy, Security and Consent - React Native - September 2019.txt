we have this me he really and we are

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,220
here in London with you I'm fab

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:13,860
James and Jacob so let's go very quickly

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,480
through the content where we see that

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,369
the biggest investment are in this

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,800
moment without the area in which the big

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,150
companies are investing we are working

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,310
with a lot of company in the other of

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,619
FinTech a lot around

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,619
I am personalization in terms of

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,619
consumer engagement obviously artificial

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,270
intelligence and distributed technology

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,420
we see a lot of work in the area of

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,300
personalized health and in particular we

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,610
see a lot of momentum in sharing our

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,590
personal data my trade my specific

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,870
chronic disease of specific pathology in

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,809
the other personal health we see

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,230
consumer IOT developing a lot and smart

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,690
cities

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,070
the problem is Man City is a bigger one

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,559
is around business modeling and we

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,600
sustain initial cost but all of these

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,879
all of this technology all of this

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,640
driver has something in common they have

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,310
personal data availability of rich

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,810
consumer data with privacy security and

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,450
consent today we saw that and we live

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,590
every day that the big American

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,240
companies people like us developer that

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,439
developed something but they didn't

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,680
touch in mind but at the end what the

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,780
really development was absolutely clever

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,000
potentially can be used not exactly how

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,470
they intended to use it and we have

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,020
several example and we have several

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,869
companies that we are working with that

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,759
developed this kind of critical and

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,729
disruptive use cases but then they have

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,350
a problem how do I use the person of

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,549
that of the individual of the

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,329
individuals in an ethical and in a fair

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,210
way that the individual is away so

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,549
before I go ahead I want to point out

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,299
something that we were lucky to be part

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,149
of the UK that is a study that the UK

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,840
government supported around data

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,620
portability this study say that GDP are

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,409
as clearly

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,920
problem and how do we drive data

00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:19,510
portability gdpr is an answer is a

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,730
potential answer but is not yet the

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,920
solution you develop data portability

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,709
but after that we have a series of

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,989
constraint that but that are not

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,989
completely bridging with the end user

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:34,480
and we have in each industry several

00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:36,190
area that are trying to develop API to

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,930
give back that ought to give that a

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,480
portability to the individual but it

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,660
don't tell you the tools to provide that

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,160
a portability to the end and the

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,200
conclusion of this report

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,599
I repeat from the government from the UK

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,239
government was the concept of data

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,519
mobility so that mobility is the answer

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,069
is the answer to this data portability I

00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,720
will show you relator the framework I do

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,159
apologize you want to see line of code

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,590
you want to see use cases but it's

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,269
really important that I frame what you

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:09,519
will see later with something more

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:11,290
high-level I am this reporter that was

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,510
delivered by this small management

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,450
consultancy company only of the UK

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,450
government in particularly it was not

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,900
ICO DCMS the agency the Department for

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,060
Culture Media and Sport that is

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,010
overseeing all the path communication

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,810
medium sport that is overseeing all the

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,340
guidelines to the other agencies in

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,450
terms of what to do with personal data

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,030
and this study identified some coalition

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,449
and then suddenly the UK government said

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:44,849
to this agency we deliver report with

00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:48,040
liver problem we are always late with

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:50,919
ruling in regulating the industry why

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,829
this developer startup or these big fans

00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:56,349
are going superfast in developing how we

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:58,180
can validate our statements around that

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:01,120
the mobility with something much more

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,560
tangible and we were lucky enough to be

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,449
involved in something that was a

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,010
consequence of that an ability we were

00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:09,519
involved in something that is called a

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,099
mobility infrastructure sandbox so they

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,349
say okay they look at the market and

00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,570
they say what are the platform and the

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,479
player that has this vision of changing

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,650
they what I call the arena sense of data

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,960
portability who has the vision

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,580
provide a service a platform that is a

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,160
real in mind with data mobility and we

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:32,150
were lucky enough to be involved with

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,979
these minor plans into the study so

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,600
these small brains I was really ashamed

00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:40,280
when I was there producing the record

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,680
with them work with us and look at the

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,840
architecture and we see we identified

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,669
several gaps but now let's go back

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,699
because this is really relevant for the

00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:52,820
alternative why is relevant I will tell

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,680
you in a few seconds the modern with

00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:02,780
data portability is that you have a data

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:04,430
export that important then suddenly you

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,560
are the individual giving the consent

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,960
GDP are they still in that and then open

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,320
banking again with open API he is asking

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,949
the consent not in a standardized way

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,280
then we got an ability the UK government

00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:21,889
and also now in California the same in

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,440
Singapore interest enough this there is

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,630
something said in a comment is identify

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,280
a new role in society that this role is

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,169
the data facilitator it not a

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,050
facilitator is acting on behalf of the

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:36,349
living to provide the tools to allow a

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,250
user to give the consent for the data to

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:42,020
be move from one point to another point

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,780
there are data facilitator of different

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,340
level of security we have been

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,260
positioning the highest level of

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,830
security and I will tell you why because

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,990
we don't see all the other more other

00:05:51,830 --> 00:06:02,389
models of other for that a facilitator

00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:04,909
of everything in the same location now I

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,470
don't go in the detail of this report

00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:08,659
I'm available to share it you will find

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,060
it online if you google this report you

00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:13,460
will find it is on the website of these

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,380
guys and also supported by ICO so I'm

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,970
not speaking or something that is not at

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,820
the government level but is something

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,010
that was overseen by ICAO by several

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,580
university but consumer international

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,780
the consumer itself work on this now

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,780
let's go to be

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,660
the facility is taking all your personal

00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,580
data and your digital life because when

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,770
you walk I like the image of our

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,600
Chairman and there is a video of our

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,280
Chairman that is while walking in his

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,500
life is living a lot it's digital

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,630
footprint is living a lot of digital

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,730
data without his knowing okay but this

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:57,100
data belongs also to us so we our life

00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:02,440
but this data belonging to us how we are

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:05,080
able to normalize it start it and use it

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,350
for our benefit and that is the role of

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:12,070
the facilitator we should have the tools

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,410
to capitalize the data read it and then

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,580
decide who we are sharing the data with

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:21,070
and for what purpose

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:24,100
okay what is our why we do this one so

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:26,680
we have a different role in this entire

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,110
ecosystem of personal data sharing the

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,240
first one is a single source so several

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,220
developers are working with us simply

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,960
because there is a single API and then

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,960
with a single via you can extract data

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,240
from your medical record indeed I don't

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,260
remember the wattage data but in the UK

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,470
we enable image if you go to your local

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,810
GP practice you will ask I want to have

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,970
my patient access credential and we are

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,540
one of the few partners that will show

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,880
your medical data I know your needs is

00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,980
here with us that is following me she is

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,080
following the process she is that this

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,910
missing this is missing however was

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,280
already a major milestone for us to be

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,680
we were fast track in six months we were

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,720
able to get it compared with we under

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,100
that event frankly I was really happy

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,480
for the success of all these people

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,980
ended even in that I'm speaking I'm the

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,620
fluffy guys these guys are really

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:21,540
delivering the good stuff that is

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:25,420
brought his product because medical data

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,950
finance that wearable data what you

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,750
listen what you see what you store and

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,150
you decide use as an individual you

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,240
decide where you put this data so I take

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:40,629
all of this one it is in a

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,789
is in a single ontology so ontology that

00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:45,059
is growing also if you're headed to D

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,220
sometimes you can grow and this ontology

00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,259
and this data with a common ontology is

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,269
sitting in the personal cloud of the

00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:54,220
individual so the individual say ok I

00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:58,660
take all this data add all these sources

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,809
and suddenly I put it in my G G Drive or

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,480
I put it in Azure sorry in onedrive or I

00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:07,329
put it in Dropbox so everything is owned

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,339
and stalled at the individual and is

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:13,149
obviously and that is why we are working

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:14,980
with companies fine consent so that is

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,959
why I call it is there a nice and soft

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,920
personal data sharing it's not something

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,319
Arvest in the other

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,939
no one is are wasting anything we do

00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:24,279
machine learning and we do artificial

00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:27,819
intelligence with a consent and we are

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,009
just a consent platform private sharing

00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:31,959
h processed processing because then we

00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:35,649
provide and they will tell you a little

00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:38,529
bit more around my field speak on what

00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:41,619
we really do but we provide SDKs Android

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,619
SDKs R Us SDK then we'll probably we

00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:48,369
need a little bit of your competences

00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:51,069
around react native and several of our

00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:53,799
customer partners integrator we have

00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:55,660
here tonight one company that is doing

00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,339
user research with us they need to

00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,589
develop an application for other and

00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:02,379
react native is potentially the answer

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:06,309
for them so and it's better for business

00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:08,619
and is rich data so now let's finish the

00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:10,689
pidgin English to show something a

00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:12,129
little bit more in a video you see some

00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:14,559
screen and then I will go through some

00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:16,360
use cases and then I will give you a

00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,279
couple of details in terms of high level

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,560
platform and we go in the other day so

00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:31,229
let's

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:31,229
[Music]

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,300
[Music]

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,420
what you see here is the application but

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,389
the application is not a Cordova the

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,160
application is the content that is

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:49,860
evolved in every released people are

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,230
contacting us our path one of our

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,050
partner in the u.s. was screaming I

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,899
found in August which I completely

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,519
changed the interface I release it and

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,860
they produce all the marketing material

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,629
twelve back to the boarding subside

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:08,250
without I promise I will not do it

00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:10,529
anymore but we obtained is not oh you

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,680
see the client I love the client but it

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,070
noticed work is the real capability is

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,600
the platform

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,580
[Music]

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,100
these are example of application that

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,510
are developed on top of the bottom in

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,980
which you can develop a lot of

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:30,490
additional application

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:34,010
[Music]

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:39,970
okay I this is a funny example that we

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:42,620
use is a SD FP and what we did is put

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,470
all your social data in this application

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,310
your social data is analyzed and and

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:52,400
then we I think it's better that I show

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,170
you the video and then I saw a couple of

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,730
user that call me and this is an example

00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:08,060
of app that can be developed on top of

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:10,540
our of our platform I do apologize for

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,540
this worry

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:34,270
[Music]

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,440
so a group of doctors GP share this

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,390
application between them and you need to

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,730
know the doctors typically they go from

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:49,029
the University directly into serious job

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,160
and two of these guys contact me say

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:54,160
thank you thank you and thank you again

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,410
and they share with me the screen of all

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,769
the how many times in their post they

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,480
use very vulgar words before and after

00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:04,000
and I have to say this application was

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,670
really useful for them there was a niche

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,260
market we are improving this application

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,510
because we think for certain niche

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,140
market in terms of analyzing the social

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,360
what you put the results our journal is

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,940
contacting us in the part of the me to

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,100
movement and she was not aware that five

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,170
years earlier a friend of our social

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,970
control made some comment that was not

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,980
exactly in line with what she was

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,660
writing so again that comment was

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,630
captured and it was deleted from the

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,820
social media it is relevant but think

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,410
this is just an example of use case or

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:41,440
something that you can apply in terms of

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:45,040
analyzing the data another another

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,820
application that we develop we are work

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,920
we work at the beginning of our of setup

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,140
of our capability we decided to expand

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,270
per market and the first market where it

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,399
was easy to expand was Iceland very

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,649
small market so we did the integration

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,270
with the healthcare system and this is

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:03,040
another example of application in which

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:06,130
the personal data is used by an

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,959
individual - before travelling but the

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,760
data is extracted directly from the

00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,760
local healthcare system

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:25,240
keep this music hydro project but I

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,240
really hated

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,740
[Music]

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,820
[Music]

00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:01,030
our product our product challenges so

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,640
far you saw two example but our product

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,710
platform challenges are more at how I do

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,300
enable the user experience of this

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,700
application better to give you an

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,460
example we were both in a meeting room

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,130
yesterday to speak how I create deep

00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,500
linking into the content platform how I

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,630
pass the data for analysis as soon as I

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,780
receive the data there is a big activity

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,700
to work on our side we have thousands of

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,920
requirement and spec in this moment in

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,410
order to improve the platform so what

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,910
you see our example but then a community

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,620
of developer that has the tool to

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,230
develop a model application can go and

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,260
the end deliver the next use case to our

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,510
partners now what are the benefits for

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,730
our developer and partner and why they

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:47,380
are working with us as I already touch

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:50,770
it a single normalized API involving a

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,920
lot of sources we already proved that

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:57,150
all the resources that you can allocate

00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,570
the lever with we work with a couple of

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:02,530
customer to develop PLC's and

00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,720
practically all the resources that you

00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,400
are located to add sources or to do the

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,860
normalization of the data to get the

00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,600
data can be allocated to develop the

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,210
application or develop the use cases

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,420
that was already a winning argument for

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,980
our partner certainty of your investment

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,660
because if all this part of

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,730
normalization of the data is already

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,530
there you don't have it you don't invest

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:27,280
okay probably is not an argument for

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:29,380
several of you here but potentially your

00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,320
employer potentially the one that will

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,870
give you the next job are happier to

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,420
have hapax operational cost than capex

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,190
uncertain capex and that is one of the

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,860
argument that we have very often with

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,660
these companies and then the data

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,300
compliance that is a big part but I

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,610
already show you the stamp of in the UK

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,890
that we had here it's all about trust

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,140
Eve all about be sure that the

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,420
individuals when they do a constant

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,600
access they come and they are sure that

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,910
the data is there for this where we are

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,280
investing a lot is and we are working a

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,170
design level with several agencies not

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,280
only in the UK but in other part of the

00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,230
world too

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,090
be sure that privacy by design is

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,250
implemented when you do a contract you

00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:14,140
clarify exactly what is going on what is

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,880
processing the device what this process

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,580
outside advice who you are sharing the

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,660
data with and all the classical

00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,860
challenge that you have in private data

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:26,250
sharing I if you have any question on

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:29,220
the infrastructure I capacity

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,440
multi-layered security all-around

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,890
centric data protection push and pull

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,260
data services I didn't show you but we

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:41,080
for several projects we are more working

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:45,730
on the day push the data into other so

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,310
image that you have today download your

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,620
data that is a completely and secure

00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:52,660
mechanism giving the responsibility to

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,030
individual to be responsible for their

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,920
data in their PC is completely not a

00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,770
viable option for data portability

00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,630
however in order to have the stamp of

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,520
data portability several company are

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,870
doing that this is not an option is

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,730
exposing the data of the user

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,870
particularly if their data is a medical

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:13,420
data or is a relevant social data and

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,950
then we have the SDK our dream is to

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,810
become the private data sharing

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,210
infrastructure that is where we think

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,100
and to be regulated in to real-time why

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,860
because it's a healthier economy in

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,870
terms of personal data and now after

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,580
I've done the fluffy part we have the

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,740
part in which we tell a lot more about

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:33,190
what you are here for so why it is so

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,310
important for you so hi I'm James I am

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,160
head of product delivery delivering all

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:42,280
these thousands of Specter fat pros my

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,850
way and I'm Jacob I'm one of the mobile

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,650
team leads

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,120
did you mean so driving all this

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,770
development process forward is my

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,960
day-to-day it's my bread and butter so

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,320
to speak and did you mean we welcome

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,360
developers just like you guys I did you

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,460
spear developing myself started off in

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:03,570
ActionScript can you remember that yes

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,570
and I moved over to the dark side

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,230
Jacob still enjoying it yeah very much

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,370
done enjoying it what he says I hope he

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,330
you guys can't agree with me on that

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,559
fact yeah

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,320
and obviously

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:16,450
very passionate for development and what

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,490
you guys can bring to the table so I'm

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,620
going to show you a quick video this is

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,840
it's a little bit old number your eye

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:26,309
has changed but this is targeted at

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,309
developers such as yourselves

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,819
[Music]

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:55,079
[Music]

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,230
[Music]

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,369
[Music]

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:14,160
okay so your data is effectively

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:19,110
fragmented you've got it split across

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,110
different medical sources finance social

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,870
but effectively what we're doing is

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,300
putting that base together in one place

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:34,420
and place it you own and a place that

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:37,330
you control nuts as a user as a

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,490
developer we want to empower you guys to

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:47,140
access that data should a user want to

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:49,180
share it with you it says so we treat

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,680
data as a hierarchy within within did

00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,110
you me and the context that digitally

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,640
brings to developers so I think to best

00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,650
visualize this I'll give you guys a

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,020
couple of scenarios so if you're looking

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,430
to use a users personal data within your

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,320
app there might be a number of

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,780
approaches you take to accomplish this

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,500
so let's take for example a nicer

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,390
tomorrow you want to analyze a user's

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:14,200
listening habits across sobriety sources

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:16,480
perhaps Spotify apple music diese there

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,820
were various other ones as well and that

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,470
was a music for example you need to

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,810
aggregate the data from these various

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,140
sources and you need to analyze it and

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:28,510
gain useful insights out of that so then

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,190
derive your own kind of logic and and

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,460
give the user an output something back

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,290
perhaps a curated music playlist so

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,840
you've now got potentially upwards of

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,850
four services to connect to each with a

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,190
different kind of data set different

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,050
ontology different mappings and now

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,180
you've got two trumps there somehow make

00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:49,270
sense of all of that and pull it

00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,350
together into some kind of unified UI it

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,360
seems like a bit the nightmare if you

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,260
ask me and anyone anyone who's been

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,390
there and tried that may may well agree

00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:01,000
so we take to structure data in some

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,650
kind of hierarchy now the idea is that

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,650
every new source that comes in to

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,000
digitally fits into this somewhere so we

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,550
define an ontology

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,500
and that ontology acts as the baseline

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,690
for all new sources to be integrated

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,789
into which means when you think

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,610
data for example as we were saying music

00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:20,500
data it's in an easy-to-read simplified

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,019
and uniform format and no matter where

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,629
it comes from and that's the real thing

00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:27,759
that we're we're offering here that that

00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:29,320
as developers is definitely a benefit to

00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,110
you guys because we're streamlining the

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,759
skimming the the means of getting the

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,580
data from the provider into the

00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,250
third-party app these building blocks

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,720
all go into the central parts that

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,919
people out have touched on that earlier

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,539
we'll get to that in more detail shortly

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:48,279
and then this gets arranged by a number

00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:50,649
of kind of algorithms and mapping

00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,269
systems to our unified ontology which

00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:53,950
has since that's out there the rent in

00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:58,600
the form of unified data to developers

00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:00,250
and consumers you go into code names and

00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,000
set on code names such as P cloud on

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,940
your browser

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,309
it's just we so day-in day-out we have

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,470
some clouds so we mean Dropbox onedrive

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,299
Google Drive that's where your data

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:14,289
stored it's not stored in did you mean

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:16,750
we do not hold that data and we're

00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:19,659
processing across multiple sources so if

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:24,070
I mentioned UK NHS earlier might be the

00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:26,620
US medical system as well listen we're

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,350
basically mapping it's gone to a unified

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,879
ontology in the case of medical we are

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,879
mapping on fire which the universal

00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:35,679
standard which means a vaccination to

00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:37,600
you guys as a vaccination it's not a

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,279
different object type if you happen to

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,409
want to do a medical app from UK you

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,179
wanted to emedco at the u.s. you can

00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:46,509
make a medical app for the world which

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:48,519
is amazing yeah on the subject of

00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:51,460
unified data sets from across different

00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,740
sources we've now taken this example of

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,200
music and we've got an easy-to-use API

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,210
and SDK for those twitch TV SDK and

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,159
we've made it easy for you guys to get

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,440
that unified data set and gain some real

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,120
insights on that quickly but let's not

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,970
stop at music let's go and talk about

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,230
something

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,230
a little bit more tightly controlled

00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,730
like finance data so anyone who's tried

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,350
to integrate the finite state so whether

00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,540
that's through various third parties or

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,770
the new open banking standard will know

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,080
that there's a number of hurdles that

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,240
you may face its developer the notable

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,650
one is SSE a three month so that's the

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,020
financial conduct authority they

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,630
regulate all kind of uses of financial

00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:30,530
data in and out and and transforming and

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:33,430
displaying etc so that's the home itself

00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,930
technique to obtain clearance and then

00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,610
now initially we we somewhat take that

00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:41,840
away from you we we've done the heavy

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:45,370
lifting we yeah we've done heavy lifting

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,510
where we're we're in the process of

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,690
obtaining this clearance at the moment

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,600
and and as such when when the output

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,980
comes to you guys it's it's ready and

00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:11,870
the regulations that you guys want to

00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:13,880
follow is significantly less like this

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,860
medical if you guys wanted to go direct

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,390
to NHS to get the data it's gonna take

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,280
you an average of two years so access it

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,140
from us you can be up and running in a

00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,510
couple of hours which is amazing so

00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,510
that's about data let's move on ah

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:32,900
security now we're not security experts

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,430
what we employ the best in the world so

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,770
Jacobs come through his best that don't

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,480
prove this slide we certainly do so

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,700
naturally it digitally where we're

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,530
dealing with the users person data that

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,720
is things that are identifying them on a

00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,370
personal level and ultimately things

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,020
that they want to keep safe especially

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,730
from the likes of Facebook and various

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,990
other logical operators have been doing

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,660
rather unsavory things of them in recent

00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,730
times to do this we employ

00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,740
military-grade security so this is the

00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,360
same level of technique you'll find in

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,150
the mo D it's the same type of tech that

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,440
you'll find in government and to be

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,780
quality it's the best in the business

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,940
so from an authentication point of view

00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,880
and we for the use of

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,070
so trust anchors from top sunny

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,810
authorities and that really just allows

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,280
the digitally apps to the absolutely

00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,870
competent what they're talking to and

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,790
also allows third parties and

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,320
developments coming in to be competent

00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,540
that the the people they're getting this

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,270
this data problem are in fact reputable

00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,700
and and it hasn't been metal in some way

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,560
now the subjects of meddling as James

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,090
touched on or the data their user

00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,610
contributes to their to Jimmy's library

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,930
is stored outside them digitally we

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,170
don't we don't touch that we don't hold

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,160
it user defined so they want to put that

00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,750
we've touched on the term people I

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,160
thought about it since and so that's

00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,290
what we mean by that is some kind of

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,120
cloud storage solution so your Dropbox

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,070
and Google Drive you want dry nicely

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,350
decentralized and very much in the users

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,760
control domain rather than ours I think

00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,840
that's one of the main things that uses

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,120
a particular bike about the Disney

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,770
platform is the fact that we can't see

00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,900
what we do the data I mean the user

00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,150
hopes the key on the subjects of holding

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,270
the key when a library is created

00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,220
muscles created and we use a high-level

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,780
keep derivation functions to to generate

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,040
a king off of that which is then

00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,020
exchanged to another set of keys at the

00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,210
back end and effectively all the data

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,430
that goes into the library is signed and

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,750
compressed and encrypted and then

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,010
encrypted again when it goes into the

00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,910
big cloud because they handle their own

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:24,500
systems in that sense this means that

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,880
well even if we have the credentials

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,320
against that they planned it would mean

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,110
nothing to us it's just a bunch of

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,630
binary data the real beauty is the fact

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,720
that the user is at all times convinced

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:37,700
and very much in control of who can read

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:42,170
that's because what they only only then

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:44,810
hold the key thank you very much so

00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,890
we've talked about what data comes from

00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:50,060
we talked about data normalization

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:52,880
talked about security the user owns the

00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:56,960
data and then Talmud sheriff you guys

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,060
developers if they choose to which is

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,770
your space that teaching me this is

00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,580
where you can get in touch with us this

00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,580
is where you can get going

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,289
developing process and work somehow

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,509
sometimes we we cap ability to mobile

00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:23,710
application communities to work where we

00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:25,840
steal identities so the and in there you

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,090
can find for reference dogs for our

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,129
ontology explaining different object

00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:36,159
types and service IDs etc if you guys

00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:38,320
consume them so we're always working to

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,669
improve Docs and we pride ourselves on

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,529
working very closely with developers and

00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:43,360
naturally when integrating on the

00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,759
platform such as this we want it to be

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:56,129
as pain free as possible for you guys as

00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:56,129
such any feedback anyone has on this and

00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:31,570
sometimes there is always very available

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:33,999
very reachable later ok so getting

00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,220
started us sent Thunder buses and

00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,799
compromise which is amazing first thing

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,129
you need to do is go to developer

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,869
support

00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:44,019
register where you can get hold of an

00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:47,110
app ID and then you can start looking at

00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:49,119
playing building your own app you also

00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:53,169
need a private private sharing contract

00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:55,119
so the contract will explain how much

00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:59,889
data you want the user which services

00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:08,980
you might user which time period you

00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:12,309
might want it over that is any time to

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,049
clarify this one to play we allow access

00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:15,819
to

00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:17,769
but obviously there are certain up and

00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:21,369
certain category that we need to work

00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:23,919
together in the past our partner Oscar

00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:25,149
see everything but potentially we need

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,449
to work together because there are

00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:30,699
certain in which we also need to discuss

00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:32,799
together we'll be authorized and what is

00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:34,989
like this with it so we need to work

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,189
together obviously to allow to play with

00:31:34,989 --> 00:31:38,109
you we start together

00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:40,329
and we play but then there is a moment

00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:41,769
in which before you go live we need to

00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:44,829
have a discussion around the Diaz case

00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:47,769
if you use it like for instance maybe

00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:51,189
turn up anything so some good data I

00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:52,659
mentioned earlier us healthcare you may

00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:53,889
not have access to that but it doesn't

00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:55,509
mean you can't throw a nap because we

00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:57,219
provide some more data for all our

00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:58,599
sources and our sandbox environment

00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,199
which means you can go and play very

00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:01,119
very quickly

00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:04,989
we've got libraries of pre-populated

00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:07,349
with finance medical social you name it

00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,349
we've got it

00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:16,419
so what system to do with react native

00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:18,909
yes I say that the statement to manage

00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:22,239
expectation we need the demo cognitive

00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:24,639
all your contribution is welcome to see

00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:26,319
that your motivators is welcome but we

00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:31,389
wanted to show some of our partners that

00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:37,749
they can develop and then please have

00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:39,939
your hand dirty play yeah so you could

00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:42,309
disclose it have touched on we are

00:32:39,939 --> 00:32:43,479
pretty much a mobile-first business but

00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:45,219
react natives have believed you concept

00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:48,849
to us the the digital apps are developed

00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:50,469
natively in in certain common but this

00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:52,179
is a really exciting technology that

00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,739
started but to become more prevalent in

00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:56,829
the industry and you guys are very much

00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:58,539
an example of that we we want to invest

00:32:56,829 --> 00:33:00,279
in this quite heavily in terms of better

00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:03,339
supporting the developers they choose to

00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,479
build on with react native of which some

00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:07,449
of the examples we will share with you

00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:09,279
in just a moment now that mentioned the

00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:12,189
demo we do have a react native SDK

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,139
available it's very much in the demo

00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:16,749
supremely staged there's a lot of

00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:18,819
ironing out to do and really we want

00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:20,350
everybody's help with this we want did

00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:21,789
you meeting very much a community

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,500
particularly when it comes for open

00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:25,450
source sdk because that naturally

00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,000
follows the open source ethos and that's

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,980
something that we very much believe in

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,299
and as such please please give it a spin

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,700
and give us your feedback because we

00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:35,830
would absolutely love to hear how to

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,840
further minimize that's backflow of

00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:41,679
those pain points or you guys ask react

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,590
native developers going forward so as a

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,390
company we're going to invest a lot more

00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:48,450
in recognizing visual realizes people

00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:52,570
like you out there who wants to build

00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,740
code once multiple platforms so a

00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:00,490
streaker mentioned we do have the

00:33:53,740 --> 00:34:00,789
starter project which will show in a

00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,400
minute

00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:07,539
using great native we definitely want to

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:10,290
invest more on this trip as well so you

00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:12,669
guys want to yeah check a project down

00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:17,950
raise for requested cetera you're more

00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:20,010
than welcome we will welcome it so how

00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:22,030
does it work

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,649
this should be a pretty standard model

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:26,200
for you guys by now having integrated at

00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:29,440
various third parties we have a native

00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,669
ios and android sdk currently in Colin

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,450
and ajaita C respectively

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:36,100
now the react native SDK takes this and

00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,929
effectively built to the breach between

00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,909
the JavaScript special type script and

00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:41,020
the native code again this is advanced

00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:43,540
and you guys have been what we used to

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,700
we are potentially looking at branching

00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,679
out into a completely JavaScript /title

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,760
SDK and dropping the bridge and that's

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,409
something we'd love to hear everybody's

00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,090
thoughts on because again it's about

00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:55,330
making it and stress-free as possible

00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:58,900
for the developers that's us are you

00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:00,160
guys and the bridge effectively takes

00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,960
the requests that come from the react

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,460
native app and proxies and through this

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,060
bridge and then delivers them into the

00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,530
native SDKs and vice versa with response

00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,119
again pretty much standard you guys on

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:15,910
the sinister force I won't bore you with

00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:19,030
the details now we've got an example of

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:21,130
an app has been native pub sees you

00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:25,990
running away even though he was about to

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:29,740
talk about this he's a partner of ours

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:31,990
in the US they are

00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,270
next week might have a conference in

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,610
Helsinki we've been working with them in

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,980
the last six months what they do is very

00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:51,100
interesting because they connect all the

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:59,170
sources and they inside us using our

00:35:51,100 --> 00:36:01,630
platform and I'll show you a video now

00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,760
that we have in the next page but the

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:07,540
most important message it is because it

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:16,360
is using but let's let's show what they

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:18,400
do for you to take control of your data

00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,530
and earn income from the value it

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,119
generates starting in the seventy six

00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:24,520
billion dollar market research and

00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,380
insights industry companies want to

00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,990
study things like which types of coffee

00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,670
people who do yoga drink most often what

00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,980
clothing brands appeal to people who

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,780
listen to country music or how travel

00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,850
affects the kinds of restaurants people

00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,770
prefer they don't want to know about you

00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:41,260
personally just groups of people like

00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,720
you whether you are a mom a gamer a

00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,030
software developer or a runner or all of

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,220
the above insights from your data are

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,930
valuable potentially worth thousands of

00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,580
dollars a year

00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:54,160
boob tees private match technology

00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,200
protects your privacy and identity it

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,330
also ensures you only see studies that

00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,369
are uniquely suited for you which means

00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,590
you aren't wasting time qualifying for

00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:05,230
studies or filling out long surveys your

00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:07,300
data can answer once you select a study

00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,580
your data does almost all of the work

00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,350
with a simple swipe data you have

00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,760
collected about yourself from apps and

00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,400
accounts like your social media

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,540
wearables and credit cards is analyzed

00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,240
right on your device

00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:21,040
only the anonymized aggregated findings

00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,080
like which coffee brands you purchase

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,720
most and how much you spend monthly on

00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,850
them are used to complete the study boob

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,310
tea uses the most advanced data

00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,560
encryption and security technology to

00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:34,570
safeguard you and your data your data

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,119
remains locked in a secure data vault

00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:39,640
called digi me where you hold the only

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,380
key you decide when to unlock your vault

00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,610
and privately share insights with

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,920
studies

00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,780
some studies include a few brief survey

00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,610
questions companies want to know

00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,950
additional things like why you prefer

00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,840
one brand over another or what you think

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,450
about a new product these studies

00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,790
generally pay even more you'll earn cash

00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,620
and OBD points every time you swipe to

00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:02,020
complete a study transfer cash

00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:04,000
immediately to your bank account and as

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,890
our community grows there will be more

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,260
and more exciting ways to catch in your

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:11,260
points for valuable benefits to get

00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,630
started go to decom it takes less than

00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:28,120
10 minutes to set up then sit back and

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:34,150
watch your data go to work for you OOP t

00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:35,860
is okay I go back we really need to I

00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:40,450
would like to have a more interactive

00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:42,430
session over a beer or later to answer

00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,800
any question that you have we are a

00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:47,140
private data sharing company that is

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,720
what we do we are practitioners in these

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:54,700
spaces nine years and let's pick with us

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,880
if you're interested to do more in this

00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:03,889
space thank you
