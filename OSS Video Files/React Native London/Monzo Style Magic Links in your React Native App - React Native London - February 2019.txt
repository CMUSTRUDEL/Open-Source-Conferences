Description: 
	Josh Warwick from Theodo

Learn how to create Monzo style magic links in React Native. In this talk I will run through the different technologies needed to produce a great authentication flow, explain the common pitfalls involved in implementing. Iâ€™ll also show how this can be used with services other than email, such as facebook messenger - which we used on a project at Theodo recently.
