Do you feel like you're always writing the same code over and over again?
Loading lists from an API, pagination, infinite scroll, handling loading and error states, checking for non-null values, etc.
Galette is a library that allows you to avoid repeating yourself while handling all of these patterns so that you can focus on your useful domain logic.
I will introduce you to the library with concrete examples.
