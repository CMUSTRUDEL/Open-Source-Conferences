Title: From Idea to React: Travltalk - React Native London - January 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-04
Playlist: React Native London
Description: 
	Travltalk CEO and Founder, Rhiannon shares how she took the idea for the Travltalk mobile application and content platform and turned it into a reality - through UX / UI, Marvel & Ionic prototypoing in the app store and why I then decided to rebuild in React Native in early 2018! At the time the React / Native framework was still very young. I will also talk through our tech stack and what was selected and why, the challenges we had and which mobile analytics platforms work best for us with React Native.

hi as we mention my name is Rhiannon and

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,950
I'm really excited to share with you

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,900
tonight the story of travel talk and how

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,759
we got here some of you may or might not

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,719
know that travel talk is a react native

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,990
app and it's my baby really so it's an

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,310
interesting thing to describe something

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,340
as your baby and actually I stopped

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,470
describing it as my baby about a year

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,150
ago because it became a company and a

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,029
lot of people started working for me and

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,910
over the time since I had this idea I

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:36,059
raised 650,000 pounds myself from

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,120
strangers not family or friends friends

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,489
came in a little bit at the end but over

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,550
the time since I first had the idea

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:47,010
which started back in 2015 there's been

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,039
about 80 different people that I've

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,870
managed and have worked through travel

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,000
talk not just developers obviously it's

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,070
a company so it's quite a big lots of

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,140
stuff going on but just give you a bit

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,030
of a background Who I am what I did why

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,640
I thought actually I could wake up one

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,020
day and take a an idea from my bedroom

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,369
to a mobile application so I actually

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,869
studied law and commerce at uni and then

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,630
I went traveling for three years

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,479
backpacking non-stop and I was pretty

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,680
cool it's like 10 dollars a day living

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,210
off of that and it kind of gave me this

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,400
true appreciation of the world up there

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,560
and always like I was noticing how

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,840
things were done differently and more

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,759
than anything like the interaction in a

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,470
hostel was something really cool you

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,140
just met all these different people so I

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,750
just sort of came away as we all do and

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,549
we travel with a real love of of that

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,900
sort of ability to meet perfect

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,360
strangers and suddenly be friends the

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,460
next day anyway travelling doesn't pay

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,840
the bills so I had to come to London at

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,040
some point I'm lucky enough to have a

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,799
British passport as well as an

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,799
Australian one and I didn't really know

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,250
what I was doing I was 26 and had these

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,110
degrees and I got into digital media and

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,700
creative agencies so I started out in a

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,490
social media agency at the time you can

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,250
place paid ads on Facebook or Twitter

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,159
and we actually worked on the knock your

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,200
account so but don't send me in and you

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,729
know App Store stuff there so it's a

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,860
totally different world of you know what

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,130
mobile is today and

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,010
anyway I went back to Australia for a

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,330
while and I kind of had been spending

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,520
all my time doing what you guys probably

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,290
described is more like the UX UI and the

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,600
front-end stuff and you know the overall

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,280
management and I kept on feeling guilty

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,660
really that I didn't have enough

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,730
understanding what developers was doing

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,830
and others actually my partner was a

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,240
developer for eight years so I was lucky

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,430
enough to kind of learn a bit about that

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,230
he was at Google at the end anyway I

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,550
kind of was like yeah but I want to know

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,740
more and I was hearing people doing

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,140
general assembly so I went did general

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,780
assembly and I at the time we studied

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,700
backbone reactor wasn't kind of like

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,080
mainstream thing at that point so I was

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,820
like that's pretty cool like I really

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,190
enjoy the fact that you can like render

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,020
things on a page a lot faster than you

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,030
know back in the day I've kind of grown

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,100
up without internet all the time right

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,410
so we had dial-up for a really long time

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,810
so the fact that you can like bring up

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,730
different you know versions of things

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,530
very quickly was really appealing so I

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,260
was like backbone sounds really cool and

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,610
that was it really and my relationship

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,140
broke down I came back to London and I

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,230
got into VR and that was really cool

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,600
because I was able to take you know my

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,760
understanding of different interactions

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,830
etc and use that in a different medium

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,930
but actually the story of travel talk

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,380
did start in 2015 just before I came

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,880
back to London just after was just

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,800
before I'd done general assembly really

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,220
and I did general assembly because I

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,290
wanted to kind of get more familiar with

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,630
you know what it took to develop and at

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,640
the time it started as a mobile a web

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,590
application and then it became a mobile

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,020
application but before I go on I just

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,510
wanted to talk about you know I'm not a

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,820
back-end suffer engineer and by no means

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,590
did I ever consider myself you know

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,780
technical enough to build my own app

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,520
because let's face it you know that's a

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,209
big jump from General Assembly to doing

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,670
that and my aunt was actually built in

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,080
react native by a development agency but

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,420
prior to that was an ionic version of

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,810
yeah but today I'm proud to say that I

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,970
do run all of our travel app in-house

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,880
with my lead developer Ahmed who is a

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,150
legend he's in Pakistan and he's worked

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,830
with us over you know the time but he

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,020
basically came full time from the middle

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,360
of October he's actually worked in react

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,240
native for quite a few years

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,400
he had another app called Blanc that he

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,110
worked for and you know he really has a

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,870
full stack engineer of course I couldn't

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,939
claim that I was standing here and able

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,000
to do everything myself without him of

00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:40,370
course so just in case you don't know

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,960
travel talk is an application created to

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,030
join those with the love of travel

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,319
across the globe inclusive of all

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,120
backgrounds cultures and nationalities

00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,460
to make the world a smaller place I

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,289
think that you know space at Boris

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,030
Johnson is our prime minister and we've

00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:54,770
just brakes added and we need something

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,409
out there that actually you know seeks

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,669
to sort of connect people regardless of

00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,960
their backgrounds and that's something

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:04,460
I'm really passionate about but

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,039
basically we're not just an app we're

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,539
also a web presence so a lot of people

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,370
don't realize that because we have a

00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:12,080
mobile app we don't they think that's

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,569
the sort of extent of the business but

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,180
actually we have a really burgeoning web

00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:19,250
platform and actually at the moment it's

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,110
got a WP back engine it's a wordpress

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,659
site and I kind of wrapped it up for a

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,830
hundred bucks and then connect to the

00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:28,610
back end obviously you can do that very

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,830
easily and you know started to invite

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,009
people to apply to be contributors and

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,779
since I set that up last year it's

00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,719
actually we've published 200 articles

00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:40,250
and had like over 200 applications to be

00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:42,740
contributors we look at all of them we

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,349
try and be very objective and yeah

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,909
probably have like about 20 live

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,620
contributors that I talk to at any one

00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,270
time just roaming the world telling you

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,979
where they are and you know we let

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,900
people write their own thing so I just

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,180
want to kind of clarify that while we

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,800
are a react native mobile app we're a

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,490
brand platform our name is travel talk

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,199
and basically you know together you can

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,750
have a seamless experience and we also

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,639
have a podcast and very soon we're

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,529
working on our next j/s kind of

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,569
application which enables us to really

00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:13,759
move all of our web stuff over to a

00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,729
react framework and then gives us the

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,319
ability to actually take what is a

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:21,139
mobile application only at the moment

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,539
and really bring that to what I call a

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,219
mobile web but also if you're a desktop

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,930
the same way that Instagram works you're

00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,349
able to interact with Instagram in a

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,189
limited way if you're on desktop

00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,779
basically you'll be able to do the same

00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:34,520
with travel talk of course we don't want

00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:36,060
people to suddenly start using travel to

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,620
a desktop and not mobile

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,240
so you know there's obviously a really

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,640
interesting thing that we can do to make

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,290
sure that we still encourage people to

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,570
jump onto the mobile app so they can't

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,950
chat or create cards on web but

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,120
obviously they can view cards because

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,190
it's really important that we get more

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,290
users into our app and I'm proud to say

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,090
at the moment we've got 12,000 real

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,830
users in our app it's not as many as I

00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,110
would have liked but we actually had a

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,790
bumper a period in October last year we

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,550
went from seven-and-a-half thousand

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,530
users to yeah basically twelve thousand

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,480
users just in 20 days and we got a 70

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,810
page cost per download which is pretty

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,860
good but yeah as I said I'm here to kind

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,250
of just give you a bit of a background

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,500
of where Java talk began and maybe a lot

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:22,330
of you don't know but it actually began

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,910
as a ionic app so I just wanted to kind

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,670
of give you a little I don't know if

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,580
anyone sees Marvel like recently because

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,350
it's quite old now but basically this is

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,990
kind of where we were back in the day

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:41,080
and I've got these wireframes done by my

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,970
UX UI team spruce design of work with

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,130
them since 2015 so they've done all the

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,310
wireframes and interaction design for me

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,500
all along both from the ionic app and

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,710
the react native app but basically this

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,450
was like 2015 I was thinking about our

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,950
content platform not on mobile site and

00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,990
I thought oh we may as well just do a

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,400
mobile app to kind of like raise

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,450
awareness of the content site and I look

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,370
back and I'm like hahaha

00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,500
like you just do a mobile app but

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,080
basically these wireframes had done and

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,160
because I decided to come back to London

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,370
and had a bit of a relationship

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,710
breakdown actually it just got pushed by

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,060
the wayside and I got into VR so this is

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,060
actually what travel talk looked like a

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:22,450
very very long time ago in 2015 anyway

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,430
what came next was actually four

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,560
wireframes for their ionic version of

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,870
the app so this was kind of like the

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,550
design and I really knew what I wanted I

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,410
was like okay basically I want an app

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,090
that's very similar to tinder because I

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,860
could see the popularity of tinder and I

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,750
think sometimes developers obviously

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,490
think very functionally but when you've

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,990
kind of worked in creative agencies and

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,669
media agencies for a really long time

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,560
you have to think about into end product

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,420
management and I'm just a really big fan

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,130
of that and obviously every founder

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,240
loves Steve Jobs and thinks that they

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,680
want to be them but

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,360
obviously what he did really well is

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,700
understand what Apple needed in terms of

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,080
an ecosystem and you know we all know

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,240
that you can't really have one Apple

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,100
device you have to have a mole and you

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,750
know some people are in favor of that

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,010
and some people aren't but the fact of

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,080
the matter is if you don't understand

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,339
what you're doing from day one and how

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,930
that's going to manifest you probably

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,270
aren't going to do so well when it comes

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,930
to building a product or actually being

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,850
able to connect with your audience

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,470
because your audience and their users

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,060
are going to use your application in a

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,260
much different way than you tend to want

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,360
to develop it they don't really care

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,060
what's in it actually they care what it

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,709
looks like and help perform so basically

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,570
I was very clear I was like I want an

00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:27,430
app that mimic some of the best customer

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,080
experience of tinder but I wanted to

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,880
send her around the idea that first you

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,380
could meet people but also you could

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,240
help travelers do things like split

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,610
costs and sell items that they no longer

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,800
need I've constantly found myself with a

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,779
saucepan as I'm leaving a camping site

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,980
and New Zealand I'm thinking I just have

00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,230
to leave this on the side of the road

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,000
because worth twenty dollars who we

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,100
still want to buy it but no one wanted a

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,750
saucepan so my app actually allows you

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,790
to sell saucepan it allows you to split

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,260
costs if you you know arrive in Bangkok

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,430
and you're like I bet a whole bunch of

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,370
people got off this plane right now I

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,779
want to go down to coast down road and

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,250
you can actually find them so you bot

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,500
obviously helps you get in the taxi but

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,329
we can actually help you find people to

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,920
jump in that river with who are right

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:08,500
there next to you and obviously meeting

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,940
yes it's a bit like tinder but certainly

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,890
as a solo female traveler and I've

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,279
traveled to 80 countries myself with a

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:18,070
backpack alone and I got like got Harry

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,690
and Harry along the way and basically

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,579
yeah just as a solo traveler people are

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,380
now using tinder to connect with people

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,060
nearby but I don't really think so

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,680
that's awesome because you know it's

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,320
just nice to meet someone sometimes with

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,850
very sexual connotations especially when

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,510
you're traveling in a foreign country by

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:37,240
yourself so anyway I was also seeing

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,520
Latin media there increase because we

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,410
did a lot I worked at oMG you can my my

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,060
client was in town we had McDonald's and

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,230
McDonald's has so much money they can do

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,360
all sorts of stuff right so a direct

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,310
location-based service stuff serving

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,029
people push notifications this is like

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:55,149
in 2013 right Wow and I was like okay

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:57,940
this solo mode thing I'm on earth you

00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,430
see the feature so anyway I really

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,850
wanted to do an app that had vocation

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,470
services because I

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,509
knew that when people moving around the

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,069
world obviously people have their phone

00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,540
with them and I wasn't lucky enough to

00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,769
travel with a phone when I first heard

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,269
it and it was really annoying and then

00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,620
suddenly started traveling with a phone

00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:16,100
and I'm like wow I can open this phone

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,240
and I can get around you know I can open

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,560
it I can get an uber in a foreign

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,600
country I can also find where I'm going

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,459
so I knew delays location services are

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,660
very important and also know how how

00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,310
much people just want to chat but

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,880
obviously they need to meet each other

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,709
first

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,899
we don't want tinder so you know

00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:33,649
basically that was how this came about

00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:36,529
so suddenly you know you can see the

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:39,069
first workings if you like of of my app

00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:43,069
it is all wired up but I'm not going to

00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:46,370
cause you too much that I'm gonna do

00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:49,040
this again because it was okay so

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:53,620
basically what happened is the designs

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,720
were done in May 2017 but at the time I

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,600
got a job at HTC vive as the marketing

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,190
director for a mia and they had a rule

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,500
that I wasn't allowed to have another

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,180
business so I find I thought well that's

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,910
the Caddy because this might not work

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,339
out and basically the guys that did the

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,769
wireframes I I coated the first version

00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,569
of an ionic app I sort of just did a

00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,279
tutorial and say first of about ten

00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,899
thousand dollars but they agreed that

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,779
they would basically go from the

00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,759
wireframes to building the ionic app by

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,459
product managing the outsourcing of that

00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,800
- I tell us oft in India and basically

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,060
we were just playing on delivery and so

00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,040
I got to the end of December and

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,319
actually I left vibe and it just so

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,819
happened that the ionic version of the

00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,959
app was out in the App Store now you

00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:38,540
might think wow that was a pretty easy

00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,579
ride looking back it was actually and

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,750
and you know spruce with fantastic they

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:43,370
they took me through everything

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,569
I added everything it was a really

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,019
simple app at that stage you didn't

00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:50,649
really have much in it and that was kind

00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:53,839
of the problem for me I was sort of like

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,720
well I love the idea that ionic works

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,029
for two two platforms with one codebase

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,079
like that's phenomenal but I was

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,370
noticing when I was doing all the

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,839
testing and stuff that it was a bit

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,420
buggy on the front end and it was bit

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,329
like those lag and it just wasn't like

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,540
that nice user bouncy experience and I

00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,279
sort of looked into a bit more and I

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,889
also thought the brand and a bit of a

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,509
refresh cuz you only get one chance

00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,879
you know when you have an idea and

00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,889
basically you want to make it work and

00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,480
if you can't future proof yourself

00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,480
someone will come in over the top so I

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,739
sort of had a look around and most my UX

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,439
UI team said have you heard of react

00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:32,230
native and this is the beginning of 2018

00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:34,839
it was still in its infancy and he said

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,369
why don't why don't you have a look at

00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,109
it with the redesign because what we

00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:39,850
could do is we could do a brand redesign

00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:42,549
but we could do it in a way that is

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,839
really conducive for react native and I

00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,459
read up about it I was like oh my god

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,259
like the state changes are incredible

00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,519
apologies ever do get the terminology

00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,980
wrong I'm across a lot of things I'm

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,709
actually across about 75 pieces of tech

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,109
as advant for myself and obviously I'm

00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:57,999
it helps but basically what really

00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:59,769
appeals to me ironically for anyone who

00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:01,359
understands is the lightweight middle

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,220
aware and I knew of this thing called

00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:04,179
Redux and I was like oh my god so you

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,129
don't have to make all these server

00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,509
calls that's amazing because if you

00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,829
think about it when you're swiping you

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:11,350
don't really want to interact

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:13,660
necessarily with that card or that

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,189
person until you decide to so why would

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,109
you want you know to constantly make

00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,819
these calls so wow this readout thing

00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:20,829
looks really interesting and then you

00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:22,299
know as I said whatever Instagram does

00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:24,730
I'm not gonna lie I sort of take their

00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:27,040
lead because they have a lot of money so

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,269
they tend to invest a fair bit and we

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,459
all know that react native comes from

00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:32,319
Facebook so when I heard that that

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,059
framework was from Facebook I thought

00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:35,709
well I'm willing to bet on that and

00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:37,089
definitely all the developers at the

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,459
time were pretty excited about it

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,529
I didn't know much about it but what I

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:42,730
did do you just to really understand it

00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:45,850
better is I did a little react native

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,399
app of my own called manager on unity

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,019
but end-to-end had a bit of fun and boom

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,480
I was using Expo and everything it was

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,089
literally a toy app I mean it took 6

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,230
hours to do and I thought I knew that I

00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,669
didn't know anything about mobile

00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,259
development but I took it to my new

00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:01,329
developers to show them that I had real

00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,249
enthusiasm and a real desire to get

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:05,529
involved in in what I wanted to do and

00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:07,569
finally you know at the end of the day

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,389
I'm not saying it's cheap to build in

00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:12,549
react native you guys cost a lot but

00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,069
basically it's actually really cheap to

00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:17,889
run so our app has was built and

00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:19,149
completed in June 2018 and it went out

00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,850
into the App Store so it's been out

00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:24,039
there for a year and a half and after it

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,630
was built I actually left the original

00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,580
team that built it

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,470
and went to another agency eventually

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,570
went in-house and in the end we all know

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,040
that the person who developed the app

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,420
originally tends to sort of understand

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,060
the codebase you developers don't like

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,920
picking up other people's work so I sort

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,220
of thought look I got a hundred fifty

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,420
thousand pounds after I left the agency

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,400
and I suddenly had this money my bank

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,780
account as the sole founder yet 150 K in

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,690
a bank account only you own you know Ike

00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:52,060
holy and I was like wow I actually

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,290
can afford to have a real dev team and

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,110
there was a lot of modifications I

00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,160
wanted to do to the MVP it was a as I

00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,470
said it was a simple app but it was

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,780
working pretty well and you know we had

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,730
the beginnings of some tracking and

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,500
analytics I wanted like Mixpanel but I'd

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,020
also learned about branch and I was like

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,700
holy the deep linking technology is

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,290
amazing and we all know slack it's

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,970
pretty cool like magic link and I was

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,910
like that's what I want I want unit

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:19,300
users to be able to sign up that way now

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,650
so basically I realized that it was

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,380
really cheap to roam because suddenly I

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,570
had this MVP and it was all done and it

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,880
cost nothing to keep it going right like

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,890
unless you're developing new things cost

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,290
zero to run so that's why I actually

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,870
chose react native and it's a really big

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,430
deal because I had a hole in both app

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,010
stores both the Google Play and the

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,350
Apple Store in ionic that looks exactly

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,670
the same or not looks but it was

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,050
designed the interaction was designed

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,750
exactly the same way obviously what was

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,540
inside was different and that's why I

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,270
chose react native now I sort of just

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,530
gone on and on about the backstory but

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,540
maybe you want to know what travel talk

00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,460
does it's a really simple app and that

00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,070
was the idea from the beginning it's

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,690
just got a really simple data schema

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,910
basically have a user a user can have a

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,360
click create a card the user also has a

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,550
profile obviously we have a location you

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,990
can search by location you can chat and

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,060
finally we have this extra feature where

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,470
you can plan and book obviously I really

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,300
wanted to develop out the planning and

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,770
the booking side of things but because

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,199
of a few things that happen along the

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,760
way we didn't get there so we're a bit

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,709
behind in certain features certainly

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,680
about onboarding and stuff like that but

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,000
we're in a really exciting place and as

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,150
I said it was modeled on the popularity

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,230
of swiping and finally look investors

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,090
don't like to hear that you've got an

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,460
app that's not making any money and I

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,640
knew that from my days in media it's all

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,490
about the conversion

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,530
and if you can get to that fastest

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,840
cost-per-click then obviously you have a

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,970
customer so in-app purchase was becoming

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,490
really popular one of my best friend's

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,100
husband's his mobile gamer he did bike

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,120
baron if anyone knows but basically they

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,070
were making a lot of money with in-app

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,560
purchases I mean the amount money people

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,120
buy all those things is incredible but I

00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,790
thought why don't we make it functional

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,140
so actually Java talk is free to

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,300
download in your current country and you

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,700
can use it to change cities within that

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:11,180
country but if you do want to see cars

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,220
from cities before you land and chat to

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,590
people before you're there then it's a

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,090
99p in-app subscription process and it's

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,890
just with a couple of taps as we know

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,620
it's pretty easy and and that's how I

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,030
get a customer and obviously depending

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,580
on who hears that they might sound like

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,700
what but I've found recently that

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:31,730
certainly we call them gems ed

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,500
snowflakes who else but they like to pay

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,690
for things they value and I believe that

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,610
Travis work is a useful app and actually

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,650
people will pay for something that they

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:43,490
find useful so basically I made this

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,900
video back in February last year because

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,130
I understand how to work with animators

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,450
the whole thing cost me a thousand

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,060
pounds to make we have a lot of assets

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:53,060
that we were use obviously and all the

00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,820
design etc was kind of like my vision

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,020
and leading up with with the react

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,090
native developer so that's kind of how

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:05,090
it works and then I think I mentioned

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:08,840
the the the wireframes actually of the

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:11,750
new app so they have a like quite a busy

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,070
envision board here but this was sort of

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,050
mentioned that we did some new

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,060
wireframes after the ionic version and

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,190
this is what basically I took to my

00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,960
developers when I was interviewing them

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,220
and said you know here's the ionic

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,660
version of the app and here all the

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,420
wireframes that I've done in the

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,570
redesign of the brand with Europe with

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,040
my UX UI team spruce so basically I was

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,590
looking for a react native developers

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,470
that could take my product and follow

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,170
these design instructions and you know I

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:43,460
was lucky enough to find one that could

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:45,290
for my budget and obviously you know I'm

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,990
not going to pretend that the tech

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,549
inside my app isn't amazing it really is

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,480
I learned about it recently especially

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:55,070
the back end and basically in case you

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,169
wonder what what it sort of made up of

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,509
because I'm very very aware that this is

00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:01,580
maybe not a technical and I favor the

00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:03,440
react native made up but I hope this is

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,759
the first thing many I can give so I'm

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,999
just really excited to be part of this

00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:11,450
audience but basically we have a travel

00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:14,119
talk API which is connected by a polar

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,559
server we have a travel talk a perk lab

00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,690
which is naturally built in react native

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:22,309
and we're slowly building out our travel

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:24,080
talk web we have an admin panel for our

00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,049
CMS and as I said where we're starting

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,789
to develop out the mobile web version

00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:32,629
we've also just recently finished our

00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:33,740
travel talk design manager story book I

00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:35,179
learned a little bit more about the

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,399
relationship between Storybrooke node

00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:39,919
and obviously how it all comes together

00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:42,049
and gets applied to project and Google

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,600
cloud cloud platform which I've also

00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:46,940
recently found out more about and as I

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,259
said we use envision for UX UI and

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,869
obviously a lot of Photoshop and

00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:53,090
InDesign which I became an expert in by

00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:55,539
accident and then you know from a brand

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,009
perspective cloud flares and awesome

00:20:55,539 --> 00:21:01,580
hosting platform for domains don't use

00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:05,330
GoDaddy and now don't Sh

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:08,869
AWS database we've been with that since

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,990
I left that agency the first time around

00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:13,580
sort of August and firebase which I

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,559
found out is a really nice tool and

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,539
graphic UL which I think Abby's going to

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,490
talk a bit more about and as I said on

00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:22,249
web at the moment we've got a WP engine

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,659
back-end still for our WordPress site we

00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,889
use air table I don't know if anyone's

00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:27,379
familiar with that for all about

00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:29,059
editorial planning and sort of have an

00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:30,350
input on our web site where people can

00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,940
sign up we have an automated process

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,559
where people get an email and then we

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,360
consider them we use MailChimp and

00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,480
zapier so that was kind of our makeshift

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,929
freeze the Ahram that cost us nothing

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,490
and actually on the tracking and

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:45,080
analytics front so when you're working

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,059
in a media agency it's all about the

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,190
tracking analytics we use one of my

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:50,269
clients is to be per Joe and they wanted

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,909
to know everything how many downloads

00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:55,220
what they did what you did Lola this is

00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:57,409
like 2013 and there just wasn't any

00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,600
tracking on my vows bit perfect really

00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:01,190
you'd spend clients money and you'd be

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,440
like yeah we can't really tell you what

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,510
what happened I just think it did really

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,460
well and they're like what like there's

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,250
no tracking on mobile yet and obviously

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,430
since I left in 2013 and when I actually

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,130
came back in sort of 2018 it had changed

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,570
quite a lot now I think it was

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,430
introduced that a justice sponsoring

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,580
tonight and I just want to explain to

00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:24,140
you you know why I made the decisions I

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,750
did about the traffic and analytics so

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,520
you know we have Mixpanel I didn't

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,760
really know much about firebase engraft

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,750
job manager until very recently but I

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,430
really pushed to get mixed panel

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,150
integrated and we did a proper

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,890
integration of that in January 2019 it

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,290
cost me seven a half thousand dollars a

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,940
year and that means that you can

00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,640
obviously access a lot of information

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,350
about your data then as I mentioned I

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,090
wanted to go with branch for deep

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,560
linking and we did set it up and we had

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,440
it fully operational as also an

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,730
enterprise client for branch and you

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,290
know it did some really cool things I

00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,810
think a lot of people using mobile have

00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:02,840
used branch and then I sort of lie it

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:05,330
was like yeah but actually I want a kind

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,650
of dashboard that I can say in apps

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,600
while I was quite popular so I put an

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,190
Apps fire and I wasn't really happy with

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,170
that and then I saw these lovely guys

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,670
that are just I can't tell you enough

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:17,300
how nice this move are and that really

00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,040
makes a huge difference but also they're

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,080
the product is simple and it's

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,210
engineered really well they'll say

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,420
themselves they're German by design

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,770
right and basically it's it's a really

00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,240
interesting product it does media

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,950
attributions for those of you that don't

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,080
know you're gonna spend a whole bunch of

00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,460
money online you really want to

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,200
understand where it goes I use Google

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,150
Ads manager and Facebook business but

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,040
actually having to use you know Apple

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,270
search and all those other platforms is

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,610
a bit confusing when you're just trying

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,900
to you know you want first you want to

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,000
understand who your audience is but you

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,770
also want to retarget them and you know

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,390
it is important if you can to understand

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,420
their device IDs because that helps you

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:57,320
in the longer run so actually a just is

00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:59,510
a really great platform for media

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,580
attribution analytics but also in fraud

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,530
prevention you know one of the things

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,210
that certainly startups get in trouble

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,040
for if they want to try and prove their

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,690
metrics by just saying look at all the

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,950
installs we got well if they don't

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,620
convert to signups

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,130
then you're not really doing very well

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,630
and also there could be a lot of

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,970
like fake install so I'm really proud to

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,420
say we have a 60% installed a sign-up

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,340
rate for travel talk and it's really

00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,840
cool to see the interactions when we do

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,550
run media we haven't been able to run it

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,850
since October unfortunately because

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:31,470
budget wise we got cleaned out but yeah

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,390
it's just fascinating because when you

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,010
actually pay a bit of money you see that

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,330
happen and then you can sort of get this

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,490
full visibility it helps you better

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,230
understand your customers and that's

00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,100
really what's so passionate about having

00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,570
the best-in-class

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,670
tracking and analytics within my app

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,690
because I really cared about my users I

00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,610
wanted to understand what they were

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,560
doing I wanted to understand what they

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,820
liked what they didn't like and look a

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,020
lot of people go over the top would you

00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,300
use a testing because you can ask people

00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,310
to you're blue in the face but this

00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,960
started in 2015 for me and I wouldn't

00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,550
stop talking about it so I can tell you

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,120
can spent pretty much every day of my

00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:06,120
life he's a testing until I ended up you

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,190
know pretty much in the position I am

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,530
now so it's really the the quantitative

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,090
analytics that are most interesting to

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,830
some degree because once you start to

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,640
get those big numbers and obviously we

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,220
shouldn't be looking at people

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,340
individually because I shouldn't really

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,800
be giving you the insight you want so

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,810
finally I just want to show you the

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,800
travel talk design system manager that

00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:30,600
we built out so really proud you know

00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,260
bit by bit we've just got as I said

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,480
we're about to do the web design so this

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,940
is what that's looking like so I had

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,990
that up before so yeah this is this is

00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,990
something that we're going to be

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:45,270
launching I was hoping it would be in

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,250
the next sort of week or so but now that

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,100
I better understand how we can structure

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,440
our schema for this we're going to pause

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,790
a little bit and you know make sure that

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,530
we can do that the better to the best of

00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:59,820
our ability but as you can see sort of

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:01,430
in our design system manager we have you

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,680
know all the sorts of components

00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:06,570
sponsored cars suggesting cards images

00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:10,350
so just it just makes everything super

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:13,980
easy for future development and again

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,420
that was my UX UI team spruce they're

00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,470
pretty good front-end developers and

00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,420
they're the ones as I said that

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:21,090
suggested react to me so they've always

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,500
been like really good every time I was

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,400
sort of like yeah we need this and

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,930
that's what I want

00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,460
didn't have to kind of give them too

00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,360
many complicated briefs they just kind

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,510
of came back

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,179
and and we weren't really well together

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,679
so yeah that's kind of a bit of a like

00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,900
long way of showing you all sorts of

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,870
stuff but I just want to say you know

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,460
what next as I mentioned you know we've

00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,470
got the web launched for the content and

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,120
then we're following up with the mobile

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,960
web interface that's kind of what its

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,280
gonna look like as I said we mimic

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,500
Instagram in many ways because if you go

00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:56,010
to Instagram you can view photos but you

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,770
can't actually upload a photo or start a

00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,030
chat so what we do and this is obviously

00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,410
investors don't want to hear that you're

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,150
just going to let spend them your money

00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,250
on paid media and get users that way you

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,929
have to worry about like organic gross

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,669
and I've always worried about that for

00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,960
day one and that's why I sort of created

00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,970
the content platform and the podcast

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,500
because that kind of becomes content

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,750
fuel people love talking about traveling

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,360
but obviously if I can push them on

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,010
website to a little bit of a taster of

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,290
our app and you can see cards you can

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,450
search by location you can see what's

00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,850
nearby then obviously what you might do

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:28,830
is think oh I want to talk to Alice or

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,210
you know I can save that card you can

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,160
save that on the web version but you

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,870
actually want to chat to Alice you would

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,490
have a prompt to chat obviously we've

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,710
got a mobile web that would be pretty

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,270
easy if you're not on mobile web have to

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,559
think a little bit about how we gonna

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:45,020
create that experience but that's really

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,760
exciting and yeah basically that's all

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,679
so that so that we hope the content in

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,059
the way but mobile web interface can

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,020
come out you know within the next month

00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:57,210
or so it's a bit budget dependent but

00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,919
actually I you know I'm really confident

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,020
now with ahmud we're doing really great

00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,940
job together spending quite a few hours

00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,100
a day doing bits and pieces because it's

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,690
just the two of us and yeah I've

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,250
discovered a whole new world of Apollo

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,710
and I'm really excited about that

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:13,740
because I actually did pure mathematics

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:17,280
and statistics at university and I just

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,720
love what you can do with data and to

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,840
discover what I can do it's pretty

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,549
exciting and finally you know what we

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,870
need to do because that app was left in

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:27,360
an interesting state we didn't have any

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:30,750
automated testing or detox testing or

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,530
bug reporting so unfortunately it's a

00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:36,870
bit silly but yeah I guess we didn't

00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,910
have the best testing setup to my

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,830
knowledge anyway so I just really want

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,750
to get better at that

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,190
just want to make sure that you know now

00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,769
that we have these tools we can do as

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,690
much as possible on the user testing

00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:48,980
analysis analytics front because that

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,679
it's kind of why I did it in the first

00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,890
place oh it's a pretty big risk to quit

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,480
a well-paid job and obviously just going

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,070
hell-for-leather on a mobile app I work

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,230
16 hours a day and it I'm much of a life

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,390
but you know I got to travel all that

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,309
time so I thought so fair fair trade-off

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:07,010
all I'll build an app for the world that

00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:08,870
enables everyone else to travel but yeah

00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:11,799
basically I just want to make sure that

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:15,649
we can really understand how to use

00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:17,450
graph manager and really sort of God

00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:20,059
that bad things amazing anyway and

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,070
finally you know if you do download our

00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:23,210
app you'll probably see that we could

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,850
definitely do a lot of things better

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,730
when it comes to onboarding you know

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,320
making a bit better experience I know

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,210
that there are so many things that we

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,580
could do I also know that I'm far from

00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,620
perfect and we're lucky there still be

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:40,100
standing and I'm really proud of what we

00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,870
have but you know what I really love to

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,730
say is that I am here to stay in the

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,679
react native community and I can't wait

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:48,470
to do some more coding really proud of

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,090
how much better I got at it lately but I

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,639
really want this to be a bit of a

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,850
community project like I've learned so

00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:57,860
much this and it's fun actually it's

00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,960
it's all bunch of tech in when you get

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,600
to see like the back end of 75 different

00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,000
platforms you've learned a lot and I've

00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,279
always been quite passionate about

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,500
helping younger people who are on the

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,380
way up right because I didn't really I

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,389
guess people helped me a lot and I was

00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,190
always grateful to them and I think it's

00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:18,380
very rare that you get the privilege of

00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,940
seeing an end-to-end product because

00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,830
usually as developers you get hired to

00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,510
work on one particular thing and that

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,850
means you see that in a silo but you

00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,679
don't actually see what it takes to

00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:31,429
bring it all together and it's a lot of

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,889
work and also how that you can sort of

00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:36,169
use that knowledge to think of new

00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:38,330
things so basically I just want to

00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,880
invite anyone out there and the react

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:43,480
Native community or react jeaious to get

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,639
in touch I'm always open to new ideas I

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,080
really want to you know share our

00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:49,399
learnings maybe even make some of this

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,160
stuff open-source I don't I don't know

00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:54,640
the rules there yeah so I've got really

00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,650
- too much I know that you know certain

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,300
things can be a resource certain things

00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,640
you might want to keep private but for

00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,520
me what makes me happy is the idea that

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,470
this application can brave life and be

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,090
out there in the world and be used by

00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,680
the very people that I designed it for

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,020
these awesome travelers like-minded

00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,300
people but more importantly I was just a

00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,010
little bit of a school project once upon

00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,660
a time because I thought hey I've done a

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,100
general assembly course and I'm working

00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,770
in these companies and I'm being paid

00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,720
big money to talk about doing all this

00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,240
stuff for other brands and I just want

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,560
to do that for myself and really I did

00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,510
that with the desire of being a product

00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,540
manager for my own company my own brand

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,220
it getting closer to the tech and

00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:35,320
basically I've had the chance to do it

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,840
and I'd love ever anyone else out there

00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,160
who you know has an interest maybe we

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,810
can do some hackathons maybe we can

00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,640
catch up a bit but like please get in

00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,900
touch and you know I get hundreds and

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,190
hundreds of emails every day right now

00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,720
do you want this do you need to develop

00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,160
her if you need that but what I care

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,100
most about is just people really

00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,960
interested in learning and sharing and

00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,820
you know that's what community is about

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,490
right so hope I didn't bore you all

00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,060
today thank you for listening and that's

00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:05,140
the story of childhood

00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:05,140
