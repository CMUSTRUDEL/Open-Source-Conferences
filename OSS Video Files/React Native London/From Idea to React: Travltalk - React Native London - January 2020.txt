Title: From Idea to React: Travltalk - React Native London - January 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-04
Playlist: React Native London
Description: 
	Travltalk CEO and Founder, Rhiannon shares how she took the idea for the Travltalk mobile application and content platform and turned it into a reality - through UX / UI, Marvel & Ionic prototypoing in the app store and why I then decided to rebuild in React Native in early 2018! At the time the React / Native framework was still very young. I will also talk through our tech stack and what was selected and why, the challenges we had and which mobile analytics platforms work best for us with React Native.
