Title: From Custom Hardware to Android TV and Beyond - React Native - July 2019
Publication date: 2019-07-31
Playlist: React Native London
Description: 
	Presented by Vali N. (MagicWorks)

ROXi application is built to work on all platforms with the same codebase, and therefore requires our React Native app to support touch displays, pointing devices (HID) as well as TV remotes. The topic covers a general overview of how we achieved this and our plans to take it to more platforms.

okay hi everybody thanks for joining

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:11,990
today after Conrad raised the bar so

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:16,260
high with the magic we are doing here

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:19,439
I'm going to talk a little bit about how

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,990
you can take some of the magic if you

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,840
want back home and you know play with

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,529
your TV instead of I don't know watching

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,599
talk shows so I'm going to talk about

00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:34,579
how we're going to move from custom

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,140
hardware to Android TV and and beyond

00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:40,530
what I'm going to cover today will be

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,809
will be the custom hardware what is

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,989
Android TV and why should we develop for

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,140
it how we are going to think slightly

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,870
different because obviously TVs and and

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,940
smartphones are different how we're

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,520
going to use react native with Android

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,289
TV and how we're going to to start

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:05,030
developing on it our custom hardware so

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:08,250
Conrad didn't show you the internals

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:11,750
essentially where we just have a hundred

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:17,820
border it's nothing special the

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:20,369
electronics you see are on the on the

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,710
bottom is only used for the voice part

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,890
because if we are using the Bluetooth so

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,450
for the microphone it has a lag so if we

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,250
want to do a real karaoke at home

00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:38,189
bluetooth will not gonna help so this is

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:42,420
an RF module with ADC and sound

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:45,689
processing so the sound audio is

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,200
streamed digitally to the Android but

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:53,659
anything than that the controller is

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,490
using bluetooth for for the movement so

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,369
essentially we're we're just having an

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,770
Android phone there

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,869
what is Android actually we have two

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,979
choices on the Android TV either you

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,440
just get the normal media player's for I

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,190
don't know something between 20 and 50

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,480
pounds or you get

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:21,140
embedded media player in in the TV

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,910
itself saving you know an extra remote

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,890
which probably is annoying you know

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,880
having all the remotes all over the

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,920
places in terms of market share every

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,160
year we're growing and growing and

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,480
obviously today we find in the in the

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:43,730
shops you know 4k and its mainstream to

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,400
have full HD TVs and probably I don't

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,160
know what will will happen but I don't

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,620
think it you can find anything less than

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,160
a Smart TV today so either you will have

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:59,420
you know like Samsung or Android TVs but

00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:02,360
that's in terms of the do s share

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,930
obviously Android is a having its lion

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,030
part but also Tizen from Samsung be

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,850
there I don't know if you know they will

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:14,510
continue this way and I have a web boys

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,930
have slightly smaller share so Android

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:20,900
is is still leading and it will probably

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:25,040
swallow the whole thing so why aren't

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,650
you a TV first it's a it's a larger

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,480
screen so you know you don't have to

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:34,280
worry about your Excel not fitting the

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:37,700
phone like we saw in well-doing excel on

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,970
TV it's rather peculiar so I don't do

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,100
that at home at least it's a good reason

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,840
to us for a TV at office on the other

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:50,930
hand so yeah you can really share

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,090
real-life experience you know so that's

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,239
completely different than you know try

00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:00,050
to get your life from the from the from

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,080
the phone itself and less small biz you

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,470
know what's more bizarre anybody small

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:10,080
biz well yeah

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:14,290
spoiler ones mobis are actually you know

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,560
smart mobile zombies which are glue to

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,680
the to their headsets and they're

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:25,540
hitting and you know damaging cars or

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,510
over places so definitely when we're

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,270
trying to you know develop for for

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,590
Android TV that's not how this will look

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:41,620
like so we need to really think

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:45,310
different and yeah so what I what I mean

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,950
port see a thing different first one

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,020
first of all that think about the

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,320
smartphone without touch we don't really

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,680
touch TVs you know unless you are like

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,930
18 years old 18 months old sorry and

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,560
touching everything and parents need to

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,220
move things upstairs so you don't really

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,680
touch you

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,140
everything is focus oriented so if you

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,450
play it with TVs you just crawl and then

00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,820
as Conrad was saying you just have this

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,390
elements focused which are kind of you

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:20,020
know zooming in you and then of course

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,330
if you have large screens you it's it's

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,930
it's a good idea to have very good

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:30,850
quality background images like you

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:33,790
notice on our up and obviously even if

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,760
we have the keyboards in our app we try

00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:40,419
to avoid it as much as possible so for

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,480
instance you can you can bring on our on

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,610
our app the photos from your Facebook

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,160
but how are going to do it definitely

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,660
we're not asking you to log in with user

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,840
and password because it will take like

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,630
maybe two weeks or something so it's the

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,970
other way around you just get a code on

00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,520
your screen and you punch your code in

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,640
your mobile app or on your desktop and

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,490
then the two are linked in behind the

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:11,010
scene and Jane then you get the pictures

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:14,770
in the in the TV you know and obviously

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,289
for the Smart TVs even if you can't do

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,289
karaoke you still can use a microphone

00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,800
over Bluetooth

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:23,960
from the remote control you know to to

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,729
have comments like you know search you

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,639
know play music whatever you want

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:32,960
so microphone is a good input and with

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:38,270
you know the the latest achievements in

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:42,319
in machine learning with NLP things are

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,000
getting pretty pretty nice and obviously

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,949
use recommendation how many of you have

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,550
Smart TVs at home oh okay so you better

00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:55,069
hurry okay so the first line in the

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,169
internet Android TVs the recommendations

00:06:55,069 --> 00:07:02,090
so it's very useful to you know get all

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:04,520
get a spot there and the the the sub

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,289
second clients are actually the spots

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,560
for for your application you probably

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:16,479
notice Roxy I don't know if this is will

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:21,319
be the latest you know logo and icon but

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:24,969
this is how it will look like in terms

00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,340
of development Android came with this

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:31,879
what they call lean back support library

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,610
but as you probably notice Android is

00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,610
not like leading the graphical

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,909
development in this world so everything

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:44,000
if you if you loo use this library all

00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:48,560
the application will probably look the

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,849
same and I don't know so what's what's

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,759
the alternative

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:56,949
let's try to use a rag native an Android

00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:02,659
TV and how it's going to do that

00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:04,219
starting rag native 55 0.55 this support

00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:07,099
is already there so you don't have to

00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:09,039
really do anything most of the

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:13,849
application are working of the shelves

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:16,759
so there are some small things which you

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:20,449
might need to do it in order to make it

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:25,520
real application I mean real intuitive

00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:27,349
via apps but just you know install the

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,770
application on a TV and it will just

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:34,520
work and obviously can be published

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:38,419
in google play just need to to mention

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,620
that it's an android it's for TV

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:46,730
you probably remember again the how how

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:49,490
different can a design look you know as

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,980
opposed to what you saw on on google so

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,959
no you know sharp corners and things

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,070
like that but morty stick and curved

00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:00,350
lines all over the places sorry

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,560
so we really need to use imagination

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:07,310
where when we are developing for for

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,940
android TV and when i am saying that we

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:15,110
need to use ad focus on the selectors

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:18,350
use the animated state full list either

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:23,180
you know horizontal like like you saw or

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:27,829
maybe 2d sync excel again focusable

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:30,740
components which are you know are

00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:34,370
brought to life when you you focus on

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,100
them and full screen again background

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,940
images also when we are talking about

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,920
interacting with with android TV this is

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,690
what we have either there is a very

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,240
complicated TV oriented remote control

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,820
of or a very Spartan way but all of them

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,810
have you know the what it called the

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,640
d-pad or directional pad controls with

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,800
the arrows left to right up and down

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,570
they have the back and the home control

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,910
and obviously the mic so when you are

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,070
doing that you kind of you know try to

00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,380
have like a common denominator but you

00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:16,670
always can take advantage of you know

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:20,329
rich remote control and hook on specific

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,610
buttons when it comes to navigation this

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:24,770
is how you do the navigation with a

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,700
remote control on Android TV so is there

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:32,000
a left right or up down with focus on on

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,209
the selected element's so how do we

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,250
start a below thing well first thing is

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,890
that you just get in the settings of the

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,290
TV so I believe that you spot the

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,030
settings on your Smart TV so just go

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,480
there in the about and

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,670
you go in the build press like 150 times

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,340
I don't know how nobody knows how many

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,950
times you need to press then then

00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,350
magically the development of developer

00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,260
options is popping up and then you just

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,970
enable the development mode probably you

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,310
did it so many times on your Android

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:09,290
that you know how to do it it's the same

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:12,430
in Android TV then you just need to

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,990
figure out what is the IP of your TV and

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:20,720
it should it comment there is ADB

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:22,760
connect the IP column and the port five

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,070
five five five I did you just get

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,610
connected and then by running your you

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:31,160
know very very well-known and a rare

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,850
native or an Android you just get your

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,460
app on the screen he's as simple as that

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,920
it's nothing special so there's a you

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:45,020
know the small magic you the rabbit how

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:49,250
it can get it from the the Hat now again

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:51,740
your app is just working fine if you do

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,990
that however if you want to take

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,230
advantage of you know having your app on

00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:00,050
the on the screen of the TV having its

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,750
own logo their icon the normal icon you

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:05,210
played so far is not enough so you need

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,550
to have in your application a couple of

00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:11,060
things first of all you need to mention

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:14,270
that the touch screen is not required so

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,610
the required is false also the

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:19,460
microphone is not required but it's

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:24,950
still there so maybe your app will be

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:27,590
able to to get you know the support from

00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,410
the mic also in the application and in

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,690
the in the activity you need to specify

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,620
the banner the logo in the label this

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:39,500
brings you the app on the on the front

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,120
on the home screen of the Android TV

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,790
otherwise you need to go in the settings

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,580
in the app list and run it from there

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,980
which is kind of annoying and also it's

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,290
important to have this category as a

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,780
Leanback launcher but that's the whole

00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,570
thing you need to mention your in your

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,260
money

00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:01,500
and the rest is just working now a

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,660
little bit of code so let's say for a

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,080
touchable opacity how you can you know

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,720
get on on the focus part you just have

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,640
to hook on on the three events the focus

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,770
on the blur and do whatever you want in

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,980
this case you just change the color of

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:19,200
the border of this button so nothing

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,180
special but you can come up with you

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,640
know a very fancy thing like corn show

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:30,150
you with a lot of animation a little lot

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:33,810
of things there we I mentioned earlier

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:37,260
the events on the on the key so you can

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:39,360
hook on top of the what you have in as

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,030
an events for your touch touchable

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,550
opacities you can directly hook on the

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:48,180
event so this is kind of the events you

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:51,450
get irrespective of the focus on blur

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,180
right so you have all the the direction

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,210
buttons the d-pad and you also have the

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,910
play stop the fast-forward or rewind or

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,390
the select when you select this so you

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,430
can build on top of that so the code is

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,010
very simple just hook on the TV event

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,330
handler it's ready it's already there in

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,240
the react native you don't have to do

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:15,830
anything special

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,480
when it comes to packages already

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:21,660
available packages which are working off

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,030
the shelf with Android TV it's worth

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,520
mentioning the react native voice which

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,710
is bringing the power of the microphone

00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,470
in your application so just you know

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:35,010
install this it's is there in the github

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:39,450
just install it and you have it you just

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:42,030
need to to start the voice on whatever

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:46,800
language but probably English is best

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:48,870
and then hook on the on speech result

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,210
handler so the value actually will

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:56,400
contain an array of strings of what they

00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:59,220
let's say the engine understand you

00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,930
spoke so if you say play Michael Jackson

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,790
to say first string is play Michael

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:06,000
Jackson the third one is play and

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,310
Michael something else and so on depends

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,690
on what

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:13,850
what the des algorithm understand

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,010
another one which is very very good and

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,400
very useful is react native music

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:22,550
control which is bringing on the

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,589
homepage even if your app is dormant so

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,020
it goes back into in the in the

00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:29,270
background you will still get a first

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,910
place in in the row of the

00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,560
recommendation just by feeling these

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,750
things and saying okay this is what

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,320
where it's going on right now it's

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:43,839
playing this music right so again

00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:50,510
another very useful package which is

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:53,900
working as is from from github now a

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:56,750
couple of goodies so you know when you

00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,279
develop with with Android you take the

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,890
phone you shake it and then you get the

00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,410
menu kind of you know annoying to shake

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:07,760
I mean we try a couple of times we broke

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:10,370
a couple of TV's so we stopped so then

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,280
you really need the menu you know to pop

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:16,100
up you just issue this adb shell input

00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:21,950
key key event from your from your laptop

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:24,230
and then you have menu pop up also you

00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:27,589
can have the back because obviously

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,750
don't have or maybe you can have it but

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:33,740
it's much easier to to do it on the on

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:37,250
the keyboard you can control the the

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,770
remote so you can issue let's say up

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,110
down whatever you can input text which

00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:46,640
is very useful if you want to really you

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:49,100
know subscribe to whatever this is how

00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,230
you use this the ADB to install the

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,080
application to run the application to

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,630
run the intent with a deep link if you

00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,560
want to you know have a development on

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:03,830
with zip link in this and always you can

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,199
pop up the settings of the of the TV

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,390
just by using so probably you have

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,550
already in mind that you can cover with

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,980
this these comments you can cover a lot

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:17,420
of you know integration tests you know

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:20,360
just have them from one site to another

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,140
have your app tested so that's the adb

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,380
goodies

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,030
this slide will be shared so you'll get

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,010
them okay

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,130
in terms of takeaway there is no better

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:35,000
time to start developing 480v think

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:38,210
about you know small bees you make

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,080
everybody a favor react native just

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:44,090
works so that's nothing special there be

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,150
creative when designing way for Android

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,600
TV so don't really just use a you know

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,950
the Google thing keep in mind that you

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,280
we don't have touch

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,410
we don't have keyboard well not so but

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,450
we you we have focus microphone and

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:07,310
background images and with a rare native

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:10,010
0-60 probably some of you know that the

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:13,270
the react native guys are moving to

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:17,000
Android X which contains a Leanback so

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:19,190
probably in the next period we might you

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,640
know get some of the fragments of the

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,670
Leanback framework in case you don't

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,590
want to spend more time in you know the

00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:33,770
designing fancy interfaces and with that

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:37,690
thank you very much for listening to me

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:43,660
if you have question I'm here
