	React Native Fundamentals for Brownfield iOS Apps
Karan Thakkar (@geekykaran) from Skyscanner

In this talk, Karan will share his learnings from working on the React Native infrastructure at Skyscanner. These are concepts and use-cases that a developer would encounter in their journey of integrating React Native in a brownfield app. Knowing these ahead of time would help folks take the right decisions when building their own React Native infrastructure.
