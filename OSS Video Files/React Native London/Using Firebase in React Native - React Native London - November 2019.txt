I probably have also gone a bit

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,450
overboard with my slide animations but

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,000
yeah so today if you have a guests I'll

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,900
be giving a talk on building your react

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,760
native apps with firebase and so if

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,850
you're wondering who I am

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,260
so my name is Mike obviously I'm a

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,010
software engineer and I've been

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,480
developing with JavaScript and a host of

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,900
other languages for a couple of years

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,210
now

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:36,450
I'm currently CTO and co-founder at

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,030
invertase so we're just a small software

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,460
engineering team based out of Manchester

00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,829
we have a strong focus on mobile dev

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,879
tooling kind of platform integration

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,030
solutions we develop bespoke software

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,739
for clients such as Google as well as

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,670
for our own products such as react

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,039
Nate's firebase she might have heard of

00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,879
you can find me on github and Twitter or

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,119
if you want you can drop me an email and

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,330
I'm also a Google developer expert for

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,490
firebase so feel free to ask me any

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,490
firebase questions always happy to help

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:22,200
it's a quick question who has used

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:24,270
firebase in react native it'll go the

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,780
pressure

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,149
so those of you haven't

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,080
what is firebase and for those that you

00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:37,380
have sorry about this so their tagline

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,350
for firebase is firebase helps build

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,369
mobile and web by which helps mobile and

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:48,299
web app teams succeed and to do this 5h

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:51,299
provides three PC Suites of products so

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,270
firstly building better apps through

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,649
their hosted solutions such as database

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,429
storage authentication secondly

00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:01,110
improving the quality of your app

00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:05,119
through their products such as

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,100
crashlytics performance monitoring and

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,940
finally helping you grow your business

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,640
and engaging with your users through

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,269
products such as in that messaging a be

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:23,700
testing remote config and probably ball

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:26,400
had a cloud messaging FCM from a

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,340
developer perspective firebase provides

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,680
many alder box solutions for a lot of

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,260
their challenges and complex tasks we

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,280
have to do as developers when developing

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,070
products and tools and apps and but it

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,760
does so through a very little code or

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,739
complexity in your app and one of the

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,870
cool things is we're able to to ship

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,510
cloud functions in seconds connect them

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,310
directly to connect to them directly

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,769
from our apps or set up scalable

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,930
triggers which executes when certain

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,329
events occur events such as data

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,299
changing and your database when a new

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:09,690
new users created or a new crash report

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:11,880
was received by base is free to get

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,160
started and comes with some very

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,069
generous free plans and also many of the

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,870
services such as authentication

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:22,200
crashlytics and remote config or

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,540
completely free to use and pretty much

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,540
all almost require zero configuration to

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,810
get started and obviously I could go on

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,150
all evening about all of those but I

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,800
won't

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:39,690
because I'm here to talk about react

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,569
native specifically so this brings me on

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,959
to native firebase

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:48,030
so as I mentioned earlier invitees means

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,100
maintains and develops react native

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,780
firebase so what is react needs fire

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,160
base for those who haven't used it

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,830
it's an SDK which wraps around the

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,670
official fibrocystic case for Android in

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:11,370
Java

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:13,230
and iOS in objective-c so we worked hard

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,810
to ensure where possible that we

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,549
followed the same API implementation as

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,290
the web SDK so that users coming from

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,290
the web don't obviously have to learn

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:25,500
new API and this also helps for greater

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,600
code reusability when you're building a

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,980
web app and also react native app side

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,760
by side and these don't really match up

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,840
to what I'm talking about

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:40,790
I fixed that bit so the library's first

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,380
created in 2016 because we needed a

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,470
companion app to a web app we were

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,120
building on top of firebase and from

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:52,050
there we've heavily invested into react

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:55,070
native and also using firebase just

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,540
because they work really well together

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,540
at the time when we started existing

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,630
libraries connecting to react native

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,919
firebase very poorly documented and kind

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:09,030
of lacked many of the key features and

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:12,750
services so today our implementation

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:16,500
consists of 19 react native modules over

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,960
1400 tests which require two dedicated

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Mac minis otherwise we're going to be

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,870
waiting forever and also is own

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,860
documentation website with hundreds of

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,860
pages of documentation

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:35,980
so to help demonstrate some of the ways

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,110
of firebase can kind of simplify

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,150
building your products I've put together

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,790
an app which we'll go through and just

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,010
kind of demo some of the services or

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:49,410
we'll start off with cloud fire stored

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,410
and if anyone's used our fire store

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,030
basically cloud via store is a no sequel

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,340
database with live synchronization

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,320
across all the clients so it could be

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,570
your website your app they're all kept

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,980
in sync and it also has offline support

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,050
and it also integrates as well with all

00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,000
the other firebase products and you can

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,310
also do things like have function

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,430
triggers when a new record is added to

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,160
collection when a record is modified and

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:23,800
it's just obviously scales up infinitely

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:31,270
and so on the screen here I've got a

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:32,560
basic an app I'm not a UI person so if

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:37,650
it doesn't look pretty I'm sorry

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:41,200
uh-huh so fire fire still comes with

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:43,330
fairly flexible queering and ordering

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,760
and you know standard stuff you'd expect

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:50,530
from a database kind of spoil that one

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:56,250
yeah so you can do things like sorting

00:06:50,530 --> 00:07:00,060
so sorting by the air in this case and

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:06,420
ordering by the most popular so

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,420
Godfather she goes it's hard except that

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,370
it can also do kind of range queries so

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:18,080
filtering where the movies are greater

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:20,390
than you know yeah mm you could do

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,580
things like limiting you know all the

00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,590
standard stuff and then recently they've

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,290
introduced kind of inquiring which it

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:30,380
expect from a database so I can even do

00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:35,750
things like specifically selecting where

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:39,170
the title is in this array and then kind

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:42,350
of okay I want to select all fantasy or

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:46,040
adventure movies I can do that as well

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:51,610
pretty flexible in terms of the

00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,610
dashboard so if I go to you

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:02,170
so you can this is the firebase console

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:08,800
and you can browse all your data here in

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:11,500
the console so if we kind of change so

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,430
what did we have on screen inception so

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:22,600
we find that it was that one wasn't it

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:24,280
that's a lot of the Rings should know

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,780
these off by heart by now so yeah if we

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:33,010
just change the score on this one

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:36,820
I don't know 66 should go back and you

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,620
can see it's updated in real time so

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,650
yeah that's pretty much it for cloud

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,190
firestore there's obviously a lot of

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:47,500
query stuff you can do and in terms of

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,420
kind of security and kind of securing

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,810
your data they have a powerful rule

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,910
system where you can basically create

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,130
rules to limit how users access your

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,110
data and you can do very advanced things

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,540
like kind of are you the users in this

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,060
group of collection documents okay they

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,360
can access these documents that kind of

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,640
thing

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:12,390
I won't go into too much detail about

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:15,400
that the next one I want to look at is

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:20,770
authentication with my super secret

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:24,280
password and so yeah so authentication

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,660
basically is quick easy setup for many

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,380
of the common flows that you do in

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:36,190
authentication so or through like Google

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:41,350
Twitter github Apple soon I can show you

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:47,740
currently all the supported providers so

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:50,400
in this example I've set it up Google so

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,400
like a sign-in with Google

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:11,120
and my amazing profile screen we are

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:14,120
signed in so yes that's kind of Roth

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,950
really I can then go to the cotton there

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,920
console I can disable accounts reset

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:23,000
passwords delete this account because I

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,850
don't like you and then you have your

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,330
standards okay I want to create an exist

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,840
I want to create an account so just

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:38,210
created username password and I can now

00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:42,590
sign in with that and then I can also do

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:49,520
things like I mentioned before very

00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:54,530
fresh disable the account if I try and

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,300
sign in again it's all disabled in terms

00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,690
of the code for that it's again you can

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,150
do pretty standard stuff and you can

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,460
basically create a authentication state

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,550
listener and then you can populate your

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,520
component States through that which kind

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:15,920
of plays quite well with the way react

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,450
is as you can see the codes yeah so

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,010
there you go so when the off state

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:25,880
changes gives me a user and then I get

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,750
the current user I said it just ate and

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,460
then obviously because the state's

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,330
updated my componentry renders yeah and

00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,370
all the other methods are pretty

00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,740
straightforward sign-in great user name

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:42,320
email password they do is what you

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:45,680
expect the next one I can look at is

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,540
cloud storage so I've built this also

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:53,920
amazing image uploader and so what this

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,780
does absolute cloud storage

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,820
it's basically backed by Google cloud

00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,880
platform storage and allows you to

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,450
upload or download user files such as

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,840
images audio video and again just like

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:11,000
fire store you could do kind of advanced

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,850
security rules to restrict data to

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,410
certain users or however you see fit to

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,990
structure your data

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:20,060
it's kind of like a standard folder on

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:24,380
your desktop you can do folders nest

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,870
folders add as many items as you want so

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:32,840
what we'll do we'll add a quick photo

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:37,870
that's one there we go

00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:47,980
so we go back to heat here and refresh I

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:47,980
should have a 30 now appropriately names

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,140
there you go

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,700
and yeah so you can do all sorts of

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,430
things as well the photo you can kind of

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:59,150
set metadata that you can read you can

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,130
also list items and the buckets in terms

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:06,050
of the code for that again it's pretty

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:08,990
straightforward so you create a task to

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,300
upload a file so put file and you can

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:15,410
say I I've added some custom metadata

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:20,380
but not by me if you look at the

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,380
metadata you can see there it's visible

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,890
yes and I created a task and then for

00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,350
the task I subscribe to state changed

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:34,630
and then I can listen to the upload

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,980
state display fancy UI uploading a file

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,180
it can batch as many of these as you

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:44,960
want together because these all go to

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:48,610
native yeah that's storage feel like I'm

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,610
kind of just going through one of them

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,560
crashlytics don't have anyone whose use

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,690
prattle it explore is kind of formerly

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,530
owned by Twitter and then firebase

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:04,630
recently acquired it about a year ago

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:07,970
and then kind of since then you can do

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,920
basically capture your crash reports and

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,490
react native which includes JavaScript

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,160
stack traces native crashes like object

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,110
to C Java and kind of even the MDK

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,900
crashes from the native development kit

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:24,020
on Android which is useful especially

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,040
for react native because of the yoga

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,790
layout engine that we are native users

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,209
is powered in decay so all those kind of

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,279
stack traces are picked up and you can

00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:38,730
do things like okay I want to log this

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,889
to go with any crashes I also want to

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,639
set some attributes for the crash report

00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:48,209
so when it crashes these are available

00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:51,569
and I can attach user information so if

00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:53,339
I want to use a report as an issue I can

00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:55,470
go okay what's your user name from I

00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,130
have a screen and I can go to the

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,139
dashboard and filter by that user

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,420
there's also a little handy method to

00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:13,290
crash your app which I don't know I

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:14,880
guess well that does yeah so so you get

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,069
your native ones as you would if you're

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,920
using Android iOS and then on top of

00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:22,709
that we submit a JavaScript one for

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,959
unhandled exceptions and unhandled

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:26,100
promise rejections so we automatically

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,899
listen to those in the react native

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,639
environment and then we submit that to

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:37,050
crashlytics so yes I've just crashed my

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:43,019
app and if I go to the crashlytics

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:49,610
console in theory I should be able to

00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:51,779
see any crash so there's a crash

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,170
obviously the stack trace is from the

00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,459
native method that says I want to crash

00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:00,540
so obviously in this case not very

00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:02,399
helpful but for the purposes of this

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,510
demo you can see he has the extra data

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,850
that we've added any additional logs and

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:11,040
it also kind of ties in with your

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,360
analytics event so you can see obviously

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,980
you set that up correctly you'll know

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,470
okay they've gone to this screen that

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,910
screen and then it's crashed and kind of

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,639
just tools to aid you in reproducing and

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:28,250
there's obviously all sorts of kind of

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,250
device information that kind of thing

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:36,310
so kind of my favorite on to demo my

00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:39,040
guess is in that message in app

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,840
messaging it's basically part of the

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,750
growing your business kind of suite of

00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,240
products that firebase offer kind of

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,600
allows you to send targeted custom

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,950
design kind of branded branded messages

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,350
to your user kind of based on their

00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,880
behavior and interests so I'll give you

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,060
an example because that probably doesn't

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,770
explain what it does so for local

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,730
testing they give you an instance ID

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:14,490
that you can go to the console and then

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:19,890
test so I've set up a draft campaign and

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:25,209
I'll just edit this one very cheesy joke

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:28,060
and I'll add my instance ID which still

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,580
they're on the same so I'll send that

00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,850
off and then I'll explain it so what you

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,560
can do you can create little cards

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,860
modal's kind of little banners that

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:42,400
appear when your app opens the next time

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:45,850
without doing any UI code so you can

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:50,250
customize message title body kind of an

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:54,010
image buttons like if I had a button I

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,860
can then say okay this button does this

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,960
opens this URL and then with euros you

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,440
can obviously use firebase deep links so

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:06,330
you can deep link back into your app and

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,330
so I've sent that test one-off and

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:13,320
theory if I reopen the out

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:29,440
does it remember the shortcut to get a

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:37,330
home Thank You Hasan not an IRS dev

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:43,300
there you go and then finally the one

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:44,350
I'm gonna cover remote config so remote

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,060
company basically allows you to

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:52,510
customize your apps behavior remotely so

00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:54,220
kind of one thing to imagine that I'm

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,340
doing is maybe you implement a new

00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,640
feature like okay I want a dark mode on

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,900
my app see basically implements all but

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,330
you don't really want to release it just

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,120
yet and you want a kind of a view test

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:10,570
it so you implement it all you upload

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,250
your bundle to say code push it to its

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,830
load but the feature is disabled by

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:20,260
default and then you kind of hook that

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:25,900
up to remote config through the

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:29,890
dashboard and I've created a dark mood

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:33,490
flag and I've said okay it's off at the

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:35,410
moment and what I can do in this demo

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,330
you can see I've got no additional new

00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,150
features it's not really a great way of

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:48,960
showcasing this but just for this demo

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:48,960
so I set this to true publish my changes

00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:03,860
and go back to my ash the next time I

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:07,249
load this I have now enabled to feature

00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:09,210
remotely with no code changes in the app

00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,309
so you can do all sorts of things with

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,690
that

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:16,440
some of the things I like doing for is a

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:19,320
be testing so you build a new feature

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,200
like I said before you can test it on a

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,330
certain set of users so you can do

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,580
various conditions and so the one I just

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,480
used it's just a default one just said

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,090
okay enable it for all iOS users

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,129
obviously can do it more advanced ones

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:37,200
like that basically it can even hook it

00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:44,009
up to analytics and user properties on

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:49,879
your analytics and I think that's pretty

00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:52,169
much all I was going to cover yeah I

00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:55,230
won't go into any more this is obviously

00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:58,619
like another ten of them but if anyone's

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,600
got any questions yeah so you're asking

00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:01,710
the image uploader did I use a library

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,860
for that

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,960
no I didn't I used the camera roll just

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:11,960
to retrieve the items on the device and

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:16,769
then just bra firebase cloud storage to

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:21,419
basically give it a file path here just

00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:24,480
put file the URI the UI is the file that

00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:26,940
has come from camera I've selected that

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,940
past the year I'd say cloud storage

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,419
corporate file that crates and upload

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,580
their own native code and it uploads in

00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,730
terms of the little progress bar again

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,679
that was just me doing set transferred

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,299
which is a state and I just round the

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,919
number of bytes transferred to create

00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,919
there a little progress bar

00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:53,909
yes so I'll put a link up on my last

00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:57,119
sighs there's a soul life and sauce here

00:21:53,909 --> 00:22:01,169
when you have the latest in a normal

00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,729
application when you do normally crash

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:05,339
your application

00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:13,169
intentionally jeez like try and catch

00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:14,820
bugs tonight call the methods No so so

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:16,109
the way I've set it up on the

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,869
implementation for react negative

00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:21,659
firebase is in react native you can set

00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:23,190
a global error catch and so I've set

00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,559
that up to automatically hook into that

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,479
and then when a global error that you've

00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,209
not handled it'll go through there

00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:32,159
automatically whereas manually as well

00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:34,950
if you've tried catch somewhere and you

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:40,469
want to record a manual error you can do

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:45,119
crashlytics dart record error and give

00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:47,309
it a new error instance and then that

00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:55,919
will report the full stack trace to the

00:22:47,309 --> 00:23:05,789
concept so you're doing v-sit I knew

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:07,229
this was gonna come right say I don't

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:11,369
want I don't want to share the link too

00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:12,869
soon but soon as you can imagine there's

00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:14,999
a lot of work to build a notifications

00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:18,809
library because Android has about 50

00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:24,089
different features I'm gonna share it

00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:26,659
and Elliott it's gonna kill me so yeah

00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:30,349
we're working on it this is it

00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:33,570
obviously it's dev please don't lose it

00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:35,879
but yeah so on the main issue that's

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,219
pinned army I mean firebase there is a

00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:43,169
form that you can fill in to get early

00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:45,149
access it's local notifications for iOS

00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:48,479
and Android but it does every every

00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:49,340
feature so it's kind of place all the

00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:53,450
content at the moment

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:55,100
but it's kind of does media style inbox

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,460
style the kind of a notification styles

00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:01,129
in Android it does background task

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,830
messaging scheduling and then for iOS

00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:07,460
does all the same the group's actions

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:10,549
and for iOS 13 it will support

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,429
background tasks as well and there's

00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:15,429
obviously a lot more than that bit I

00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:27,169
can't remember all of them are fine

00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:36,559
so obviously that all the time yep how

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:39,679
do you keep so no no it's all manual in

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,379
terms of keeping up so where would kind

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,480
of say good mates with Google firebase

00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:48,769
team and so they kind of give us heads

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,999
up on kind of new features and we just

00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:51,889
kind of work on them privately in the

00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:53,269
background so like last year when

00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:54,919
firestore was announced you would have

00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:56,779
noticed the same day it was announced we

00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:00,700
really support but we'd been working

00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:00,700
