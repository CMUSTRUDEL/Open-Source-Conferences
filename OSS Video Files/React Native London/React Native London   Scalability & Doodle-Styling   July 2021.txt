lots of fun and enjoyment to the ui

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:39,840
and how you can give real character to

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:39,840
what you're building

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:47,449
[Music]

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,230
[Music]

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,600

present you

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,560
a few tricks to give your app some

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
character

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,120
using doodle style decorators such as

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
this one this is my very first time

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,479
presenting

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,479
in a meetup so i hope you're you'll

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,120
enjoy my presentation uh

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,360
before beginning let me introduce myself

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,880
my name is arthur i live in montpellier

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,919
in the south of france i've been working

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,880
on many different projects when i was a

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
freelance developer

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,919
mostly web applications and especially

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,160
react web applications

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,639
i'm quite a beginner regarding react

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,520
native applications

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,720
and today i worked as a software

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,840
engineer at sunday

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,400
what is sunday sunday

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,000
the goal of sunday is to save time for

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,880
what matters

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,080
this means that when you're in in when

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
you are in a restaurant

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,160
having a meaningful time with your

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
friends your family

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,800
by being able to pay your bill in 10

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,800
seconds instead of 10 minutes

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
sunday save you meaningful time for what

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,440
matters

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,479
and to do so we want to build a great

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,599
user experience

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,400
with a remarkable user interface and

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,880
that's the point

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
of all the doodle we have on our

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,720
interface

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,880
as you can see for example on this one

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,240
with a tip to show your support with the

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,120
line through support

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,479
the little hurt to decorate the world

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,120
and the love to replace

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:41,759
the support that being said

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,759
when i've just got the mock-up of the ui

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
my first reaction has been

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,840
what the hell it's going to be a

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,919
nightmare to implement this

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,520
but actually i had a lot of fun

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,240
implementing these doodles

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,199
handling a text translation the

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,400
different size

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,560
of texts

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,240
so it was very fun so i wanted to share

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,520
with you all the fun i got

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,599
so we are going to left-cut the

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,599
implementation of this particular one

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,199
all right so let's start we are going to

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:18,160
start uh

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,800
with uh with this application

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
um so we have a very simple application

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,120
with just

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,560
an image displayed and a text container

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
containing a

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,759
translated text so the information is

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,240
already

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,000
handled so that number is a point of the

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,640
presentation so we can translate it in

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
english

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
or in french

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,560
so we are going to start uh

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,959
replacing uh the word support

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,160
in our translate in our translated

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,839
string

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,920
uh by uh react components

00:08:51,839 --> 00:09:00,160
so to do so i'll just replace

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,160
the component i already prepared

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,200
we change the id of the string we want

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,519
to translate

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,839
so let's see the translated strings

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,560
so we are starting with a simple string

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
translation

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,399
with a tip to show your support uh as a

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,440
string

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,480
and we we are replacing it

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,720
with a

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
with support replaced by a variable

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,640
[Music]

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:35,279
and to replace the word support

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,279
we are not replacing it with another

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,240
word we are replacing

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,279
we are replacing it with a component

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,760
with the translated word support

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,760
the result is an error

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:56,240
the result is another error because

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
i did a little mistake

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
all right the result simply has this so

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,800
we are going to

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,079
go deep into the love doodle component

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,360
so as we can see uh

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,120
so what what the lovejoust component do

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,279
it's a quite simple component with a

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,480
view encapsulated

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,279
two other components the first one is a

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,040
simple text component

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:28,240
to display to display the word support

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,560
and the second one is an

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,959
image an image background component that

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,880
is styled using a style components

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,079
library

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,079
and the important point is that

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,600
this component is positionated in

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,279
absolute

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,279
which has which let us

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,519
which enable us to display it uh on top

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,560
of the text

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,560
but as we can see it's not perfectly uh

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,920
displayed like the position is not quite

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,040
good because

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,079
uh we the position we we picked

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,120
is a tab 0 button 0 left 0 right 0

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,160
which is exactly the dimension of the

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,440
parent container

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,399
which is a dimension of the support word

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,120
so we want to adjust it a little bit so

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,120
i'll just add

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,480
20 pixels at the top and

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,399
in order to have the line through

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
to to go a little beyond

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,040
the limits of our text we just have some

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,480
negative values on the left and

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,480
on the right of the component

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:40,160
and the result is quite better

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,120
so we have the lines through precisely

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,160
our text

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,240
to play a bit with this component

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,600
we can see that it handles correctly

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,600
a bigger text

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,519
so this is thanks to the absolute

00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,519
position

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,240
and and this works also with the french

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,240
translation

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
all right the next step will be to add

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,519
the

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,040
heart decorator and the the word

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,720
love so it's pretty much the same thing

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,160
it's two other components that are

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,160
positionated in absolute

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,880
um so

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,839
let's start with the heart uh decorator

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
the heart component

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,079
so here it is it's exactly the same

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,200
thing i just show you

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,320
uh adding a background color

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,680
uh the exact position

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,639
of this component so as we can see it's

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600
an image

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,120
background container with a simple image

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,079
as a background

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
and it's positioned in absolute a little

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,399
uh on the right

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,480
from from our container so so it

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:05,279
it's displayed right after and uh

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,839
a little on the top so just to to to fit

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
the position

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,320
and the last thing uh is a

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,320
love text that is displayed

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,560
right under our text so it's also a

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,959
position

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,000
a position absolute oh it's not that

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,040
component

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,279
i love decorator this one so

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,360
it's a it's the same thing it's a

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,600
component position until in absolute

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,040
and a text component that is a little

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,800
bit transformed with the

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,839
rotation to give some dynamic

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,079
an absolute position a color and a font

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,600
size

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,199
and the other important thing is the

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
front family

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,199
so to to give your application some

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
character you need to have

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,120
like a regular font for all the text

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,560
because you can have a fancy font for

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
all your text because it's going to be a

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
nightmare for the user otherwise

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,360
so yeah i wanted to show you how we how

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,720
you can load

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,720
using a font export font

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:21,279
a custom custom typo

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,199
so we are using use fonts from expo font

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,480
and we simply load a ttf file

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,720
this one can be fine can be can be find

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,839
on

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
on google front for example

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
and the last point

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,279
i forgot to to remove

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,320
this particular thing

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,680
that if i remove this border so i'm

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,079
going to remove it so i can explain it

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,079
before

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,190
all right and let's see for example uh

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,519
as it is in french um

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,600
[Music]

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,040
the replaced word is not at the end of

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,480
the sentence as it was

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,480
in english so it's kind of ugly so to

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,079
avoid this uh

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,600
we simply add some border rights

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,600
on our support

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,480
our support

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:30,320
component so all the space we need

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,480
for the heart uh is

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,600
handled using the border white widths

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,680
and why do

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,759
we use a border right instead of a

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,839
padding right or imagine what

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,160
or margin right it's simply because

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,160
we position it we position our other

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,279
component in absolute

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,639
and if using the border the absolute

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,680
position will not change

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,880
inside the component if we use a padding

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,519
we will have to subtract this padding

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,800
in order to position our components so

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,800
that's more convenient this way

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:11,279
so to sum up what we what we've seen

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,480
during my presentation we've been using

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,199
react entl to

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,000
translate the message and we used a

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,519
component instead of text

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,240
to to make more fancy uh doodle

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,880
we also see how to load a custom font

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,279
using

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,079
uh expo font and we've seen

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,000
that using absolute position for our

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,759
component

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,320
can enable us to do a lot of very fancy

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,320
processing

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:51,839
thank you for listening and if you have

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,839
any questions

00:16:52,280 --> 00:17:04,080
[Music]

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,520
um so yeah thank you for that talk also

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,319
it was really cool to see how you've

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,199
uh from from that ui music experience to

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,079
life

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,679
um i had one question um but probably

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,439
quickly before we start if anyone does

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,679
have any questions please just um put

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,559
them in the chat on youtube and i will

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,840
ask them to the speakers as as you are

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,120
as you ask them to

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,160
us um so yeah the question i had was

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,240
does this work

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,440
as well in real native web as it does as

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
it reacts nato

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,919
that's a very good question actually

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,320
this has been built

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,320
at first using react web

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:54,160
and i build it with reg native

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,160
especially for you

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
so yeah it works pretty much the same

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,919
thing i use

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,720
the same library like

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,240
a style component for example and react

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,200
entl

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:15,520
intl there are small differences

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,559
i think some things are more convenient

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
on the web for example for text

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,919
components

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,559
that you you don't have to encapsulate

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,520
the text component in two views to

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,760
to to do such things so it's a little we

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,799
have you have a little less verbosity

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,120
uh doing this with direct web but both

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,120
works

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,320
um so i've got one question from from

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,720
from the chat here and i've been asked

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,640
why was image background used instead of

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,000
image

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,000
yeah a very good question too

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:58,480
what image background let us do

00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:01,520
it's to you you can set how the image

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,160
resize uh regarding uh

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
the size of the the component the actual

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,200
component

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,960
so we use a stretch resize mode

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,480
for the first line through

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,480
and i don't think you can do that with

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
the image component but i i can be wrong

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,440
maybe you can do the same with a

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,120
simple image component yeah

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
i think you can but may yeah maybe there

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,600
are other small tweaks especially with

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,919
the background

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,919
being the way it is um

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,000
um it was quite stressful

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,240
uh but it was fine it was fun and i hope

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,550
everyone enjoyed it seems like it went

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,840
well yeah it was good

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,280
[Music]

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,840
you could have some other quick tips for

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,960
us in the future

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,960
sure always pleasure

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,039
maybe uh it'd be a good format uh

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,760
lightning talks

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,960
yeah again if people would like to give

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,000
them

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,240
more than happy to host them um we'll

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,159
ask in the comments

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,960
yeah please do um so

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,840
yeah i suppose uh master or any other

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,840
questions gonna put in the chat

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,360
which doesn't seem

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,159
like that is um suppose

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,640
we shall move on to walk on talk um so

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,159
we'll

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,320
be talking about um how to speed up the

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,679
creation of your uis in that native

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:49,280
using

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:53,210
okay just pause that for a second guys

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,210
[Music]

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:11,600
[Music]

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:15,039
and you're good to start hello guys

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,760
thank you leo for this opportunity

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,520
and invites to talk on react native

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,000
london meetup

my name is hetman wilhelm johan and

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,120
um i will talk about today i'll talk

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,320
about speed up your react native as the

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,559
development 10 times faster pretty

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,120
impressive

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,760
um let's talk uh let let me introduce

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,720
myself

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,520
um as i said my name hetman wilhelm and

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,520
i have

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,919
more than 10 years full full stack

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,799
development experience coding with react

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,400
native from 2015

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:58,480
and working with small to enterprise

00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,679
clients also i'm a youtube creator

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,559
for react ui kit channel

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,960
and i specialized with mostly with react

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,480
and

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,400
react native typescript and basic ios

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,799
received and recording

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,080
as i said full stack i do have

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,370
experience with

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,520
backend uh backend

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:21,039
[Music]

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,240
technologies like php mostly laravel and

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,840
node.js

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,480
and everything related to devops linux

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,760
machines servers pipelines

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,760
we know all about it

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,280
so as i said today i will talk about uh

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,960
how to speed up

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,240
your your react native app development

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,480
10 times faster first of all

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,520
um what's the first step

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,559
to speed up the

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,080
development usually

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,200
uh from my experience each time i start

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,600
i started a project i use um use it used

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,760
me to take three days to set up

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,310
between one and three days to set up a

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,880
t-mobile app

00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,760
[Music]

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,120
so i will show you how to create a

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,120
t-mobile app using react context

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,760
why because it will um speed up

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,400
it will speed up the development

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,440
basically

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,559
updating one file

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,960
one file to um to support

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,000
uh t-mobile app like changing color

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,760
sizes text

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,919
fonts etc so here i have the soft ui

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,679
react native that i've developed or

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,159
developed um as you can see it's a

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,480
light mode in light mode in here on the

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,440
bottom here i have the dark mode

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,480
the switch if i'm clicking this

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,320
basically

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,200
the whole app is um is loading is

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,559
transformed into a dark mode dark mode

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,760
and whichever side

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:07,360
you can see let me show how i did this

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,360
let's use steam

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:15,039
i created a custom custom hook use steam

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,919
it's called um it's custom made i mean

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,080
everything here in the app is done from

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,279
scratch

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,520
i've created a text team context which

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,960
receives the theme by default the light

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,480
mode and

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,960
method to set the team and the provider

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,320
which

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,400
except the children the team also

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,919
and the set set team provider here

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,559
and this part here basically uh is the

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,080
hook which is connected to the context

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,520
using the theme content

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,200
that in the theme reacts use contextual

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,240
so in 26 lines of code

00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,080
i've basically done the t-mobile part

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,080
but the most important one is the the

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,760
team

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,960
so here i open the light

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:13,279
theme which is basically

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,799
um a file with a lot of consoles

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,279
for colors gradients sizes spacing

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,840
and the same here i do have a common

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,600
theme

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,720
that basically what does

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,919
what does it do it's provide us with

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,120
assets icons for example a lot of our

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,559
files here

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:38,240
icons fonts

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:41,679
weights font weight and so on

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,799
back to the light why is

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,360
so important are you asking why does

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,559
this

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,760
is so important um

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:55,039
basically the theme how i use it

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,600
for example in the home home screen

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,159
i'm using i'm using it like this to

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,360
access

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:05,440
everything that i need in that light

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,480
lighting or lights theme or dark thing

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,520
from the assets which is basically

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,559
all the assets the colors and etc

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,279
for example this one this component

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,200
receiver

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:22,400
has a property that says the color card

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,080
or the text or is it text here

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,200
by default the text has this color

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:34,159
and let's switch to light mode

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:37,520
and if we change it to maybe red

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,799
basically the app every text that

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,400
doesn't have a color um

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,159
a color property to change it

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,760
individually receives this

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,320
uh this this text here so uh this color

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,360
sorry

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,880
so if i change it to the dark mode

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:58,159
switch to the dartmouth dartmouth

00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,440
has the white white color so

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,799
um why why are you thinking why

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,919
why does this um sorry

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:11,039
reverb this why does this this is

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,520
is this important it does support it

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,799
adds support for white labeling so

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,960
basically creating

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,559
multiple apps with different colors

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,679
different themes

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,159
uh like doing uh an app

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,520
and then after a couple of months we

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,080
need the companies

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,120
the startup is rebranding you we need to

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,240
change everything

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,600
we just use basically this constants

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,200
here to

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,720
change all the colors or the sizes or

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,919
the fonts whatever we need the

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,440
components

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,640
in a matter of minutes um

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,919
just from one single file

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,480
um also for us developers this will

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,760
reduce the time for uh for the updates

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,320
and also for the

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,080
feedback received from maybe from the qa

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,640
team or from the business

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:06,080
with this business management um

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,520
yeah that's the this part one of

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,159
many parts for this development is speed

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,840
up

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:17,679
development so another

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,279
aspect on this is in one to speed up the

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,919
development is structuring structuring

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,840
the app how to structure the react

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,320
native apps to be scalable

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:34,399
for example from small small um

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,640
smallest apps like a startup like a map

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,679
a simple map or simple app to an

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,520
enterprise level where we have like

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:48,399
more than um under 100 screens

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:51,600
per app or or components and so on

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:55,120
um from my perspective this is

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,320
basically a complex from the

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,440
scaling part how to scale your app in a

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,360
way that

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,480
basically supports unlimited screens or

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,000
components

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,360
how i do how i done this is using

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
a naming convention mostly

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,279
combined from mobile to web like

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,240
creating a source

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,000
everything in the source uh folder we

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,440
include like the assets

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
fonts icons images here we have the open

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,360
sounds

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,919
uh custom font and then we have the um

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,440
icons all the icons on the app the

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,399
notification basket

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,240
search etc etc and then we have the

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,440
images like this part here

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,240
images here usually i've used them for

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,600
um

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,559
for the mocking purpose

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,520
and um showing showing showcasing the

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,399
app

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,760
but you we can add default images

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,640
avatars on

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,840
so next one will be the components the

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,279
components are the

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,840
core um core part of the app basically

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,279
we are

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,159
using every using components in a way

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,080
that

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:11,360
we write code and speed up

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,039
everything um they develop in the

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,520
development process

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,360
and the next part is the constant as you

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,559
can as you saw in on

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,520
previous um this slide

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,159
we have the the themes here the dark the

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,000
light

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,960
the rejects uh have some rules here for

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,679
the regex

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,720
and then the common theme uh

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,799
translations

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,399
i will talk about later about

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,320
translations and then they

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,799
types the typescript types for the

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,240
components themes etc

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:47,679
um important ones are the hooks

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,840
custom hooks use team presented um

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,720
use data use data is mostly used for

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,200
mocking everything here but it's it can

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,880
be

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,320
pretty much um pretty much updated

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,320
to add whatever you we want

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:11,919
like um api data

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:14,960
firebase whatever data we have

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,080
we have in our back end and then the

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,039
navigation part

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,399
i'm using react navigation for this i

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,519
have like

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,880
a couple of screens here

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:29,919
for this and then stacking

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,120
doing a stack for navigator

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,840
for each screen and then in the

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,039
menu part is the drawable menu this is

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,200
the drawable menu

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,880
basically we have an animation here

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,440
that's what it does

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
is uh scaling these screens here the

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,320
stacks

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,440
the stack screens and then the screens

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,880
here the screens basically we have

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,480
everything from this from about from

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,600
home extras whatever all the

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:06,799
all the screens that the ui

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:10,480
design has has provided me

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:14,000
um yeah so um i was thinking

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:17,360
how what else is um

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,799
is uh to be scaled on because we already

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,760
have the structure

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,200
and we can create simple to complex apps

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,120
using this structure

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,519
pretty much easy to okay screens or

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,240
everything in the screens can be found

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,200
easily

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,159
and maybe the components a block or the

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,399
text

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:41,039
pretty much super easy to find and then

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,480
an important thing here and i will

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,679
discuss later on

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,399
is um a cast a custom yeah custom

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,919
property

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:53,679
name id the id here um

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,399
is basically generating um the component

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,840
test id or accessibility id based on the

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,559
platform for example for

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,200
um android you have the accessibility id

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,480
and for ios we have the test id

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
what is this about for what what why we

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,080
should

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,640
implement this basically add supports to

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,799
the

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,480
qa team the testing team to create

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,840
automating testing

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,120
um using for example appium software

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,080
in this way um the qa

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,200
which kind of is our friend and also our

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,399
enemy

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,559
from because why why

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,760
why we they are funding bugs that we

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,279
don't but

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,960
yeah it's they are also uh ensuring that

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,320
the quality that

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,519
our for our work is maintained

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,200
to a higher level um the qa

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:51,279
team um doing this

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,399
will provide us with support for

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,880
uh automated testing unit testing and so

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,600
on

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,640
but i will talk about uh the components

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,080
later on

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:07,840
but um yeah

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:12,240
okay so switching back

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,200
next um next uh as the title said of my

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,879
talk the title

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:20,560
um how to code 10 times faster

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,599
but um with what basically

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,919
with uh reusable components and

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,879
also functional um why

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,520
reusable components reusable components

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,679
help us

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,240
developer developers to write less code

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,040
it's pretty much easy to write a lot of

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,520
code

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,079
and over complicated everything in the

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,599
project

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,599
and when

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,000
remember that uh each time i needed to

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,040
ramp up

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,679
other team members in the uh on a

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,320
project

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,720
i needed to explain everything every

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,240
piece of code that i've done and i

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,599
noticed that this can take a long

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:09,119
time and also for me

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,520
kind of hard to explain why i did that

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,119
and that

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,480
and that but writing less code

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,839
is also pretty complicated because

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,119
abstraction of the code let's say

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,560
input let's say this component

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,680
the input component can be can

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,280
can lead to couple

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,680
like this a couple of it's not

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,280
over complicated but it's a complex app

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,440
that can be reused

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,359
pretty much okay so think about the

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,720
input is basically

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:47,920
it should have been this one but on the

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,040
let me see the components here i'm doing

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,640
like this

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,760
search as you can see it has

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,280
uh it has like a lot of things here

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:03,280
on focus on success etc let me

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,400
show let me show the create account

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,320
so let me see if i'm doing like this

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,079
i'm writing something like this minimum

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,599
characters demo

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,720
or level yeah levels accept it

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,160
and so clear level

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,200
okay uh

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,400
i am oh we have auto complete i'm not

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,599
level

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,200
uh okay so next one we have like

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:35,599
uh the input here the password which is

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,720
let's see uh level password

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,000
dot one two three doesn't work

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,880
invalid password yeah i will ask you all

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,400
later on

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,280
for for his password kidding

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,400
um okay so as you can see here we have

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,400
this part here

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,680
uh and on type the input uh basically

00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,079
will show if it's valid or invalid

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,200
and then if we are doing like this then

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,200
it's valid

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:08,079
so um a complex component that can

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,040
be reused pretty much let me show you

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,860
login

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,440
and login like where is it

00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:18,400
[Music]

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,680
here like this a couple of lines like 10

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,440
2 3 4 10 10 lines of code

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,400
i have a custom input that does a lot of

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,520
things

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,640
on success on danger

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,839
validation label etc if i'm changing

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,839
this one

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,960
basically where is it

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:44,079
yeah email

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,960
no it doesn't refresh i am ah because

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,960
i'm on register

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,160
okay all right

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,240
uh okay i'm doing the like this image

00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,320
here

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:04,160
then refreshing yep

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,119
so you can add labels custom laser etc

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,839
so um less code means less time to

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,880
develop

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:14,000
and easy to maintain if i need to add

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,599
extra icons maybe

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,480
other maybe info

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,599
for or warning for this component then i

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,800
can add it here

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,240
like a custom image

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,320
and also we can create

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,280
we can enhance this component this

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,480
component to another component

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,680
like maybe doing let's see we

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,000
check checkbox the checkbox it pretty

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,920
much

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,400
check the checkbox and doesn't have

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,440
label but we can also for example the

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,560
this one can we can add the component to

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,119
the right side

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,040
in order to create one component that

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,400
receives the property and generates

00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,480
uh um component for this one

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:04,000
so um in this way

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,280
writing code for example the login part

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,880
the login screen

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,520
has like 200 some 229

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,880
lines of code as you can see i didn't

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,920
choose style

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,720
style component here sorry style

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,520
style sheet from react native everything

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,640
is done in

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:28,079
uh in in inline but using the style

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,760
stylesheet flat flatten method

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,160
in order to use to use this to add it

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,720
here

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:39,760
inline the performance pretty much uh

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,040
good as you can see this app it's

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,400
not called it's it's not a small app but

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,440
not a big complex app um

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,280
it's quite uh quite okay on

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,320
for his side the size and i'm using

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,599
for for um performance using

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,520
react memo because the component

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,160
receives a lot of properties and can be

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,839
changed

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,839
as you can see this one the demo

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:13,760
and maybe yeah

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,880
receives the properties here the danger

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,480
the the danger no yeah the danger color

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,040
or maybe the success

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,920
and each time it will render this this

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,640
one

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:30,400
um okay that's the important thing here

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,960
okay that's the how to how to speed up

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,160
this one

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,240
from experience um i'm

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,240
pretty sure it helped me a lot

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,240
another thing another thing that i've

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:50,400
i will show you right now is the

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,400
how to how to add um

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,040
how to add something that can be

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,960
pretty much important um i

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,920
do have a question do you know the

00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,680
worldwide's biggest

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,240
problem um

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,520
basically we don't speak the same

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,319
language

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,319
so for that i will show you how i fix it

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,280
let me show you

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,680
i implemented i created and implemented

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,800
a translation library for the f

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,920
to speak uh to use one app

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,079
for everyone that that speaks

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,440
differently a different language

00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,560
so for that i created uh your structural

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,000
translation fork what does this do

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:46,160
so it's pretty much uh similar to

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,839
used theme hook uh a context a provider

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,040
that receives

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:54,400
that use that is using the library the

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,680
e11 and translation library

00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,880
and it loads

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,640
uh translation files like

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:08,160
um in json files for example

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:11,280
here i have english and french

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,359
artul will be happy to

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,800
to see that i have a french translation

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:20,400
for this one um

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,800
for example no sorry yeah english first

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,560
uh i have an option in the settings

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,760
settings screen here

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,599
language english or french let's see

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:35,280
if i'm switching this so in

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:39,200
in one touch click i've changed the app

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,920
basically translated the app instantly

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,760
and like everything the components the

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,520
profiles

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:51,200
even the home research

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:55,040
this one tenants

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:59,040
articles notifications everything

00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,480
in one in one click how i did this

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,520
is pretty simple using a

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,440
local state inside the hook and

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,640
uh with the magic of e11

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,839
and translation library i've

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,240
set up something like local localem for

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,440
uh for the app and then the translation

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,760
files from here

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,720
english french even you can add

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,839
unlimited file

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,720
unlimited translations on this one uh

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,640
but

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,480
from my experience i've translated this

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,560
one uh it took me

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,520
quite a while to translate into french

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,560
and also

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,040
in the same time to basically uh

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,599
the translation from english to french

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,720
doesn't

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,760
didn't fit in the button or in the

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,079
in the text in the cards or and i needed

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,200
to find an alternative for that

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:54,800
so uh let me show you how i did this

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:59,280
for example uh soft ui

00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:03,200
soft ui maybe leo ui

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,079
there we are where is it

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,319
this one is in english so if you if you

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:12,160
translate this one in

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:15,200
english so leo you are react native

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,640
pretty much it's done

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,640
leo i have an app for you

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:27,680
and next one um let me see

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:31,280
um also you can change for example this

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,079
part here is for the uh for the manual

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,960
and let me show you how the french looks

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,960
like

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,040
identically we have the keys here

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,400
the keys here they have details for

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,400
example the

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,040
about or visit and then

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,240
you need only to translate this one you

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,119
can host this one

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,760
these files json files whenever wherever

00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,200
you

00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,560
uh you want uh

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,040
it's i think they have like a couple of

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,000
kilobytes one two three kilobytes

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,599
it doesn't uh doesn't affect the ad

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,760
performance on this one

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:14,400
but yeah um and how i use it

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,359
let me show you on the home pretty

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,160
quickly

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,760
so importing the hook and i have the t

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,000
function

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,359
they also have the translate the

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,440
translate function but t

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,480
is the short version for translate

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,680
function

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:33,200
and how you use it t

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,920
t common search for example okay so we

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,599
know that

00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,800
on uh on command object

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:44,400
we have the this key search and if we

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,400
are going to the english

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,800
command search

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:55,920
search here search find we're doing find

00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,240
ctc find exchange or

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:03,200
search something

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,319
pretty much simple something also these

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,520
translations

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,960
um let me show you this our support

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,200
thing

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,200
uh what is it this one

00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,119
there's this one this link

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,000
this one is it

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,560
um what i mean is uh

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,760
supporting post it on and a date let me

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:36,160
find quick quickly

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,160
come on come on

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,200
so in articles okay so in articles

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,200
we have

00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,319
[Music]

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:58,240
in articles here

00:46:54,319 --> 00:47:02,800
i've it on newest

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,800
yeah post it on january so

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:09,440
here the post it receives this object

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,000
date and a value and if we need to

00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,640
change this

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,640
one to maybe uh date and month

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:22,400
and we can see i know

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,400
maybe month like this no

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,480
month like this something like this

00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,839
pretty much

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:34,240
easy to update in a matter of seconds

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:37,040
the date on this one why the translation

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,760
this feature the translation part is is

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,720
important

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,359
basically add support to multi-language

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,800
apps

00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:48,319
and for startups um it provides

00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,200
a way to go to international markets and

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,000
from my knowledge market penetration is

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,400
a business

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,280
business growth strategy leading to more

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,960
sales

00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:03,040
so i didn't try that but

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,920
i think we know you know all about it

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,559
maybe for example no for stop startup

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,640
but for

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,760
uh for big um big companies like amazon

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,800
they have like an app

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,680
to on on every

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,000
every continent every language but yeah

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:23,359
and that's

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,040
that's what i have for today

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:29,839
thank you very much and don't forget

00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,520
let me see try the the free version of

00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,040
the soft ui

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,079
on creativecreativeteam.com

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:42,000
and also thank you

00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:46,839
again and i'm waiting for the questions

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,079
and you can visit me on my youtube

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:52,000
channel

00:48:48,079 --> 00:49:03,839
on react uikit.com

00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:03,839
thank you

00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:11,260
[Music]

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,880
um so yeah thank you um that was that

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,160
was really cool um

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,000
see how you went through and improved

00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,520
the speed of development and really

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,079
brought more value to your users as

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,119
quickly as possible um

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,280
from a slightly cody perspective um

00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,040
i noticed that you in your component

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,599
structure you didn't go for like atomic

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,040
design

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,680
was that like a particular choice you

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,680
made for ease of finding stuff or

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,920
um did i heard correctly

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,359
i didn't choose the atomic design yeah i

00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,200
didn't

00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:54,640
it's it's a similar concept

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,839
it's not so the atoms are pretty

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,839
pretty small and we need a lot of them

00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:04,000
to create something bigger

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:06,880
so uh i kind of combined them to

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,960
a molecule level like molecules you need

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,680
uh don't need a lot of them to create

00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,359
something

00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:17,920
but um for example um

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:20,720
as i showed you the input is combine is

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,839
using like one two three three

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,160
components

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,599
to create that custom input with

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,880
validation

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:32,400
label labeling

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,559
and the views that stick together

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
to create the layout for that custom

00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,359
input

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,079
it's pretty similar yeah as i say it's

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,359
funny

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,319
it's very it's like uh nuances of

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,160
exactly which what

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,839
what version you want to use um i was

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,440
just intrigued as to whether

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,599
it was something you considered and you

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,800
moved away from clearly you

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,200
thought very very deeply about it um

00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,160
so i've got several questions from from

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,720
the comments uh

00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,359
so the first being uh the theme provider

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,200
seems

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,960
very similar to the the material ui

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,760
theme provider i think for reacts

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,319
normally

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,079
um other already pre-built react native

00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,599
libraries that are also able to handle

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:16,079
the theming

00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:18,960
um i yeah from

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,559
it's pretty similar so first of all is

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,200
open source

00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,319
everything on uh react react native is

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,839
open source

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:31,119
so we can get inspired by others but

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:35,680
also um others

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:38,400
can get inspired by us um

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,359
uh previously i've used another design

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,960
on this one but

00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:46,079
i kind of like this um

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,760
this context context concept

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:53,680
because is is much easier to update

00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,200
the for example the the dark mode to

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,319
light mode

00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,599
in a way that's just changing uh that's

00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:03,599
changing

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:07,040
value like what use set steam

00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:09,760
using the metal set team and using um

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,559
setting from light to dark or even on

00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,240
another

00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,240
team if you have multiple teams

00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:20,160
so yeah it makes a lot of sense um

00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,880
so a slightly leading question i think

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,000
but uh

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:29,440
why not just use react native ui kitten

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,440
from the previous month's speakers

00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:37,920
um yeah so why why not

00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:42,319
uh i could have used that you know

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:45,359
but um i've asked a lot of developers

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:48,720
and from my experience

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,839
other developers kind of uh like to

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,880
build

00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:56,400
uh to build the components

00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,440
in-house or the ui

00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:03,680
kits in-house and in

00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,800
that way uh i think i provided

00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:09,359
developers uh freedom

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,240
of choice i mean i have the components

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,599
there a folder

00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:17,200
you can update them

00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:20,240
using react react ui kit kit

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:25,680
kit sorry kitten

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:27,440
so uh i think yeah freedom of choice

00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,640
yeah yeah that's a good point like as

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,920
far as you're building you're giving

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,800
building blocks rather than they're

00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,640
giving like the

00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,240
complete solution so it really depends

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,520
on your use case

00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,400
exactly um so then we've got the next

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,880
one is um

00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,000
dante so he loved your weekly lives and

00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,559
then he also asked

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,200
if he could uh you could share this code

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,480
anywhere

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,920
on github perhaps it's already live

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,400
yeah on github um i think

00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,000
i will provide the link on the chat in

00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,800
the comments is that okay

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,079
yeah that's perfect okay one moment

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:10,960
let me see this one

00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:14,400
i will paste right now

00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,400
done perfect um i'm sure i'm sure dante

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,599
will be pleased um so there the next one

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,440
is um there are no

00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,960
spec tests for the components are there

00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,880
test files somewhere else or

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,880
is that like what kind of structural

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,400
testing you're using

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:32,240
um i didn't add any testing for this one

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:36,319
but i think flow or even

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:40,160
using just or enzyme can be easily added

00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:43,280
to test these ones um i've done this

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,440
on other projects but for this uh

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,400
project i didn't add maybe on the next

00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,839
version i will

00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,880
i will add the testing part it's pretty

00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:57,119
much

00:54:52,880 --> 00:55:01,359
it takes time to write tests

00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:04,799
i think i will add a couple more

00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:07,920
hours on this one i mean yeah

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:10,079
yeah testing from experience um

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,119
to do it well you have to take your time

00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,640
to actually get it right

00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,040
um exactly yeah um so we've got one from

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,040
ben

00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,960
um you had one large components

00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,880
directory do you think creating a common

00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,079
components directory plus other modules

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,599
is good practice

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,470
i suppose this is more going back into

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,799
atomic design debate

00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:30,720
[Music]

00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:34,480
i i do have like a i think

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:37,839
compared to atomic design i have

00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,280
another design it's called lego design

00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:44,000
you have blocks you have blocks

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,200
different ones have different properties

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,240
but you can

00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:51,440
still create other blocks putting

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,160
all together and doing other uh stuff

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,960
with them

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,200
so i think it's lego design it's not a

00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,839
design but lego design

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,280
yeah that's nice that's why that's why

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:06,799
i've named the

00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,799
the view i named it block component

00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,839
someone who's played with far too much

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:15,599
lego in my life i really appreciate that

00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:18,319
um so

00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,839
yeah i think um dante mentioned that he

00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,880
couldn't see the url

00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:26,319
um uh

00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:31,839
i posted here as a as hatman

00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:31,839
johan double v yoga

00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,920
ah sorry okay sorry sir

00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,760
ah sorry okay let me post it here

00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,960
and then um we've got ben mentioned to

00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,400
the style components also exposes their

00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,599
own theme provider so you can pass a

00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,000
custom theme object

00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,920
so i suppose yeah it's it's a similar

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,280
kind of idea to what we were mentioning

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,040
earlier about the different sort of

00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,799
there are lots of different ways to to

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,960
cook the same egg as it were

00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,960
in the um in creating themes

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:11,200
and then dante's also asked

00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,000
can you ask when are you going to finish

00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,520
the last project

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,520
on your on your channel with youtube

00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:27,520
i will i think i need to resume i've

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:30,799
postponed it too much too much time

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:34,480
to resume my my videos on youtube

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:37,680
youtube i've done a lot of cool

00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,880
and beautiful applications there and

00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,760
the other developers uh they've

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,520
they loved it even in the current team

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,640
here on the current project

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:53,359
i have a colleague a developer

00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:56,079
that he said he visited and he learned

00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:58,319
from this channel

00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,359
first time when he started doing react

00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:03,440
native and

00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:06,480
he basically was

00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,799
copying copying everything that i've

00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,799
done

00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:14,160
that i've recorded anyway that okay so

00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:17,280
the uh the app works he wrote

00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:20,640
every piece of code that i've

00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,960
i showed in the video but then he also

00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,240
he

00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,319
uh this this phrase kind of uh

00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:31,520
intrigued me uh he said that uh

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:33,839
i was okay i see the

00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,559
code is working but now i need to

00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,920
understand

00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,440
why it's working you know we developers

00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,280
and we need to understand why it's not

00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,319
working but sometimes the other

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,040
developers are

00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:47,280
thinking okay why is it why is this

00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,280
working you know

00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,720
yeah it's the most important question

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,040
the developer can ask is that it's not

00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,799
just oh it's good it's working is is

00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,319
why or will it continue to do so in the

00:58:54,799 --> 00:59:01,440
future

00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:03,760
exactly don't touch it don't break it

00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,680
i yeah it's not just not do that in our

00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,880
code basis that that sounds like a bad

00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:12,240
idea

00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,240
yeah yeah i know developers jokes

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,079
um so yeah i think i think that's all

00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,000
the questions we have for you

00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,200
um i think obviously thank you for

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,119
coming on it it's been

00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:26,319
a pleasure yeah i think

00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,720
that is us as a meet-up um stay tuned

00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,760
for

00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:32,960
august dates um we'll be posting them

00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,359
in the future and and yeah um

00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,240
thank you all for joining us i hope

00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:40,319
you've all learned

00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:46,990
a thing or two about react native

00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:58,809
thank you very much
