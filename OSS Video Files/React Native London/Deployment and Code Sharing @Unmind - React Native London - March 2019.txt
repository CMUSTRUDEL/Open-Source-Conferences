	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,380
so he's gonna start off by asking a

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,940
quick question the typical sort of throw

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,719
your hands up this is how you're going

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,070
to fly or it's going to die so everybody

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,090
obviously knows what a toothbrush is is

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,090
but who use one of these this morning

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,980
but hey this morning has actually spent

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,769
some time looking after that mind can

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,109
you share your hands so actually quite a

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,910
lot less hands in fact incredible man

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,439
got those hands that kind of but you're

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,680
arguably our minds are much more

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:39,360
important than our teeth and that's why

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,640
we've started on mind so I mind we exist

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,290
to to help employees improve their

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,539
mental health and we do this through

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,050
creating a digital beautiful affordable

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,000
platform and it's clinically valid we

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,890
passionately would believe here our mind

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,190
that everybody has the right to a

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,079
healthy mind I'm sure you're all very

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,120
aware but mental health problems are

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,480
vast in the workplace but also outside

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,380
of the workplace and so just want to

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,439
talk about a few key issues so the

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,510
leading cause of men's health in the

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,729
workplace is absenteeism and this cost

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,869
the UK economy about 42 billion pounds

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,210
per year and this stigmatism around it

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,640
is horrendous so 9 out of 10 people

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,840
would not reveal to their their managers

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,000
that they're actually suffering within

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,229
any mental health issue and you imagine

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,049
the pressure that's putting on something

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,060
that's coming into the workplace you

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,520
know is poorly dealt with and it's

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,740
affecting all organisations so one in

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,790
six employees would experience some form

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,130
of mental mental health issues this year

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,659
so Prince William actually Sunbelt quite

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,700
nicely a couple years ago where he said

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,490
mental health is not a dirty word

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:55,350
we all have mental health like we do

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,509
physical health good or ill and largely

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,850
mental health as a spectrum and we think

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,040
we're all on this spectrum mental health

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,899
and sometimes we move up and down it you

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,489
know monthly yearly hourly and so what

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,100
we do here our mind as we focus on a

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,950
proactive

00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,320
pensive mental health service and we

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,210
also help people get the right care at

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,300
the right time so we've developed the

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,830
online platform proactive preventative

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,130
approach to mental health in the

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,380
workplace using clinically back to tools

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,400
through series what we call epidural

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,410
Learning and Development what we call

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,820
series on the platform tools and

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,670
training which is largely based around

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,670
mindfulness exercises assignments and

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,380
insights and supporting and signposts

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,210
are actually giving you access to the

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,750
right content at the right time if

00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,550
you're in critical state mental health

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,540
well we don't just create a product that

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,740
we just throw it to people we actually

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,290
want these things to be clinically

00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,300
backed so we have four cornerstones that

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,240
we build our platform on and this is

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,970
cognitive behavioral therapy

00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:03,490
neuroscience positive psychology and

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:05,650
mindfulness and beer but it's not just

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,960
us that the love our mind

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,480
we've actually got a lovely bunch of

00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,010
clients that can't be using us these are

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,740
some of my features once it landed in

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,240
the last few months but I'd like to give

00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,180
you a bit of back background a bit of

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,680
stories to unwind and how we started so

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,480
so we're going back a couple of years

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,110
and there were six of us have started

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,370
out on this journey for those who are

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,290
good at mathematics you can see there's

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,820
maybe five yeah I know that's because

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,820
the other co-found was based down in

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,280
South Africa at that time fast forward a

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,130
year back to to keep this to you last

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,230
year that were 12 person team returning

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,120
over three hundred twelve ten thousand

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,640
lands and all revenue for we've secured

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,170
1.4 seed round investment which has

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,870
enabled us to actually build out our

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:55,810
product within mobile and on the web as

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:57,790
well and then just of a few a fee within

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,040
the last few months we're now a QWERTY

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,950
six-person team as at this week I'm

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,050
pleased to say we've got a 1.2 million

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,150
revenue targeted and we've just actually

00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,180
secured a 3 million pound investment

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,250
largely led by an amazing V single tree

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,800
its capital gotta be one of the best

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:20,310
species and you can follow people like

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,310
delivery and Farfetch'd to mention

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,419
so we're growing and we're looking for

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,150
more talent to join our team so the

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:31,870
question is is this you why might you

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,900
want to work here so I'm a big believer

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,270
of Daniel Pink's motivational method and

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,000
so he talks about mastery autonomy

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,560
mastery and purpose so autonomy you know

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,930
we we actually believe people in the

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,060
mind be able to get on and do what they

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,919
want to do without us looking at

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,169
everything they put to apostille

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,180
repository you know your masters of your

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,560
own creation so we believe that you can

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,020
do what you need to do to get the job

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,400
done

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,460
mastery as well you know we're big

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,710
believers that everybody can continue to

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,539
learn and you know we're very humble

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,319
within our team and everybody's learning

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,900
all the time

00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,210
and purpose all of these spoken about

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,130
quite a lot already you know mental

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,340
health is paramount we need to start

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:19,479
addressing this we also have amazing

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,349
tech some of which you can see here some

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,880
of which are going to be talking about

00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:26,610
tonight and also some fantastic benefits

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,900
when you're with us but most importantly

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,490
you get to work with some funky people

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,699
now I'm sure some of you would have been

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,949
introduced this evening well what do

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,979
people think well people actually really

00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:40,780
do enjoy working on mines you know we've

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,630
got a culture of striving for continued

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,430
quality and excellence of product has

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,880
the capacity reverse the trend of

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,520
increasing stressful lives and lastly

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,979
the workplace culture and a text after

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,949
great battle mine too but what's next

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,810
for online we're now actually

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,190
repurposing our entire stack so

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,389
everything you've seen it all the

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,370
clients have got older people we've

00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,319
actually acquired so come work and join

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,139
this journey with us have been built on

00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,669
essentially what's an MVP so now we're

00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:11,259
rebuilding our entire stack from the

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,849
ground up using their technologies that

00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:14,229
I showed you before and actually giving

00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,870
it a lift of pain that you can see here

00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:19,060
I wanna thank you for listening to me

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,159
and they're gonna hand over to Barnes

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,750
who's gonna talk you through some of the

00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,219
tech that we're using here thank you

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,020
very much and thank you to Nick for

continue

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,190
about us I'm one of the full stacks and

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,500
I might I'm very very happy to be here

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,180
talking to all today this is my first

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:40,139
tech talk so be gentle please everyone

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:43,229
so join I mind in August last year and I

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,449
am so glad I did by really 100% we have

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:48,509
as Nick mentioned a really amazing

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,919
continuous learning culture we live free

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,639
and practice mental health and

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:57,180
well-being on a daily basis we have fun

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,159
social events and even have a few dogs

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,479
that come every now and again this is

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:04,050
Jeanie

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:12,419
she's a Maltese from Hitler design I

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:15,750
know so if you like dogs okay okay so

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:17,610
the agenda gonna be talking about our

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,069
stack which nick has already alluded to

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,560
a little bit on how we're deploying that

00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:24,740
stack out to iOS Android and the web

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,169
then I'll show a little bit of a demo

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:31,610
and then some code sharing well how we

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:35,190
are finding we can do code sharing with

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:39,870
using react for the web and very

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:43,710
animated for our mobile app so we

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:46,680
currently have a v1 the MVP as nickers

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,650
and set and you know we have a database

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,509
with a scheme already using a CMS and

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,229
and then on top of that we have a node

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:56,310
API using graph QL and so you know we

00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,190
need to keep that running that's out

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,069
with all the clients that next mentioned

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:05,009
and so that is kind of like the bedrock

00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:09,060
that we that we have to keep keep

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:11,659
building on top of so you before our API

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:18,110
and state management we've gone with my

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:22,050
it is you know the de-facto client for

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,069
for graph QL and so we found it in it's

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,779
gonna be grateful

00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,550
obviously that sort of things but then

00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,550
it's got loads of great state management

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,900
filled in we have a lot less state than

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,779
you would probably need if you wanted to

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,039
go down the Redux reap so you know it

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,750
makes much more sense for us to just

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,219
keep everything

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:43,219
Paulo and you know write less code which

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,870
is always good in the in the end and

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,690
then obviously you know you're all here

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,310
because of these - probably the bottom

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,850
one I should have put that on the top of

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,130
these organizers but yeah you know yet

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,130
mate it is the most performant hybrid

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,860
app system out there and thanks to you

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,090
know the underlying technologies of the

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,290
epigenesis virtual Dom you know it's

00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,440
it's really really performant and

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,990
somebody said so yeah we also chose

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,770
these two because we're hoping to you

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,680
know have some Kobe's between the two

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:22,190
two projects obviously there is a very

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:25,730
very active and current community you're

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,950
here right get loads and loads of good

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,570
questions on Stack Overflow one thing we

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:35,930
noticed was our v1 is in angularjs 1.6

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,960
and yeah questions are not being asked

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,760
anymore so we're thank overflowed was

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,690
not my friend for for that project

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:48,400
anymore and then obviously for a little

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:52,370
bit of time safety we've gone for a

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,020
typescript hug around those two I know

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,820
you loved here at the talk last week

00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:00,140
that what we hate gave about you know

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,140
achieving amazing velocity with with

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,930
typescript but yeah it is awesome right

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,339
and I find out you know errors that I've

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,450
been writing in my favor before I even

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:14,420
realized it tells me through our IDE

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,740
praise readability velocity and for

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,680
making a really robust for in fact the

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:22,400
refactoring as well right so a little

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,040
bit on deployment I know it sounds silly

00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,620
right but I love the women I know it's

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,210
you know a little bit of a kind of man

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,940
configuration would really have to do

00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,170
this but you know with that the

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,900
pointment none of our stuff will get out

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,820
there right

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,270
you know it's it's the reason everything

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,200
is deployed is is visible certain people

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:50,750
outside of our own local houses and so

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,750
yeah I'm a bit of a deployment not thing

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:59,279
I'm not a thing okay so anyway

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,500
everything is based on bitbucket that's

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,029
where what I read bazaar and then for

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,300
the read native app on iOS we're using

00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:08,160
fast link to do the highlights you know

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,130
provisioning and stiff exciting and so

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,450
on and then that's all going up through

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,020
a visual studio App Center

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:20,180
oh yeah Android key find stuff lately

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,620
and then use the key spot there and then

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:27,529
yeah that's that's kind of how we get

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:31,620
our iOS through is through test flight

00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:33,930
and Android is with implementing the

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,190
Android alpha at the moment and I'm sure

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:40,770
you always it's so yeah there's a few

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,400
kind of builders that we've had with App

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:47,250
Center you need to kind of configure a

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,920
feature branch for each time you want to

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,080
kind of have that feature available to

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,390
for people to test it can be automated

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,060
with the API and so we are we're going

00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:59,760
to do that and but yeah it's been a few

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,990
team problems with it one of the other

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,709
things was you know lack of support of

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,270
SSH which has been tricky but you know

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,500
there are ways around it there's always

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,320
stuff the main work with appointment

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,300
right putting a VM to commit on a

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,760
feature branch and then see it you know

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,630
in tests white ten twenty minutes later

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,130
is ugly right and it's all about chain

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,230
but we play it built to our product team

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,300
we have to touch XK we don't have such

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,770
Android studio obviously they're

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,910
installed because it'd be one but you

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:36,089
know it's being like and thanks to

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:37,410
Laurie and I'll eat you know if it's a

00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,360
might work because it's made always

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,720
really really helpful and really easy

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,680
and productive and yeah it goes great

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:49,260
okay so the apps so far and

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,200
I've got them both side by side and as

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:55,890
you saw from Nick's writes this is

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,110
series so series are all about the

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,470
basics at the heart of the educational

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,450
component of our platform they are a

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,880
multimedia learning and development

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:09,090
program or programs which are designed

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,610
to you tell I took this from probably

00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:14,310
guys okay they're really like you know

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,650
they cover a full spectrum of mental

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,540
health all the way from their problems

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,710
all the way through to to thriving

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,850
which is you know really really awesome

00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,170
as you can see they're divided into a

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,260
number of categories here we're going

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:33,420
into a series and into the days of the

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:35,640
series so I was finished and now we'll

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,620
move over to the mobile app so you can

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,370
see there's a lot of bits that are

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:45,090
happening in both you know we have to

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,460
have our mobile app providing

00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,290
essentially the same experience same

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,560
level of content they know that our web

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,750
app does and so that has obviously

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,410
provided some potential for code sharing

00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:01,170
and code reuse between the two products

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:08,580
so I'll just wait for my dough into a

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:09,900
spot so yeah as you can see from the few

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,890
interaction differences that we've got

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,090
like the view all button on there on web

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:18,240
yeah we have that same offering so

00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:21,030
because of this we can found that you

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,490
know we saw that we could live that

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,870
there's a possibility to reuse a lot and

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,790
we have found that we've been able to

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,720
essentially like higher order components

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,710
that we using through graph QL and

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,580
orthographic or higher or the components

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:39,030
that we can use with for our API calls

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:42,600
you know fact that is all in um in a

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:45,840
shared repo so what I'm going to do you

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,340
just look at the banner at the top the

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,780
current functionality for like for the

00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,180
series banner there if you're in the

00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,990
middle of a series it will prompt you to

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,150
click continue

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,700
otherwise it will display a carousel of

00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,390
featured series and so there's just dive

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,230
into that little Karen

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:06,400
I can show you what what I mean by

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:10,810
Kobe's okay so we got react native on

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:16,000
the left grab deer on the right anyone

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:19,180
spot any differences a he must have

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,690
written was it red native web or

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,210
something

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,710
alright native Dom yeah I mean that's it

00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,930
right there's literally we can just

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,120
reuse you know this whole thing apart

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,600
from the view and the dip which is

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,260
awesome

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,850
I know a bit later the whole party on

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,060
react native web and we have made Saddam

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:39,850
but you know this is something we could

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:42,370
we can we can reuse them so if you then

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:46,150
look at a at the hop so this is slightly

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:49,180
the query further graphic over that soft

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:52,420
and then the the high-water component

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,950
there so I don't know I'm sure you

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,170
probably all know this but the hybrid

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:59,560
component is a function that takes in a

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,900
component and then returns a new one in

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,960
the case of Apollo a hybrid component

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,910
except to combine and pass in props

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,240
derive from request responses or a

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,260
function and all the function to carry

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,090
out a graph QL

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:17,770
query or mutation also has vendor props

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,320
which is kind of a little bit of a

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,030
different way of doing things these

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,690
except to function as a child and pass

00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:28,300
in arguments with they saw from the

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,820
requester responses and or a function

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,040
carry out the the query or mutation

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,610
mutations for those monograph go ahead

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,420
czars and she inserts or you know saving

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:42,790
data writing data rather than you know

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,440
but reading it retrieving it in the more

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,310
common kind of work with with creepers

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,290
about okay so we decided to go with the

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,600
the hoc kind of pattern rather than read

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,880
the props because we often get data for

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,110
a page with a you know

00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,030
number of different queries because of

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,890
the nested miss of our of our series

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,319
because we got series than Tuesday and

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,520
then segments and so on so we've

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,020
basically found that because of this if

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,660
we went down that render proof window

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,240
box root we would enter into some crazy

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,020
fallback hell from which we wouldn't

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,470
have a return so yeah a Polish composes

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:26,390
is much neater and that's kind of the

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:28,560
main reason for us following that yeah

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:34,280
so basically we found that we've been

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:37,530
able to share all of the API box from

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:44,850
both projects in one place which has

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:47,280
been really really cool so yeah okay so

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,780
yeah that's that's what we've done on a

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,950
kind of co-chairing kind of side of

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:55,470
things so so far we've got also

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:58,320
typography and colors and that's you

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,170
know sharing icons between the two we

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,780
also share our lifting rules there we go

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,990
and so I was thinking for picking at the

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:12,630
next one rather than the current one and

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:15,350
then customers from API bellies I was

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,810
going to take that one out but forgotten

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,130
but yeah we haven't got to vote for

00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,810
vendor side of things but army

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,190
connectors give a custom areas for

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,140
example in locking that'd be one of them

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,360
so the user around power because you

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,590
want to kind of keep it as a as secure

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,090
as possible so we're not going to say

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,240
you know we don't have that email but

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,160
you know how do you have you signed up

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,490
you know we want to keep it keep it kind

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,080
of pretty vague okay and then obviously

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,050
the code I've mentioned hawks and then

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,670
also interfaces and types because you

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,700
know a series is a series to us it is to

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:51,630
our API and so it should be shareable

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,340
between the Maya and the women cool so

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,050
how do we do it it's pretty pretty

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,950
simple really

00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,350
we just used internal repos that

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:04,660
attacked further burgeoning and then

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:06,310
using webpack we also have just some

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:10,360
configuration on the inter entries of

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:11,860
the web web pack so we could yeah

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,870
basically kind of drill down into the

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:20,550
different sort of parts and features of

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:20,550
the of the app okay thank you

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,700
