	Unifying React Native Across All Platforms - by Peter Piekarczyk (https://twitter.com/peterpme)

When React Native first came out it was primarily meant as a way to build mobile apps using React. Since those humble beginnings, the React Native ecosystem has exploded and supports much more than just mobile. From the Xbox, to the desktop, to the web: there's a React Native experience for you.

In this talk I will go over the exciting developments 2020 has brought that makes this easier and go over the different platforms you can target with React Native. I will also share case studies for companies that have successfully made this work!
