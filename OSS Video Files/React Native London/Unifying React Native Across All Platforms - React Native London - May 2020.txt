Playlist: React Native London
Description: 
	Unifying React Native Across All Platforms - by Peter Piekarczyk (https://twitter.com/peterpme)

When React Native first came out it was primarily meant as a way to build mobile apps using React. Since those humble beginnings, the React Native ecosystem has exploded and supports much more than just mobile. From the Xbox, to the desktop, to the web: there's a React Native experience for you.

In this talk I will go over the exciting developments 2020 has brought that makes this easier and go over the different platforms you can target with React Native. I will also share case studies for companies that have successfully made this work!

hello hello hello hey everyone sorry I

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,519
can't be there today thank you for

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,980
having me

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,929
I guess none of you all are there today

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,410
right because like the office is closed

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,070
and stuff but thank you for having me

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,380
anyway

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,760
I really miss London I had such a great

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,609
time when I came out there in August

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,260
also spoke at react native London back

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,400
then that was a really great opportunity

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,830
to meet all of you and we had a really

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,500
good time afterwards I generally just

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,290
just miss it so sad that it can't be

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,960
there today but super happy that thanks

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,329
to technology we can make this happen

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,780
and also thanks to taping my phone to

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,670
the screen to make this recording higher

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,550
quality that's something you can't see

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,410
but I'm throwing it out there anyway

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,550
today we'll be talking about unifying

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,190
react native across all platforms

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:02,280
potentially a controversial topic full

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,100
of exciting information we're going to

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,380
talk about a little bit of Expo a little

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,600
bit of react native a little bit of

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,689
Microsoft stuff and a little bit of

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,680
reason which I particularly always

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:20,640
admire anyway if you haven't heard of me

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,700
my name is Peter Picard chick this is

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,220
the photo that I used to use and I still

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,110
do back when I had a beard when I came

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,540
to visit all of you I did have a beard

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,729
but now I'm just sort of doing this like

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:42,750
clean-shaven kovat 19 pandemic locked in

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:45,149
my house look going back to the topic my

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,009
last name is pronounced PI's cars and

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,229
chicks right it comes up all the time

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,420
how do you pronounce your last name pies

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,600
cars and chicks that's that's a lot

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,549
easier right I'm the co-founder and CTO

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,049
of draft bit which we'll talk about in a

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,420
second I'm a Y Combinator alum w18

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:05,520
winter eighteen batch we started as

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,259
orchard and a pivoting to draft it so

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,860
crazy to think about it's been almost

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,390
two years I created an Apollo query

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,760
components view up hollowed out a couple

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,519
years

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,140
so if you used query components I played

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,239
somewhat of a role in that

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:25,659
a Mexico's first user believe it or not

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:28,420
I love reason reason react I host the

00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:30,310
conference in Chicago and I help

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,379
contribute and also maintain a

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,989
contribute a few popular JavaScript

00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:38,739
libraries that you may or may not have

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,870
heard of anyway so if you haven't heard

00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:42,700
of draft bit we help teams build mobile

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,560
apps

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,420
the oboe laps of people build are really

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,970
cool and the mobile apps that we also

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,310
build can be run as pwace directly in

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,720
the browser right so it's pretty cool we

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,540
just launched this new website on web

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,519
flow check it out if you you know if you

00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,109
haven't it's actually really cool we got

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,730
all these like animations kind of goes

00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:03,459
over you know bringing your screens to

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,760
life all that marketing jazz that you

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,170
know that gets you excited anyway I'm

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,010
pretty proud of because we just launched

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,079
it the source code that we generate for

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,599
your apps is pretty high quality right

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,730
so this whole like low code no code

00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,440
thing is becoming pretty popular but the

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,540
difference between us and a lot of our

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,150
competitors is that we still give you

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,810
access to your source code and that's a

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,489
huge deal right a lot of the times these

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,199
services are using templates or some

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,340
form of that behind the scenes they're

00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,040
just a plug-and-play your data and

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,919
that's great but you know for a tool as

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,310
powerful as ours we want you to be able

00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,280
to pass that off to you know a different

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,569
team or eject and work on whatever else

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,699
you weren't capable of doing without

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,590
having to throw out your source code so

00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,579
we strive for making that source code

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:58,299
super high quality now I was watching my

00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,340
talk from August and I just sort of

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,650
stumbled over a screenshot of what the

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,079
Builder looked like back then right and

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,690
this is about 2019 right this toy that

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,699
we had right now I took a screenshot of

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,790
what that looks like today check out

00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:15,340
this check this out right not only did

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,130
we update the theme for whatever reason

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,120
we we are now a power tool right we went

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:24,310
from being just a toy to a power

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,310
powerful power tool right this web

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,430
preview works a lot better and we run

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,650
phonce we render your assets you've got

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,540
the ability to set any sort of prop from

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,060
the react native side directly in draft

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,639
it that's pretty powerful folks have

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,470
been able to build their apps like from

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,690
a sketch designer whatever in a matter

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,200
of hours yes believe it it's true it's

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,169
nuts

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,570
but anyway enough about that selling

00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,940
pitch why am I here today well so

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,930
currently drafted targets two platforms

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:58,080
right the web via pwace random mobile

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,400
iOS and Android we use the same API but

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,510
why so why can't we pursue other

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,720
platforms well we're not there yet this

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:10,680
is something that I'm personally just uh

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,270
you know looking into I don't know much

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,310
about it I don't know what our users

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,710
think of it but I have discovered some

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,450
really cool things that have come out in

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,970
2020 and I'd love to share those with

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,760
you all today the internet obviously has

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,169
a lot of ideas too so what you'll see is

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,560
just sort of a collection of different

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:30,510
things that folks are doing and I'm

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,160
going to try to keep things as objective

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,720
as possible

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,010
but it gives you an idea of like some

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,570
paths that you can pursue right so now

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,340
when it comes to building layouts draft

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,140
it supports everything under the Sun

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,270
right you can build your entire layout

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,250
really really quickly so what's stopping

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,890
us from turning this on well we could

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,930
right there is arguably nothing stopping

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,240
you from building your Apple TV I've

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,460
been tried drafted but the reality is

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,940
that nobody's asked for it yet so it

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,620
doesn't matter right also like a big

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,450
proportion of that to at a big portion

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,280
of like all of you know the problem

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,740
behind this is that even though the

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,130
primitives are the same there are a lot

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,740
of nuances between different platforms

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,350
obviously right we're used to specific

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,440
experiences on iOS on Android on our

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,780
Apple TV or Xbox or Playstation etc

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,760
right so even though we might apply the

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:29,490
same like declar divide ia's right

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,889
it doesn't necessarily play out the same

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,470
way in practice right we we like to keep

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:37,380
our experiences the same now the world

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,540
has done a really good job of unifying

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,210
ios and android so far

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,980
right sometimes we like to go down

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,960
specific you know like I'm going to use

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,250
material UX and building an Android app

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,920
or I'm going to use hIgG because I'm

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,800
building a ILS app but there have been

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,240
some really nice

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,300
apps that were designed that were

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,220
cross-platform right now I'm sort of

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,050
entering this new phase where can we get

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,760
that working on the web can we get that

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,240
working on the desktop right we'll talk

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,830
about a little more that every once in a

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,620
while we hear this phrase like write

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,510
once run everywhere right you've heard

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,920
like write once use everywhere to and

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,200
that's that's sort of a derivative of

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,390
this right and this is sort of a dream

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,000
that we haven't realized but may

00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,980
eventually realize I've seen some clever

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,870
techniques to make this happen but we're

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,300
far from you know doing this

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,020
reproduction it you know very far from

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,220
it right it's still the reality is

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,770
possible we're just a couple of years

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,540
away and things that make this problem

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,940
really really hard are obviously

00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,560
different screen sizes right stark

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,990
difference between an iPhone and the

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,510
Apple TV right that's like a thing I

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,940
have a 60-inch TV at home right in my

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,790
Apple is like 6 inches my iPhone is 6

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,890
inches different interactions right I

00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,590
interact with my phone with my finger by

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:59,070
touching things and swiping I use my web

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,480
browser by using my mouse pad or just a

00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,530
normal mouse and scrolling right or even

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,060
your keyboard my xbox is a controller

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,650
right which is much different than

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:13,530
either a mouse pad keyboard or swipe and

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,790
touch right and then lastly like I've

00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,470
mentioned earlier the different user

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,420
experiences right I'm used to a certain

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,720
experience on my Android machine I'm

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,340
used to a certain experience on Windows

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:29,040
and I'm used to a certain experience on

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:31,590
iOS right the easiest example that I

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,060
could come up with like let the tip of

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,110
the iceberg when it comes to this

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,060
problem is the date picker right we have

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,270
different date/time Pickers across

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,530
Android and iOS for whatever reason you

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,290
know opinions are always different and

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:49,110
one could be better than the other so on

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,810
Android we have this thing that sort of

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,220
pops up right it's got the material UI

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,160
theme right and then

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,370
that's what you use on iOS you have this

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,230
inline date and time picker right

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,000
doesn't show up in a modal or a pop-up

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,970
right it's inline you can place it

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,020
anywhere so and react native was first

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:14,220
coming out we had to separate and Stark

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:17,430
vastly different api's right the Android

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,410
date picker was imperative right you

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,570
would have to call a function that would

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,430
then open it up and the experience would

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,630
be completely controlled right and then

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,230
you get your date and time you'd be done

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:31,650
on iOS the date/time picker was a

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,940
component write a declaration that would

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,190
take a visible prompt they would either

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,680
show or hide they have your on change

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,410
handler right so you'd have to manage

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,060
the space of where that goes as well as

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,290
any type of pop-up if you wanted there

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,760
right otherwise it would just show up

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:49,590
inline good and bad on both sides right

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,740
but the community has made that easier

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:55,070
right a great case study of how we can

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,170
head towards the direction of

00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,710
cross-platform success is by unifying

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,320
these experiences right the react Native

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,050
community is fantastic if you haven't

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,430
seen it on github it's really nice right

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:13,290
they offer a lot of different packages

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:15,390
ok let me open this up they offer a lot

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,940
of different packages that will come in

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,140
handy right

00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,450
the day time picker is one of them

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,390
another really popular one that they

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,030
have is Bob right Bob is a tool written

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,560
by Satya that makes the process of

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,470
scaffolding and building react native

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,310
apps whether they're specifically to

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,080
their native platforms or the web right

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,100
they make it easy to build react native

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,350
libraries right no more handling of type

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,380
script or whatever that you need to do

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,020
or babble or flow it just does it for

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:54,680
you right the same way that you know

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,680
micro bundle or TST X would do right

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,690
when it comes to react native community

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,640
there's also some exciting repos like if

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,440
you've seen what's been going on when

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,810
the react native world's lately right of

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,150
making course smaller a lot of

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,910
those components are ending up here

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,920
right video async storage the daytime

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,680
picture the camera the web view etc

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,250
right so if you're looking for a place

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,660
with really high quality components for

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,960
react native nothing check out react and

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,410
community now on the other end of that

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,020
reason is also making this easier right

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:35,310
if you haven't heard of reason reason is

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:38,610
this language lets you write simple and

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:42,120
type safe and very very fast JavaScript

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:47,520
looking code so it's got a JavaScript

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:51,750
like the syntax with that's powered by

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,700
the Oh camel API right and so you can

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,460
use reason for a variety of different

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,800
things for web for native right it

00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,360
compiles onto byte code right which

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,370
means forget the JavaScript layer

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,080
altogether give me a small bundle and

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,410
I'll talk about that in a second there's

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,480
also a reason react right so reason was

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:13,380
actually created by the creator of react

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,600
fun fact right and reason react the

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,040
pitch there is a safer simpler way to

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,690
build react components right you get a

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,970
great site type system with an even

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,380
better developer experience right and

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,110
you can watch the video Jordan walked a

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,880
creative react fun fact the first talk

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,280
that Jordan gave

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,790
since releasing react in 2013 it's

00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:36,960
pretty cool anyway so now a little bit

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,310
about why reason is making this easier

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,850
right like how is this all coming

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,330
together Peter well there's this tool

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:49,020
called reverie UI right and what reverie

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:52,610
you Y is is a library written in native

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:55,709
reason that compiles to the web and

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,740
native desktop apps right targeting

00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:03,209
Linux Windows Mac OS with one code base

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:07,410
you can go across all all those react

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:09,209
native iOS Android derivative is in the

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,459
works right but right now it's only that

00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,930
well I've got this gift right here and

00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,700
usually can see it's a little laggy but

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,650
that's not what it's like right this is

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,780
a smooth animal excuse me smooth

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,100
animations running directly in the

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,720
browser they've got a lot of great

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,879
examples

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,379
you hover calculator or whatever they

00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,899
take a second to compile something worth

00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:29,360
checking out

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:31,370
ken wheeler built this app called camel

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,589
since I actually downloaded it and it's

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,709
blazingly fast like did you see that it

00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:38,480
opens up instantly right the nice thing

00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:42,470
about these apps is are super small and

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,689
they're very light on memory an example

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,089
of what that looks like is jared

00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:49,370
Foresight's

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:51,500
kimochi app right so we've all used the

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,199
emoji date picker I think we have or

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,410
just the emoji picker right I think it's

00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:59,420
a command control space or whatever it

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,670
is you get some og there well he decided

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,379
to rebuild that in reason to see like

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,620
what it's capable of and he compared it

00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:08,779
against there was a different version of

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,660
it called mochi bar right mochi bar is

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:15,920
an electron app q mo G is a reason app

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,319
right say an exact style of code right

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,480
same exact functions all it does is show

00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:22,970
you all the emojis and the ability to

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,230
search for those it's quite snappy it's

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:29,000
very fast and it works as a menu bar app

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,980
then lastly in terms of like

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,230
cross-platform stuff there's oniy them

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,889
right and that's a text editor it's

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,410
written in reason powered by live them

00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,720
which is them under the hood and it

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,699
supports all of the BS code language

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,889
servers and extensions right so you get

00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:48,920
this really really fast text editor that

00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,420
opens up immediately right that uses

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,100
your favorite vs cut extension it's

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,199
definitely worth checking out they're in

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:59,300
an alpha it's a paid product that's 35

00:14:54,199 --> 00:15:01,069
bucks but I strongly recommend are you

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,730
taking a look it's totally worth it it's

00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:07,430
super fast I love it so how does all

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,470
this compare to electron right before we

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,939
get too far ahead right we're talking

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,170
about like a completely different

00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,910
language that does a lot of different

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,490
things that gives us some exciting

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,769
results right so electron apps were

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,319
written in JavaScript and what they do

00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:23,089
is they bundle up the entire node engine

00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:25,339
v8 right which is a minimum of 120

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,410
megabytes that means that if you wanted

00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:30,110
to build a simple hello world app in

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:33,230
electron the app would be at least a

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,650
hundred and twenty megabytes humo G on

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:39,140
the other hand right

00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:41,390
which doesn't use electron is a measly

00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,430
three point four megabytes right and

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,190
then it uses half the memory of mochi

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,750
bar two that's pretty exciting right

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,029
it's also worth pointing out that

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,490
electron apps don't mean react natives

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:54,500
right they mean any type of JavaScript

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,290
for example atom envious code are

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,560
written using electron but they don't

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:03,560
use reacts and that's okay

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:07,670
so when you want to compare referee and

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,400
reason to electron well what they do is

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,230
they compiled to native bytecode your

00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:16,160
apps are small and fast and they just

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,510
work right there's no JavaScript layer

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,900
that it needs to talk to it strips all

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,550
of that out while retaining the same

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,500
structure oh before I get too far ahead

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,990
I had this open this is the website for

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,880
Oni then it's uneven that IO 35 bucks

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,310
it's really really cool they've got the

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,550
public roadmap right it's a great it's

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:37,640
actually someone from think that

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,530
Microsoft typescript team don't quote me

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,450
on that but they switched over to using

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,390
a reason on reverie and built this

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:48,170
amazing infrastructure for an editor

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:50,780
anyway so now I'm moving on what are

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,910
other options right so there's react

00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,170
native Windows and Mac OS right so it

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,270
does react native Windows and then

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,010
there's react native Mac OS and those do

00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,070
exactly what you'd think them to do

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,230
right interestingly enough when I was

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,600
working on this presentation Microsoft

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,760
just like unveiled an overhaul of react

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,380
native Windows which is pretty cool

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,240
and what you can do if it's not already

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,310
obvious use the react native primitives

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,990
to build a desktop apps for Mac OS and

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,510
Windows there's still that JavaScript

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:23,120
layer right that still lives there but

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,780
the nice part is is the same exact

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,600
primitives that you're used to apply to

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,370
apply to desktop apps now I'm not a

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,410
Windows person but I know some of you

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,550
are right you might be wondering how is

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,260
this different than the universal

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:41,270
Windows platform well the same way that

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,670
react native uses iOS and Android native

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,450
components under the hood react native

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:50,450
windows uses Universal Windows platform

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:55,610
Twp under their hood right so the same

00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:57,350
idea same characters with the bridge but

00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,789
they just talk to different component

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,919
under the hood right so it's a really

00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:02,750
cool and exciting project you should

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,789
check out especially if you want to

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,539
build a Mac OS app I've always wanted to

00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:10,399
do that but obviously timing is rough so

00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:12,019
maybe what I'll do is I'll take draft

00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:15,919
they try to compile it to that using

00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:18,889
those primitives what else okay so

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,980
another really cool demo that I've seen

00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:24,889
lately is cross you rode and what is

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:28,580
Crossy Road Crossy Road is an example of

00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:30,380
a game written using expo web right so

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,690
maybe you've played this before right

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,010
there's an Apple TV app for it it's it's

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,200
really cool check out those animations

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:40,130
check out how smooth that is right so

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,110
this works for native mobile or native

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,139
iOS and Android right and it also works

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:47,059
on the web with one code base right and

00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:51,200
that's because Expo has recently

00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:54,139
introduced support for pwace right that

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,510
means same code base same api's that

00:18:54,139 --> 00:19:00,919
worked really nicely across different

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:03,350
platforms right and the nice part about

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,470
this is is that they do a very good job

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:11,720
of gracefully degrading the experience

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:13,610
for uh you know api's that don't exist

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,799
on the web right we all know what the

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,690
web is like and we all know that native

00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:21,769
android now must have better things like

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,940
permissions and gyroscope and all these

00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,139
different things that we can't use on

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,340
the web right and they do a very good

00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:27,320
job in making sure that your app doesn't

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,039
crash right but you still get to use the

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,950
same API and how that works is expo web

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:38,649
uses react native web right react native

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:41,480
web is a library let's open this up

00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:44,779
react native web is a library developed

00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,700
by Nicolaus at twitter and what it does

00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:49,630
is it takes the react native primitives

00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,850
and makes them work in the browser right

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,809
and twitter isn't a great example of a

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:59,389
PWA i have powered by it's actually

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,890
powered by wrap native web right it was

00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:03,680
actually pioneered at twitter

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,720
you go to twitter.com on your browser on

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,100
your mobile phone what it does is it

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,590
opens up a PWA and basically sinks some

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,210
caches the a player and then only

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,700
fetches the data right so if you turn

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,320
off your internet connection right now

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,970
Twitter would still be usable right you

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,040
wouldn't get any new stuff but it's not

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,510
like that typical experience where

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:28,190
everything is sort of fails right so

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,530
it's one of the ways that we a draft bit

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,020
power our builder right we give you the

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,830
live preview center screen of what's

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,960
going on in the web browser and also on

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:42,790
your mobile phone and we use some of

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,620
that to power our own stuff okay now

00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:48,980
expo HTML analyst was recently released

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:52,940
right so what this is is a component

00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:55,010
library lets you use HTML elements like

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,440
block code and heading one two three

00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,730
four five and and blink and footer and

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,750
all the each elements that you've heard

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:04,910
of as react native components right so

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,460
you might be wondering like wow another

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,440
like what do i do with this right well

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,180
the nice thing about expo HTML elements

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,360
is that they will help you optimize your

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,240
SEO and accessibility right because they

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,090
use the same primitives that the web

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,090
offers right they compile and degrade

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,710
nicely across native and iOS too so

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,450
here's an example of what that looks

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,030
like so you've got on the left hand side

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,980
snack explore that IO open write which

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,630
is like a website and you've got the

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,940
phone running on the right hand side

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,310
right so it does this really nice job of

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,650
put any other header the footer the main

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:42,320
title article section right like I'll

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:45,380
just like native components and so on

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,200
the left hand side is the HTML web

00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,080
experience right and so whatever net

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,170
expose done is apply that same concept

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,810
to mobile right that's really really

00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:59,840
cool so if you want to lou differences

00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,370
between react native web and HTML

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,130
elements is like they're sort of reverse

00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,740
so wrapping of web brings view text

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,730
image and all those fun things to the

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:14,190
browser right and HTML elements bring

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:17,970
things like a cyan article bold

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,919
native right another really cool thing

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,769
that expose done recently is universal

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,519
authentication flows and what this means

00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:30,539
that you can write these same API for

00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:32,639
logging into Twitter logging into github

00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:37,679
logging into whatever service that you

00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:39,509
want directly from using the same exact

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,600
code base right and that's super super

00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:43,950
cool the docs are super well put

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,350
together as you can see here I was like

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:50,250
scrolling for a specific thing can't

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:52,200
find it but oh here it is right so they

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:55,169
they offer everything from coinbase

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,570
Apple Facebook Spotify slack github

00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:59,730
Dropbox identity for uber read and okhta

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,399
Google the list goes on

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:06,929
right and now that experience will work

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:08,299
on the web and on mobile right awesome

00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,230
that's what I have to share for today

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,659
make sure you follow me on Twitter

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,580
twitter.com slash Peter PME same with

00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,230
github Peter PME all the way across the

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,419
board and if you're interested check out

00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,879
traffic bit despite everything going on

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,320
in the world rapid is still hiring if

00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:24,750
you're interested in the space if you're

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,090
into visual programming right I still

00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,889
consider that programming whether or not

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,149
you're typing code or doing something

00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:34,139
there's still this whole thought process

00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:36,870
behind it right so please reach out

00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:39,509
we're hiring and hopefully folks liked

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,230
this idea with notion so I wanted to try

00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:41,669
something different

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,409
hopefully you all didn't hate me for it

00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:45,509
but I put together my presentation in

00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:47,250
notion I figured since we're all virtual

00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,679
right it might be a little easier for me

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,360
for doing demos and embedding things so

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,830
I'm sure I'll seeing that YouTube

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,299
comments whether you like it or not you

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:58,200
know it's easily you can thumbs down it

00:23:54,299 --> 00:24:00,960
or you know tweet something really bad

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,409
or whatever but I'll know and that way

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,549
I'll know number to do it again anyway

00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:08,309
I'm gonna share this link with all of

00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,600
you there's plenty to learn from here

00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:11,549
I'll put a lot of ring clinks I'm here

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,649
for reason react reverie react native

00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,470
web rip native windows cross hero don't

00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:19,019
even even the correct native TV OS which

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,960
I didn't talk about but anyway thank you

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,850
so much again for having me I can't wait

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,929
to see everybody in person once this is

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,490
all over

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:30,660
until then see

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,660
