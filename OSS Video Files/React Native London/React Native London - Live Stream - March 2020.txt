üíª The Talk(s)

1) MobX - state management with no boilerplate - by Mike Borozdin

MobX, unlike Redux, requires little boilerplate and provides a centralised place for your business logic. In this talk, we'll do live coding and move an existing app written with Redux to MobX.

2) Building a web-like workflow for React Native - by Kamile and Hentie

Modern web development is spoilt for tools when it comes to deployment, with easy automated testing and deployment previews giving you fast feedback on your changes in isolation. At Kantan we had a look at how we can get some of the same benefits in a React Native pipeline.
