Description: 
	Presented by Alexis Mangin.

At Zopa, we’re building a mobile application to help people feel more in control of their finances. Over the last few years, we’ve worked hard to build a modular and scalable application that can be extended by all our product teams. How did we manage to keep up? We will give you an overview of our project structure, why we use feature flags in the app and our work toward continuous deployment.

About Pusher Sessions:

We're bringing the meetup to you. With Sessions, you can watch recordings of top-notch talks from developer meetups -- wherever and whenever you want.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.

If you run a meetup and want to get involved, kindly get in touch.
