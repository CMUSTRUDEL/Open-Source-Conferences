	LAS16-410: Don’t waste power when idle with runtime PM
Speakers: Ulf Hansson
Date: September 29, 2016

★ Session Description ★
For a while Linaro has been working on improving some components of the PM core infrastructure. In this session we will touch system PM, runtime PM and the generic PM domain frameworks. Moreover we will show how to deploy system PM support via the so called runtime PM centric approach. The goal is to enable people to write simpler PM code in subsystem/drivers, as well as help avoid wasting power when a device or a system is idle.
