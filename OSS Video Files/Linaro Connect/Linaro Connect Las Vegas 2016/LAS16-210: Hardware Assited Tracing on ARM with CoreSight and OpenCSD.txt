	LAS16-210: Hardware Assisted Tracing on ARM with CoreSight and OpenCSD
Speakers: Mathieu Poirier
Date: September 27, 2016

★ Session Description ★
The CoreSight framework available in the Linux kernel has recently been integrated with the standard Perf trace system, making HW assisted tracing on ARM systems accessible to developers working on a wide spectrum of products. This presentation will start by giving a brief overview of the CoreSight technology itself before presenting the current solution, from trace collection in kernel space to off system trace decoding. To help with the latter part the Open CoreSight Decoding Library (openCSD) is introduced. OpenCSD is an open source library assisting with the decoding of collected trace data. We will see how it is used with the existing perf tools to provide an end-to-end solution for CoreSight trace decoding. The presentation will conclude with trace acquisition and decoding scenarios, along with tips on how to interpret trace information rendered by the perf tools.
