Speakers: Bjorn Andersson

★ Session Description ★
Today the remoteproc & rpmsg code available in mainline serves as a base for numerous out-of-tree implementations, ranging from bug fixes to larger feature additions. As we’re discussing how to bring these additions towards mainline a common set of topics shows up between the various trees. This talk serves to give an insight into these discussions, ongoing work and connect people with interest in these subsystems.
