	LAS16-101: Efficient kernel backporting
Speakers: Alex Shi
Date: September 26, 2016

★ Session Description ★
In computer/mobile product world, due to the stability, project timeline, etc considerations, latest upstream kernel isn’t their preference. The long term stable kernel is. But if you want to some of the latest features which only is in upstream kernel,you will have to backport them to old stable kernel. This presentation will share the kernel feature backport experience with audience, help them understand how to do backports quickly and effectively without detailed knowledge of the target feature, thus giving more flexibility and Improving productivity when making products. We will use some examples, to discuss how to get info from backport request, how to find necessary commits, how to get dependency, how to resolve conflicts, and finally how to test it.

	00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:17,130
welcome in my station this is a fashion

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:20,430
Colonel been pouting alexhuchet work on

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:25,640
the ASX generals level corner for three

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:29,039
years during last three years we have

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:37,140
five oceans else in a row stable Connor

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:42,629
this is sweetened three folding 318 341

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:47,940
and for volcano we bang party tents

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:52,079
features into elske those kernels were

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:58,770
widely use many different product let's

00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,379
include some of google nexus into a

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,670
station i'm going to talk about

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:11,299
something and maybe worsen the scoured

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:16,280
kind of fish by important let's include

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:19,310
why we do feature bang protein and then

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,580
before bang protein what kind of

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,689
operation we needed then go to the

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,009
feature organization which is best way

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:34,799
to organize your pocket or in feature

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:38,700
the most difficult scenes during the

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:43,110
bank party then is a conflict how to

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:48,270
conflict with proper with a proper

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,430
solution after bank holding finished you

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:56,790
still have a couple scenes this need to

00:01:50,430 --> 00:02:01,969
be done the funny we may talk a little

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,969
about the acceptation and the upstream

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,150
um

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:22,970
why we do been pouting and why we use

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:26,960
the old LTS in current computer world

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:30,560
kernel development is is kind of for

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,610
interesting and challenging many people

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,690
fighting the upstream but in the product

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:43,670
field lot of distributors and mobile

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:47,300
devices windows often shippers are kind

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:50,540
of old kernel which probably probably

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:58,610
based on one hour long term Sport sport

00:02:50,540 --> 00:03:01,790
Connor aka this is LTS so why to get a

00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:06,290
steady LTS instead of or ladies and

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:12,770
fancy upstream kernels they are due to a

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:17,240
couple reasons and as I list here the

00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:23,410
first one Austrian Colonel always hiding

00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:30,170
some bugs so the best devil Colonel a

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:35,930
scandal is kind of LG s colonel so for

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:39,590
product product Colonel then soon let's

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:44,209
let's will trade other system baseline

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:50,180
and for our Colonel pants and the system

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:55,820
ability so the last request should be on

00:03:50,180 --> 00:04:00,200
less regression testing required those

00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:05,050
are all require all target are steady

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,050
LTS instead of upstream colonel

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,800
you

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:23,460
if the product manager want to our LTS

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:30,860
colonel so they're often still still

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,860
couple the latest feature miss in LTS so

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,190
like some Our Lady's drywall's functions

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:41,639
or screw up data's here are some

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:47,360
examples in the air scare we do the bank

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:54,360
routing like some armed pci-e spot on

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:59,730
the ASX 41 and 318 another see group

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:07,590
right back also the hibernation on the

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:11,450
arm 64 not only about use the ladies

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:14,970
upswing feature they also some of the

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:19,890
tongue stream feature this is that

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:25,340
design for the arm big.little that is

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,340
EAS and HP hmp

00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:37,760
so is there any is there other solutions

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:42,470
if we own if we don't like this Bank

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:45,370
Paula team actually the recently is a

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,700
lot of argument in the colossal need

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:53,890
email email thread then sees a lot of

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:59,090
option guys insist we need to do the

00:05:53,890 --> 00:06:02,560
Austrian force in the product this is

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:06,850
not work this is a candle not true

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:11,060
because low so lots of features and

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:17,480
countries didn't stable in a product is

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:19,850
need more time to get steady the

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:24,440
afternoon colonel not very very stable

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:27,020
and if you do these kind of the upstream

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,390
forcing product maybe you need to keep

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:34,430
replacing your kernel follow the upswing

00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:40,130
let's will cause another problem is you

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:43,730
go low so can i pee I changes it may be

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:46,010
included drive API proxies but also some

00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:51,770
more important this is a monument

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:55,280
interface change bikes agree to so if if

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,050
you keep regret rebasing you know for

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,840
that lets will cause a loss whole

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,060
regression testing because you cannot

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,900
change a lot the interface change a lot

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,350
so not only the colonel part but also

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:13,910
some of the season level software that

00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:18,500
rely on many can i pee is both of them

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:23,530
don't need a fall testing this is kind

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,530
of unbearable for the mobile product

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,850
so a current solution is use the alt s

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:39,530
plus some of the feature bank routing

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:42,840
then she is used widely in the industry

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:45,930
not only the mobile devices but also

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:52,230
many distributors include some integrase

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:59,990
distributors here our example is ASX ASX

00:07:52,230 --> 00:08:05,160
used by many mobile devices when done so

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:10,860
designs are perfect solution the truly

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:12,900
answer is no there is allowed whole

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,550
redundant work and repeating the work

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:24,830
for the ordeen ever feature less n years

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:27,330
give these repeated work the second is

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:31,530
because the feature already enabled in

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:36,870
the upstream so if you bang potted fuel

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:41,390
to a OTS this your loss as well los Los

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,390
how review or testings from community

00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:51,540
the third one is when you to the been

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:55,830
pouting you often get troubles with some

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:59,160
new AP is less maybe you your feature

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:03,000
used in the upstream colonel also there

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,960
are also lots of color components are

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,350
cup holder closely so when you do the

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:15,950
pen holding you need to do a clear

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,950
decision on the carpod color component

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:32,920
so when we talking about with the bank

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:36,670
podium so if we have made in this

00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:40,260
incision also is not a very perfect

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:46,750
butter is it is commonly common used

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:49,810
widely in the industry so the first the

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:54,670
first operation steps is how to choice

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:57,160
is the best feature candidate and surely

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,149
there are some good resources to know

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,720
the feature request then see the request

00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:12,370
i'll give you a request who should know

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:15,940
a lot about this feature at least what

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:20,350
all this feature for and why we want to

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:23,589
use his feet this feature another

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:27,670
resource you can choose to get online

00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:34,149
and lots of information you only you can

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:44,519
get from LW in.net or you can search for

00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:44,519
wiki to see the pto feature profile so

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,769
during the future development there

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:57,370
usually are lots of oceans let's go to

00:10:50,769 --> 00:11:00,970
our screen or send to the lk lk ml the

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:04,180
first hearted and always busy last one

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:09,670
which is more into upstream but

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:13,899
sometimes the old official ocean is may

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:19,209
be acceptable if he uses the old colonel

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:21,690
api and without a functional or parking

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,690
Heisman

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,940
so after you design your future version

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:38,290
you need to collect the candidate commit

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:43,579
Yuri you can get direct feature Benison

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:47,930
pancetta from lk email for other related

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:52,579
commits a good way is to trick the

00:11:47,930 --> 00:12:01,790
colossal tree here is supervised to

00:11:52,579 --> 00:12:05,870
click related kameez in get a tree the

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:09,370
first line is you can choose from the

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:19,009
related kernel source file and the heat

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:26,750
here example is git log we won total

00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:30,290
upstream and after 2 dash there is a in

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:36,350
the directory of the source file so you

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:43,430
can get all the kinetic meets after this

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:46,720
command so another way is you can you

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:50,779
can chase this clean by the future name

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:58,069
so like the following to command git log

00:12:50,779 --> 00:13:03,500
I touch touch G or touch large group you

00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:08,709
can search the concern like a witch

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,709
commit mentioned the name I'll Kison

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:19,040
so then still another way Nancy's you

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:23,390
know who is the author of the author's

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:27,290
feature and so you can search by the

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:30,670
author name to see if any other left

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:36,640
feature commit less harm and mention

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:42,640
like cursor or mentioned something

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:47,149
that's maybe out of the source file so

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:53,750
anyway you can use all owners we kind of

00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:58,029
way and to to click the as well as the

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,029
post-punk meet you need to bang part

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:08,670
feature organization when you do the

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,180
bank routing maybe the a lot of feature

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:17,010
you need to the bank pot and maybe some

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:21,899
other cover the each other so your best

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:27,300
need are good organization the best

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:30,860
ruler for this is each or feature should

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:36,450
be isolated in a separate branch so

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:42,870
let's would make you branch much more

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:46,260
clear the obvious solution is you mix

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:49,500
everything together but this is a very

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,950
diverse ER if something wrong and you

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:58,880
need to retread maybe all of the Miss

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:58,880
fund difficult to debug or fix

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:07,970
there are as I just mentioned there are

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:10,430
still a lot of feature maybe a couple of

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:18,350
each answer or maybe a dependence the

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:25,070
other so for some dependency the feature

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:31,670
dependency the best way is you use you

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:35,870
use you use our another branch which is

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:42,040
based on the cupholder features not

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:44,839
basis in my line so the painful for them

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,710
the fourth line is our feature select

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:52,029
box also because our feature should we

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:57,080
are separated branch so you can choice

00:15:52,029 --> 00:16:02,750
any other features you want and to drop

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:06,140
any of them you dislike another way is

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:11,020
if you have a tree mod branch is clearly

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,020
is easy to read retrieve or debug

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,769
here example for the feature

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:29,120
organization we can see the health care

00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:36,509
for one this is release on the februari

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:39,449
in the 2016 that's this year and of HK

00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:46,470
is released monthly so the next lotion

00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:51,680
is March motion in the 2016 so we can

00:16:46,470 --> 00:17:00,440
see on the under top align the i/o TS

00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:03,810
ODS will be more into elske biweekly the

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:08,760
another line another middle line there

00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:15,750
are two features that is f OA and fo be

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:21,780
so here example sho fo a was directly

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:25,159
based on the LTS and ever will be is

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:32,370
home some dependency on everywhere so is

00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:35,790
better fao a naught Z LGS you can see

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:38,480
both of them are more into else can like

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,480
a tree model

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:55,190
bank pouting leads get a currency I

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,570
guess most of the open source repository

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:06,110
is based on gate so i just use get as an

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:09,440
example here we can see how to do the

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:12,110
bank holding the best command the base

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:17,330
call command is cherry-pick give

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:19,600
cherry-pick dash s dash x the here

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:24,550
example is a commuter one dot not

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:29,180
committed to this means to cherry-pick

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:37,100
pen set which is range from a computer

00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:40,100
one to commit a tool another way you can

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:45,040
do the bank routing also by the terrific

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,040
weather choice is a painter one by one

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:53,020
if you bring power to commit one by one

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:55,700
is easy to control for Eric amis but

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,470
actually I would like to throw the force

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:03,500
one to do the bank holding by the rent

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:08,300
so you need to get all commit in the

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:12,470
ones and then maybe clip discovered by

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:15,710
some dependency missing this means you

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:19,640
need to care more about dependency and

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:25,940
lots of rework for your fire bang party

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:28,910
but the good things is by this way you

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,120
you can make sure all the dependency

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:36,530
compete with are correct sequencing so

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:39,770
that's it good for oil for your final

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:43,780
work and to check to show the clearly

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,780
the dependency sequencing

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:54,809
so during the bank holding the most work

00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:57,909
and the key issue is to do is conflict

00:19:54,809 --> 00:20:00,820
the memories or conflict happens is

00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:04,809
there some are middle changes needs

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:09,340
between our base color and our target

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:13,679
feature so here I give a sweet hype

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:17,950
house for the change the mix conflict

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:24,039
the fall slower is the direct card-based

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:27,039
change like some remove the line in your

00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:31,929
patch that doesn't exist this was

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:35,529
changed by some commits so for this type

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:41,549
of you can use the command git log does

00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:47,470
plus h plus s orders g followed by the

00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:51,369
changes stream you can see which commit

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:55,240
to this change to look into the catalog

00:20:51,369 --> 00:21:01,659
to decide if lift meet you want or less

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:04,960
need does need to drop the second type

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:09,999
of for the conflict is there may be some

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:15,610
dependency missing like some new cut

00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:20,789
line adding to your core area and fall

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:24,669
fall for this for this conflict hyper

00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:30,929
you can find the change spicy key player

00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:30,929
black blame oh by the kid rock dodge p

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:42,480
so URL solution a euro result is you

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,480
need to pick up the dependency

00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:52,049
the last one is actually is the most

00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:55,190
difficult one your bank robbers feature

00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:59,600
cup holder is some other color component

00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:03,600
like what when I doing the bank protein

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,240
my twins been holding out yes lots of

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,840
scheduler features cup holder is a new

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:15,769
mass schedule that's that's very close

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:20,250
and is hard to figure out our elk meat

00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:23,130
so it became difficult decisions the

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,789
scheduler part also covered with color

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,980
memory so if you want to do the bank

00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:34,260
protein with other dependency that's

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:39,779
almost you need are everything so the

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:42,570
the better the better way is you better

00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:46,830
cut off earlier for the capital corner

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:49,200
conoco on it like on the arm

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,260
architecture we didn't need the Numa

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,649
scheduler so you can cut off from there

00:22:52,260 --> 00:23:03,029
and then you don't need goes to the

00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:08,179
kernel memory change so this is my

00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:08,179
station for the future cut out

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:23,179
there are some tools can be used for the

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:28,250
confliction maybe the colonel iiie Lance

00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:33,410
this is color get combined can we reuse

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:42,610
the conflict solution as your straighten

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:47,230
em and the second tools are usually used

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:50,330
to find the commutators trigger conflict

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:54,140
actually are actually I also mentioned

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:59,900
the answer is on the gate lock or get

00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:04,970
blame get rock has no soul param enters

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:09,429
as used to find out maybe everything in

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:15,289
your in the page so here I example

00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:21,470
example here is a good log 32 fan out

00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:27,830
the the screen in the task food and in

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:32,559
the inet time web socket and another

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:37,299
example is you can to blame all the

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:43,990
audio source file so you know I realign

00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:43,990
the history if Israel every line

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:56,820
so how to reduce is a conflict you're

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,670
lazy natural bank porting sequency is to

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:03,200
direct bank power the target feature

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:07,230
commit then you will find much on missed

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,680
commit need to refill the Miss kameez

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:15,030
often our dependency our dependency

00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:20,340
dependency chain then make my colossal

00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:23,280
conflict to reserve so if we can list

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:26,820
most of the password commits from your

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:32,220
brains Colonel to the target feature and

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:37,920
then pick up the enzymes direction let's

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:40,410
clear adduce much old conflict so um so

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:45,840
tricky is you need to know all the

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:50,070
relation commit actually I introduce

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,340
some some way to finality miss before

00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:58,830
like you get everything about you late

00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:05,880
committed by salsify also or by the

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:10,380
radiant stream so like the eyes are

00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,570
pencil in the middle middle place you

00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:17,280
may just need my awesome for the

00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:20,820
dependency so to avoid a conflict in

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:25,370
this code section so you need apply them

00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,370
all it's better

00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:41,830
the feature aots complexion actually the

00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:46,929
i guess is most look freaky freak

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:50,400
conflict I met Nancy is all I really

00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:55,540
example hand painted by where pampered

00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:01,590
the sea group like you can see on the

00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:08,950
upswing Knopf for one Israel more a

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:13,059
bugfix f1 the sum of the blog and memory

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:17,020
change machine based before the Fallen

00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:19,540
colonel so when Poisson model into our

00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:24,309
stream there are conflicting need to

00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:27,820
reserve and at the same time the sea

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:31,870
group feature also calls some complete

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:35,169
complete when body into upstream so

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:40,570
after everything after Eric conflict

00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:45,250
resolved in photokunna and then is keep

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:54,130
funding some barks fix f2 f3 in the same

00:27:45,250 --> 00:28:00,880
code area for see cool feature so the

00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:03,429
coma white reserves is complete is we do

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,440
the pen mode in direct based on the LTS

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:13,980
here we can see the the middle line is a

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:20,740
OTS line this is for one color and for

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:26,890
14 X and then goes to the last ones for

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:30,580
18 so on bugfix mix / clicks pick up in

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:34,660
the middle of a OTS but when we do the

00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:38,410
bank holding the last AOTS washing for

00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:41,690
18 so the euro way is to bank part in

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:49,159
the sequel Floyd bind future

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:52,850
a pc this means a arey arey see karate

00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:55,990
pine kameez need to do this need to a

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,990
conflict solution

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:16,800
so if you do if you do every conflict

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:20,000
solution for Erica meet Lance is real me

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:24,140
do the bank routing looks very ugly and

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,110
the difficulty to retrieve our parks

00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:32,510
what I used and I think Lisa is a better

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:36,270
way is we can directly bank party to the

00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:38,010
sequel drank bank as we can see the

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:43,140
committee a committee to build and see

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:47,100
the same as upstream so you can pack

00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:50,640
everything to the force for one color

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:55,560
and then the bug fix actually goes to

00:29:50,640 --> 00:30:02,070
the middle of the IOT is the bug fix f 1

00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:07,680
2 3 so finally the conflict the conflict

00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:11,880
still need to resolve but by this way

00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:15,390
you just need to do the to resolve the

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:22,590
conflict and the last mode so you just

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:26,400
fix all the conflict in one watch so

00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:30,770
let's make a smexy open party is more

00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,770
clear and trust fall

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:48,430
don't do I only went to the bank vault

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:52,090
in there is maybe some kind of taboo

00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:58,930
then she is a very bad for the product

00:30:52,090 --> 00:31:05,300
product stabilization like if you cannot

00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:09,740
do some change and the colonel API maybe

00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:14,540
canola user level or maybe internal

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:17,300
condom so if the internal color API

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:20,750
change like maybe some drywall APR

00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:25,610
changes necessary as well cause dance

00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:29,210
room drivers actually there is a real

00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:32,750
example above the canopy a change I in

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:38,000
this case I changed everything I change

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:41,140
I mean Erica no drywall the API is also

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,480
changed according to to fit the new one

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,970
but while all members report there are

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:55,550
lots of downstream drivers still use the

00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:57,770
old API that's called troubles not only

00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:06,740
the internal API but also some the

00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:09,710
colonel user level API like this cifs a

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:14,210
pro confess another example of this is

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:17,570
the C group when the civil with 110 to

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:23,120
see could be true and there is a big

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:29,850
software lets his named lab see group we

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:33,840
cannot uses a sequel veto so

00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:37,260
is a mineralogy they don't do rula this

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:43,289
is a don't pick out big carpet color

00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:48,419
color component as I just example of the

00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:52,650
EAS bang protein the Numa scheduler

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,690
should be cut off earlier or you go all

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:58,309
your family than see it's a long way to

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,309
do the Alpine pouting

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:11,010
after you finish the open party finally

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:19,960
so there some way you can do the reveal

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:24,460
of the bank water feature commit to

00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:28,830
compare it with the upswing colonel the

00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:38,430
gridlock dark cherry is used for tools

00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:42,340
to check this changed like this example

00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:46,600
you can compare the unchanged the

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:49,650
committee or is the app's upstream you

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:53,530
can see a vid chemist is piqued and

00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:57,400
which one is not in in your bank part in

00:33:53,530 --> 00:34:02,140
Colonel but this command is kind of just

00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:05,230
used for unchanging commit so if there

00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:08,560
are some conflict solution in your in

00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:15,429
your commit is commander where oh BTW

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:19,390
and show us two thousand pick up so you

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:28,630
still need some menu tools to 2gb to do

00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:30,909
the committee comparison the not only

00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:33,610
and you need to check our commitment

00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:39,010
also you you still need some testing for

00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:42,460
your features for the common colonel if

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:45,790
you'll need to do the euro the euro

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,940
testing like OTP tasting like a builder

00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:52,480
and booties in to see if anybody impact

00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:56,910
introduced for your Colonel for the

00:34:52,480 --> 00:35:00,480
specific feature you can seek the basic

00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:03,580
specific taste dimension from community

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:10,860
probably use kind of testing mention

00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:10,860
also published by the also to the lk lkl

00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:18,230
so if unlikely you didn't find the

00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:20,480
details the Testaments I also can send

00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:25,510
an email directly to the original author

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,510
to ask how to do the sparrow testing

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:37,820
well as we know the option colonel

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:41,420
zeenat may have a couple bugs on the

00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:44,150
newly entry introduced features so

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,890
that's the reason we don't like this is

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:49,940
one of the reason we don't like the

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:52,520
option color so when you finish the open

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:56,030
courting thence the same problem may

00:35:52,520 --> 00:36:02,690
comes to you this is a lot of new parks

00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:04,910
fixed in the upswing colonel so we need

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:08,450
to keep tracking the upstream and to see

00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:10,910
if any other bugs fixed and then you

00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:16,670
need to pick up with three our best

00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:20,650
color I also how scripted us can do the

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:24,850
odd mention checking to list all of the

00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:24,850
back Fisk commit

00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:33,570
so you can try you can try the script

00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,570
and to see

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,779
yeah I de cuisine

00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:54,580
okay we go to next sometime um I keep

00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:58,150
talking the current IP I cannot apia

00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:01,210
should not be changed but sometimes some

00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:08,740
of the features how to change his summer

00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:12,339
api's and maybe this is Intendant so if

00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:17,500
you do that you would way to notice all

00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:21,520
our users before some rice hunting like

00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:26,230
I introduced the case of the driver API

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:30,760
changed maybe someone requests from one

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:33,280
on members this is intended once in the

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,140
new API but maybe other the numbers

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:41,320
don't want that so if lance and hence

00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,480
you need to tell them what's happening

00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:48,099
and the world change and also give the

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,940
solution how to fit the new changes that

00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,940
is necessary

00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:03,660
expression expression to upstream

00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:06,799
actually there are recently there are

00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,900
lots of argument about the authoring

00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:16,969
forced on the feature and also the

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:16,969
upstream after enforced on the product I

00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:27,269
think the actually sings is is nearly no

00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:34,559
one know any product you are using

00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:37,349
authoring colonel so if we want if we

00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:40,109
want some requirement us or some

00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:45,420
ecstatic expectations for the upswing

00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:52,289
Colonel Leslie we want a photo are

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:57,119
always stable the second is should be

00:38:52,289 --> 00:39:02,400
goes to the app API changes so the less

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:07,549
I PR change the better and the API

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:10,829
changes may say they have some of these

00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:13,739
sterilization about the color API like a

00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:17,729
yo-yo season car we have a standard

00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:24,959
politics pasta standard but for others

00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:29,249
recently like us c group d am the member

00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:35,160
memory FD those scenes are always a

00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:40,289
widely used color API then she noticed

00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:43,440
and lies well so in the open source

00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:46,969
community there are some there's some

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,390
requirement on this generalization but

00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:55,799
because they are still marshal argument

00:39:50,390 --> 00:40:00,190
understand so this field is still need

00:39:55,799 --> 00:40:04,089
to improvement the

00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:07,510
another thing about the API is actually

00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:10,930
the secret way to is a kind of a good

00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:15,130
example here because when it was

00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:20,470
introduced the sequel one is mostly was

00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:23,490
keeped so if you'll somehow the season

00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:31,200
level software I use it would be one

00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:31,200
mostly is still is still usable so

00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:38,349
collaboration of bag holding actually

00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:43,089
there are there are links foundation

00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:49,750
project that's named aots I which is

00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:55,270
used for been pouting and we can check

00:40:49,750 --> 00:41:01,020
the LTS I the I guess my memory writes

00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:06,369
the ladies kenosha is still for three so

00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:10,690
each month the SK is too much better

00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:16,200
than LTS I and with two more bang for

00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:16,200
teens we use more ladies LG LTS

00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:27,300
but anyway is kind of collaboration is

00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:32,520
difficult in the open source since

00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:36,480
unload ology some was a very aggressive

00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:47,180
option guys keeping exists to do the

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:54,120
archery in product so and sees all so um

00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:59,720
what I introduce today is blue color is

00:41:54,120 --> 00:42:03,630
we recover from the important operation

00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:09,620
the feature polarization and then we

00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:13,710
talk about the conflicted solution the

00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:22,680
after you bang porting what you need to

00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:28,550
do finally the acceptation for the

00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:34,190
upstream so lengthy is all in my topic

00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:34,190
so any questions for the event party

00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,660
so one of the things in the later slides

00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,819
you were talking about was issues around

00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,099
standard api's with the mainline kernel

00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:52,900
and it made it seem almost like there

00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:55,539
were issues with regressions that you

00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:59,319
were saying between the api's upstream

00:42:55,539 --> 00:43:02,890
is that actually the case or so maybe I

00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:04,930
misunderstood that point sorry what here

00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,390
what hair cleansing about so I guess

00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:10,089
what the point you had about mem FD and

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:19,029
drm not being kind of a standard POSIX

00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:23,980
api api positive api what L mean I guess

00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:28,960
maybe I'm just confused I'm sorry our

00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:34,269
POSIX Pollux API yes policies widely

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:37,960
used the standard and the cincy is has a

00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:41,049
long history and it's a honda api is

00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:45,359
very stable but some others like c group

00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:45,359
all the chick

00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,850
what are these stabilisation

00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:10,740
out here like the I'm of the memory ft

00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:16,770
the lots of argument on this this new

00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:22,380
API is is candidly new so if if this new

00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:25,560
API s can also be standardized like the

00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:31,590
politics so dance all the people allows

00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:33,890
for the user level application so they

00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:38,790
give you your upgrade your Colonel

00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:42,830
software software you use that our

00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:42,830
software don't need to change them out

00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:49,110
okay I guess I'm not confuse with the

00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:51,860
new interfaces usually those shouldn't

00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,450
affect old applications because they're

00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:57,270
kind of parallel new interfaces right i

00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,770
mean is there a way that these newer

00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:04,320
interfaces are causing problems for

00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:08,520
existing applications your questions

00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:11,880
it's a new API you shouldn't how a bad

00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,940
impact on the on the option color is

00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,230
ends right yes I mean if you're moving

00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,470
to a newer kernel with an old

00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,150
application there's a fairly good

00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,640
promise that the colonel has the old

00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,960
api's won't break and I was these

00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,610
examples make it seem like they're

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,600
problematic but I am NOT are they

00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:33,570
actually problematic actually when we

00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:37,410
talk about the product you only is not

00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:41,130
only the colonel it's also included also

00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:44,370
the sister network South Wales so when I

00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:48,690
talk up in the here when we talk about

00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:52,320
the mobile industry the product you are

00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:55,710
is shifting to market maybe just few

00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:59,280
more few months so in those few miles if

00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:03,450
you need to change it everything like

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:06,330
you colonel your user level applications

00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:10,710
that's very faulty and that you can see

00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:14,040
in the mobile industry losshow user

00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:17,790
level API is is developed by others

00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,620
is as a wonder you can not control

00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:23,250
everything and it is impossible to

00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:28,350
upgrade all the user level API services

00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:32,160
in new uh yes you cannot upgrade all the

00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:42,240
software's with your API that's easy

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:48,980
give code ok ok thanks is there any more

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,980
question I can you wait a minute

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:08,410
you mentioned the year so many conflict

00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:13,730
when you find conflict to purporting to

00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:19,520
all the ideas and the as far as i know

00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:22,880
in LTS I committee when they found the

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:28,599
conflict went back PO to some petty as

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:35,890
an atheist revision I mean LTS precious

00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:41,650
LTS revision some when when the

00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:45,710
community member of LTS I find the

00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:52,180
conflict web backboard to obscene carnal

00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:56,440
to some regional LTS Connor in that time

00:47:52,180 --> 00:48:05,109
committee member where dsi intend to

00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:15,109
soul to contribute their result in to

00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:20,500
Absalom a color adds to solve conflict

00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:27,609
when backboard even it's the

00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:27,609
contributing so so how can I see sorry

00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:39,989
some some member with DSI is

00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:45,819
contributing to Absalom Connor to do to

00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:50,529
modify latest feature not to conflict on

00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:55,150
em it purport the FDA's Libyan do you

00:48:50,529 --> 00:49:00,009
have intend to those contribution

00:48:55,150 --> 00:49:02,410
activity you can see is some of the

00:49:00,009 --> 00:49:09,339
members has a contribution to resolve

00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:15,519
the LTS conflict on maybe LTS parks to

00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:23,099
pump out upstream yay yeah I this is

00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:23,099
maybe uh maybe related with this slide

00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:35,160
feature LTS complete and of course and

00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:38,829
if we find some bugs in the lgs we early

00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,769
we don't do the direct bank part we

00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:50,279
don't introduce the sparklies in our

00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:54,759
elske uncertain um actually we we often

00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:57,789
to introduce the spark phase two LTS

00:49:54,759 --> 00:50:03,119
forced and then we mod bank and two

00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:10,110
arrows k this is a bug fix our alts and

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:13,960
the confliction your easy

00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:18,580
dependable feature is asserted on the

00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:23,820
upstream force so this conflict it all

00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:29,470
happened on the LTS my example here is

00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:34,150
the LTS has a pet hair loss how the bug

00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:39,880
fix from upstream we can hear there are

00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:44,530
some bug fix f1 f2 f3 this was it that's

00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:49,060
what introduced to LTS for eggs actually

00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:53,800
this bug fix is also it's also or

00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:57,250
modified by by the contributor those

00:50:53,800 --> 00:51:01,090
zoos park fees is not exactly same as

00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:08,320
the upstream commit so the twosome

00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:10,900
already do some changes for alts is also

00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:14,850
