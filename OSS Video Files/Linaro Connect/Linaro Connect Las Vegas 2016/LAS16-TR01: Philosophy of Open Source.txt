	00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:15,839
alright let's get started I'm hoping

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,660
that this will be a really interactive

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,650
session so if you have questions at any

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,660
time feel free to raise your hand and

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,300
we'll get the question answered I will

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,330
repeat questions so that we have them

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,730
for the video and if you want to use a

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,140
mic there's also Mike to ask questions

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:41,250
as well so first of all I want to ask

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,719
how many of you have contributed to open

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:50,550
source before all right quite a number

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:54,210
of you cool so some of this content will

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:58,140
be pretty basic because I want to cover

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,300
all of the bases but also how many of

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:06,720
you would say that you're like a new

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:08,340
contributor to open source all right so

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,810
how many people have been doing it for

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:16,130
like a year or more okay why are you

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,840
guys here maybe are you are you

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,119
interested in like how you can get the

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,340
rest of your company involved maybe an

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,090
open source okay I think a lot of people

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,759
are interested in that as well so I'm

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,490
going to talk a little bit about the

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,380
philosophy of open source tips and

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,350
tricks for getting involved in open

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,900
source projects and give a lot of the

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,189
information that a lot of newcomers to

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:48,119
open sores don't necessarily pick up

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,490
right away and as I said I want this to

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,409
be a really interactive session please

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,280
raise your hand and we'll we'll get

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,369
questions answered so first of all I

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,799
want to talk about what open source

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:05,369
actually is before we get into how do I

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,420
contribute to it open source essentially

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:13,230
is a licensing model to be open source

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:16,319
you have to meet a particular set have

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,590
one of many open-source licenses the

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,489
Open Source Initiative defines a list of

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,950
licenses that are considered open-source

00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:28,800
some of those licenses have slightly

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:33,660
different terms so an open source we

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,769
have this concept of a permissive

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,530
license versus a copyleft license a

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:43,110
copyleft license wants you to give your

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,629
contributions back and the permissive

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,550
license says you can do with what you

00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,230
what you want if you want to give it

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,810
back that's great but you don't have to

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,970
I'm not going to get into a lot of the

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,220
details because each license is going to

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,980
be slightly different one of the things

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,890
to note is that you shouldn't you should

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,440
be very careful about mix mixing and

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,560
matching open source projects with

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,330
different licenses because some opens

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,680
not all open-source licenses are

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,269
compatible so it's very important to

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,700
talk with your your lawyers in your

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,739
company and understand which open-source

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,230
licenses are compatible with each other

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,180
and what your obligations under those

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,950
licenses are there are also other things

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,860
that are open source that are not just

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,230
code so for example there's the open

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,690
source hardware initiative where if a

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,810
board manufacturer wants to allow

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,159
someone to take their schematic and

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,159
modify it and then redistribute that

00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,430
schematic then you can license it under

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,290
an open source hardware license and so

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,750
you can check out the open source

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,209
hardware initiative for more information

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:59,040
about those sorts of licenses there's

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:02,610
also open source other open source

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,010
projects like documentation or works of

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,379
art and those are licensed under the

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,560
creative commons which is also a

00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:13,819
considered and open source license but

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,310
open source is more than just a license

00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:21,540
open source is about an international

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,780
community of developers that collaborate

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,370
together and so open source is about

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,100
sharing code and about

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:34,680
getting feedback and making the best

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:36,510
possible product that you can so a lot

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,210
of people when they first get involved

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:42,060
in open source they're concerned about

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,690
working in the public because everything

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,240
that open source developers do is in the

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,960
public and so a lot of people's concerns

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,479
are well what if people see the my code

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,550
and how and all the bugs in my code and

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,720
the mistakes I make because I have to go

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:04,229
and and interact on public public forums

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,510
public mailing lists often times people

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,930
are concerned with open source because

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,880
open sources also as often in

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,650
safety-critical systems so newcomers are

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,479
often worried about breaking things

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:20,340
there they're worried as well about

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,410
open-source maintainer zeeeee being

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,320
grumpy at them for breaking things or

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,350
for not getting their code perfect and

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,020
they're concerned as well especially if

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,910
you work with proprietary code a lot of

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,620
people are concerned about mixing open

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,020
source and proprietary code and

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,120
contaminating work code and so these are

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,190
some of the concerns that people have

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,229
when they're coming in to open source as

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:49,530
a newcomer but will address some of

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,570
those concerns in this talk a lot of the

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,940
concerns especially around legal

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,180
concerns you need to go talk with your

00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,440
own lawyers within your company and talk

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,960
with people who are versed in the art of

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,690
open source legal matters because I am

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,560
NOT a lawyer so that is my disclaimer

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,419
for this talk so when people think of

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,630
contributing to open sores the first

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,970
thing they often think of is code but

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,789
you can contribute a whole host of other

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,620
things to open source projects and these

00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:27,150
are all things that will get you

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:29,490
credibility and get you praise within an

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,160
open-source community so it's not just

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,620
codes you can submit bug reports you can

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,010
if you find a bug and you write a test

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,930
and you fix it and then you write a test

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,330
to find that bug again

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,560
you are giving valuable contributions to

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:49,259
a project even giving even the act of

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,020
being on a mailing list or being on an

00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,270
IRC channel and answering questions you

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,060
are still contributing to code so

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,889
there's a lot of people that say I'm not

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,900
a contributor to open source but they're

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,389
still sitting there answering questions

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,470
helping newcomers and this is a very

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:09,690
valuable thing to do there's there's

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,180
also things like writing documentation

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,310
writing blog posts doing tutorials these

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,889
are all ways to contribute to open

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:19,310
source that are often not recognized in

00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,020
our community that likes to focus on

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:31,080
technical aspects of technical code

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:34,560
contributions any questions so far we

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:38,820
can talk afterwards this is all that

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,270
would fit on the slide so for when

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:45,930
people start to get involved in open

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:49,380
source communities it's like walking

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,419
into your local coffee shop there's an

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,909
end your new there's a lot of

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,800
established relationships that you may

00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:58,260
or may not know about when you walk into

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,090
an open source community there's people

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,180
who have worked together for years and

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,220
they know how each other codes they they

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,070
can just say oh yeah and we'll do it

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,229
this way and they know immediately how

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,060
so when you walk into a new open source

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:14,599
community it's your job to kind of

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,099
figure out what those relationships are

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,630
there might be a whole bunch of people

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:21,150
from different backgrounds they might be

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,190
from different companies they may not be

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,009
paid to work on the code they may be

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,550
hobbyist or academics and so figuring

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:33,539
out how the community relationship

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,219
structure is very important a lot of the

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,310
times it's useful to note that there are

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:41,610
subgroups within open source projects so

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,469
within the Linux kernel you may have

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,510
different subsystems with different

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:47,820
people working on it some people might

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,730
be working on USB some people might be

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,340
working on the networking layer and so

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,320
you need to figure out who is working

00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,320
on what and sometimes there will be a

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,020
file called maintain errs or you'll be

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,600
able to look at the history from the

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,070
repo and figure out who is the

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,260
maintainer but it's very important to

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,630
identify who the key players are there

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,210
so that when you do start to contribute

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,000
or you do report a bug you know who to

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,950
listen to and maybe who doesn't know

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,170
what they're talking about or is maybe a

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:24,810
troll there are a whole bunch of

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,820
different community norms depending on

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,640
which open source community you work

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,940
with I'm going to talk give you a

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,450
general framework for how a lot of open

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,230
source communities work and then you'll

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:42,990
be able to find which tools the

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,690
communities using but until you sit

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,780
there on an open source community

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,180
mailing list and actually learn about

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,520
how the community collaborates you're

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,830
not going to be effective in working

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,020
with that community so there's a lot of

00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:01,260
lurking that needs to go on before you

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,200
actually get involved in an open source

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,750
community because a lot of the duck and

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:16,310
a lot of the community norms are not

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:18,330
going to be documented yes so there's

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,900
there's a couple different things you

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:26,790
can do and let's get into the next slide

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:29,010
and I'll like get into that so there's a

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,040
lot of different tools that open source

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:36,270
communities are going to use to

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,250
collaborate and this is the framework

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,230
for what you should look for whenever

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,360
you enter a new open source community

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,340
your first question when you enter an

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,680
open source community shouldn't be

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,500
where's the source code your first

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,900
question should be how do I collaborate

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,610
with this community how do I talk to the

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,820
people I need to talk to to get my work

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,700
done so every open source community is

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,670
going to have a place where they'll the

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,540
host their source code that maybe github

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,259
that might be self hosted

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,759
they may've and still be on sourceforge

00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,440
there will be some sort of website where

00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,139
you can you can actually download the

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,949
source code and then there will be some

00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:21,440
sort of way for people to answer short

00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:24,170
quick questions and these are the sorts

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,540
of questions like I am starting to go

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,579
through the installation process I've

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,769
run into this bug i have this error can

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:32,930
someone help me like these are the sort

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,089
of quick back and forth questions that

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,970
you want to be able to get answered and

00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:42,319
so all open source projects will have a

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:44,660
i wait a tool to do that it might be IRC

00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:47,589
which is Internet Relay Chat it might be

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,329
Jabbar it might be a forum discourse

00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:53,360
matters most but it's going to be some

00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:57,490
sort of tool where you get this quick

00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,279
back and forth quick back and forth and

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,810
then you'll also have tools where

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,970
there's going to be these long form

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,250
design discussions that might be a

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:11,420
mailing list you might be submitting

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:14,269
your contributions to Garrett or you may

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,740
have another way to contribute but I

00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:21,769
think when you're doing the lurking it's

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,810
very important to identify those two key

00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,750
areas because some people miss the to

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,910
some people will find the mailing list

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,160
and they'll see patches going back and

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,190
forth but because they don't look for

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,980
that that forum forum where they can

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,350
answer quick questions they miss half

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,160
the conversation so it's important to

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,680
lurk on both so if a project has both a

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,050
mailing list and an IRC channel beyond

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,089
both so that you can see what the

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,389
community norms are when someone

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:55,730
contributes like a small patch see who

00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:58,519
gives feedback and then you'll be able

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:02,329
to learn from them and figure out how to

00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:07,610
get how to do contributions better does

00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:10,459
that answer your question okay the other

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,639
things other types of tools that open

00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:15,399
source project uses a lot of open source

00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,990
project will use continuous integration

00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,070
to be able to test their code so this

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,460
might be

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:25,160
jenkins it might be another continuous

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,930
integration system but a lot of them

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,570
will have a set of tests that they want

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:33,080
you to run before you actually make your

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:35,900
contribution there will be a bug

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:42,410
tracking tool this might be bugzilla or

00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:44,600
launch pad or JIRA a whole track whole

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:48,470
bunch of other different open source

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,960
tools and documentation and it's

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,570
important to note that documentation is

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,510
often split into the official

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:59,090
documentation and then the unofficial

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,120
documentation so the documentation might

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,430
be a quick start guide it may be a

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,460
document that describes the features

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:11,690
that are involved but then you'll also

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:14,210
have a documentation that's maintained

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,760
by the developers that is usually a

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,750
little bit of that out of date might not

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,220
be organized very well but might have

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:26,540
the answer to your problems and those

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:29,660
are going to be like a wiki or maybe a

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,760
stack overflow forum these sorts of

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,230
things are so there's this official

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:39,140
documentation and unofficial

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:44,240
documentation any questions so far all

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:46,490
right so let's talk about some of the

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,860
different roles that are in an open

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:52,220
source community in an open source

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,560
community one of the key members you

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,780
need to look out for is a maintainer

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,410
sometimes they're also called a core

00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,610
contributor a code reviewer there's a

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,150
lot of different things but they are

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:07,160
someone in a position of authority

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,970
within the project and it's very useful

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,880
to you to know who is in a position of

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:17,060
authority and the project a maintainer

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,860
is kind of like a park ranger they

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,440
answer random questions from a lot of

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,430
people they clean up people's trash and

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:30,680
fix bugs and they also go and make sure

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:32,570
that their particular area is going to

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,020
be maintainable for a long time

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:39,230
so they're very interested in the

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,240
long-term health of the project so when

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,510
interacting with the maintainer and then

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,460
maintainer says I don't like this code I

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,400
want you to riorca tect it this way it's

00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,200
not that they have a personal problem

00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,680
with your code or that you're a bad

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,740
coder but they know that your code is

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,750
going to outlast your contributions to

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,060
that project especially when you're new

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,180
and they know that they're going to have

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,210
to maintain that code maybe four years

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,620
maybe not for money and so they want to

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,520
make sure that the best code possible

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:16,880
gets in and the reputation is on the

00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,500
line for each patch if you say hey I'm

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,910
going to submit this new feature and

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:25,940
they say oh well actually you didn't

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,590
address all these concerns I want to

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,960
make sure that the feature also includes

00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:34,400
you know this particular functionality

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,470
and you push and you say oh but I'll get

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,450
that done later let's just merge it now

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,640
and start testing it that's that's not

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,220
going to fly because the maintainer has

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:49,370
no guarantee that you are going to

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:51,560
actually stick around projects also have

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,510
multiple maintain errs sometimes there

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,630
are sub projects and sub maintain errs

00:16:53,510 --> 00:17:01,910
and so as I said you need to know the

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:03,920
structure of the project so let's talk a

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,079
little bit about your first contribution

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,459
and getting involved in the project and

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,380
getting on board one of the key problems

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,579
that I've seen from a lot of people that

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,030
i mentioned in the keynote this morning

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:20,089
is that people go and they write a whole

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,560
bunch of code off in a corner they don't

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,930
ask questions they don't communicate

00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,390
with the project and then they go and

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:30,230
submit this giant chunk of code to the

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:34,300
project so it's it's very hard because

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:37,160
when you do that the maintainer has no

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:40,010
trust in you you're a new member to the

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,450
project you've just dropped this GI

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,180
inching of code that they're going to

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,410
have to maintain and so it's important

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,790
that before you

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:51,710
start to submit your larger chunk of

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,230
contributions that you kind of work your

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:58,570
way up you know do a couple of bug

00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:02,060
reports make some small changes and

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,270
start very small start interacting with

00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:07,070
the community start asking questions

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,470
start being on IRC start doing code

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,810
review it's very important to get

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,000
integrated into the community before you

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:17,450
start giving those large chunks of code

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,700
back often when you jump into a new

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,130
project that's in a new area there's

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,130
going to be a whole bunch of vocab a

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:28,220
whole bunch of acronyms I myself I like

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,170
to keep a list of all of the terms that

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,330
I didn't understand when i first started

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,670
on an open source project i will

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:38,480
document where i found the answer to

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:40,820
what that was is and then i will often

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,920
try to give that back to the project

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,050
because if you're improving the

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,480
documentation for the next newcomer

00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:50,360
you're proving that you also have

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,180
learned things and so it's very useful

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,340
for establishing that trust relationship

00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:01,190
with the maintainer to do some

00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:02,660
documentation fixes and so I've been

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,550
talking about like how do you build

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,490
trust relationship with maintain errs

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,650
you can also do code review and

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,560
sometimes reviewing other people's code

00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:16,550
is really useful because you can start

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:19,840
to learn design patterns or what the

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:22,670
community expects even if you're not

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,190
giving you know big feedback you can ask

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,020
questions about other people's code that

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,630
they've submitted you know you can say

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,390
why did you do it this way where are you

00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,790
using this API instead of the API that

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,830
the documentation recommends and maybe

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,750
it turns out that the documentation is

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,330
old and then that's something you can do

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,930
to fix so there's a lot of different

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:47,900
ways that you can get involved but those

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:50,450
you know lurking on the mailing list

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,180
lurking in those those different

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:56,450
communication channels is very useful

00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,900
for learning community norms all right

00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,900
any questions

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:10,320
all right speaking of questions tips for

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,840
answering asking questions because when

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,550
you're a newcomer oftentimes you come

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,950
into an open source project and you're

00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,600
like I don't even know how to start I

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,240
don't I don't understand what they're

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,240
talking about and I don't even know

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,050
where to start asking questions and if

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,300
you go and you send a giant document to

00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,860
a maintainer and say I'm training answer

00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,250
all of these questions or I'm trying to

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,800
work on a project and I don't understand

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:41,310
how USB works if you ask these broad

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:44,760
generic questions the maintainer is not

00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:46,980
going to have time to respond but you

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,930
can kind of work around it with a social

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:55,500
hack so if you start to ask very precise

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:58,140
questions and if you document like where

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,890
you looked for the answers to those

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:05,960
questions then the maintainer knows that

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:09,000
you have done your homework right and

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:15,420
might actually be more inclined to

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,790
answer your questions but if you don't

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,350
document where you looked then they

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,660
might point you they might just say oh

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,240
point you to the documentation and then

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:31,080
you have to say well the documentation

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:34,350
doesn't actually cover my question all

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,470
right so tips for bug reporting I've

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:40,350
been a maintainer in the linux kernel i

00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:43,260
was a maintainer for about seven years

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,720
and as a maintainer there were a couple

00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,240
of pet peeves when people would report

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,840
bugs that were really really annoying to

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,450
me one of the things is that as a

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,960
maintainer you get a massive massive

00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,330
amount of email and so if you as a bug

00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,480
reporter don't figure out who to send

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,910
your bug to and you just send it to the

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,460
mailing list it's most likely going to

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,890
get lost so you need to do your research

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,690
and figure out who is the most

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,880
likely person to actually fix this bug

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,270
or answer my question and the same goes

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,100
for for asking questions always find the

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:23,270
person who is most likely to answer your

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:26,640
question and add them to the CC list or

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:31,770
at them on whatever forum software

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:36,740
you're using the other thing is when you

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:39,960
report a bug don't just say it's broken

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,110
please walk me through how it's broken

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,470
what did you expect what error messages

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:49,050
did you get was there anything odd about

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,610
your system installation please give me

00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,420
hardware information platform

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:56,400
information OS versions a lot of open

00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,860
source projects will have a list of

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,720
things you can provide when you're when

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,180
you're getting a bug some of them will

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,360
have a script that will gather all that

00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:09,510
information for you and you should be

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,340
able to provide that as something to the

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,340
maintainer for how to reproduce the bug

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,010
also don't report a bug and then go away

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,560
it is so frustrating as an open-source

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:24,690
maintainer for someone to report that

00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,550
they have a problem and you start

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:29,370
looking at the logs and and you need

00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,470
more information from them and then you

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:34,170
post information like hey I need you to

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,300
enable this debugging and then they

00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,940
never come back and you never know and

00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,920
sometimes you have a fix and you say oh

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,190
I think this will fix the problem but if

00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:47,120
the bug reporter doesn't actually come

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,680
back and say yes this fixed my problem

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,840
then I'm not going to merge that code

00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,590
because it's code that hasn't been

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,560
tested so don't report and then walk

00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:01,410
away if you have hardware that you need

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,810
to reproduce the particular problem

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,450
please hold on to it I hate it when

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,580
people say oh yeah that you know that

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,310
broken USB device I threw it away I

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:16,830
please just just hold on to it and keep

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:21,330
like the particular cables use so tips

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:23,570
for code review when I go and I submit

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,520
code to a project

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,900
often times it will be in several

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,770
different commits several different

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:34,880
patches and I will get a long list of

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:38,030
feedback based you know on each commit

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,730
or each patch and in that point what I

00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,980
do is I just make a little text file and

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,330
I just have notes on all of the

00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,970
different things that people have asked

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:50,480
me to change and then when i go and

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,360
resubmit my second version in my cover

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,980
letter or get pull request i will say

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,960
this version fixes list of things that

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,960
should be fixed and then the maintainer

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,970
zh that have had this mental list of you

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,710
have to fix this you have to fix this we

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,870
talked back and forth about this that's

00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,480
not really a problem they can look at

00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:14,570
that list and just go okay that looks

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,460
great and if you have patches or commits

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,520
that haven't changed between the two

00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,040
versions just say patches 9 through 12

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,560
or the same so that the maintainer hat

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,730
doesn't have to go back and review those

00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:32,450
patches that haven't changed if you

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,140
disagree with a feedback from a

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:38,750
maintainer back yourself up with facts

00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:41,330
because if a maintainer says this isn't

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:44,480
up to our coding style and you say your

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:47,390
coding style is stupid that's not going

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,240
to fly now if you're having a discussion

00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,160
and the maintainer says I think it would

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,570
be more efficient if we did it this way

00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,340
and you disagree say i think i think if

00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,960
we did it this way it would be more

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,170
efficient i'm thinking of these uses

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,270
cases and this particular data and then

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:09,440
me the maintainer says oh well that's

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:13,550
not a usage case that very many people

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,780
run into more people use it this way you

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,390
can have that back and forth

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:22,040
conversation about the feedback but only

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:25,460
if you provide facts the other important

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,890
thing to note about code review is that

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,650
and this is something that a lot of open

00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:33,620
source newcomers don't understand when

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:37,070
you submit code to a project you're

00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,530
trying to solve a problem you are not

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,430
trying

00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:43,190
to get your particular code into a

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:47,220
project you're trying to solve a problem

00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:49,440
so if someone has already been working

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,350
on this and they beat you to submitting

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,430
the patch that's fine because the

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:59,760
problem was solved if an architect says

00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:02,190
I need to you to rewrite this to be more

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,860
maintainable that's fine because

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,770
eventually the problem gets solved it's

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,590
not about getting your particular code

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,470
in so it's it's important to not be too

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:18,390
attached to your particular version of

00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:27,390
the code any any questions on code

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:31,710
review all right so there's a lot of

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:34,290
different signs for for finding

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,940
welcoming open source communities a lot

00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,400
of people get involved in open source

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,320
because their company needs them to work

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,910
on a particular open source project

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,020
because it's part of their business

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:50,480
strategy however if you want to just get

00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:52,950
involved an open source in general then

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,100
it's important to find a welcoming

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:57,330
project usually open a welcoming open

00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,460
source projects will have good

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:03,420
documentation they might have a code of

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:06,210
conduct so that there's not grumpy

00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:09,660
maintained errs that you run into and

00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:12,120
then they will also advertise their

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,150
communication channels if you find a

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,910
project where you can't find their

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,780
mailing lists or their IRC channels they

00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:24,120
may not actually want contributions back

00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,640
there's a lot of open source communities

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,560
where they just want to hack on things

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,090
they want to do their own thing but

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,190
there are also other open source

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,160
communities that are really all about

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,530
mentoring and they're really welcoming

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,570
to newcomers so there's a lot of

00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,040
different specific open source projects

00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:44,370
that i have in mind that are pretty

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:47,250
friendly for open source newcomers but

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:49,260
usually you can find those if you look

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,030
at the list of projects that participate

00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,270
either in

00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:56,430
the ricci internship program or the

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,830
google Summer of Code internship program

00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,890
because those are already programs where

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:04,260
there's mentors who are are dedicated to

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,210
getting newcomers involved in open

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,580
source and so it's better to look at

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,620
those lists and try to figure out what's

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:17,160
a good project to start getting involved

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:20,790
in open source all right so at this

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:26,220
point I'm out of slides there's a couple

00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:28,590
different things we could do one is let

00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:33,930
me see a show of hands how many are

00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:38,460
newcomers to open source contributing ok

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:42,150
cool so one thing we could do is go

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,130
through a particular project and find

00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,290
those communication channels that I

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,750
talked about and the other thing i could

00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:53,010
do is i can just answer any pressing

00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:56,700
general questions that people have so if

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:58,980
people have questions then please go for

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,060
it and and anything about open source

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,200
communities or getting involved or

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,790
philosophy of open source which i talked

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,380
a little bit about this morning are

00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,380
certainly on topic

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,020
thank you where would you go to get a

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,080
good example of a code of conduct if you

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,970
wanted to establish one for a community

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:34,100
so that the question was about code of

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:37,910
conduct and how to to find one for an

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:42,650
established community there is a page on

00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:45,260
the geek feminism wiki that gives

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:49,040
criteria for a good code of conduct and

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:51,970
what to look for but one particular

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:55,300
thing to note for code of conduct is

00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:59,780
that it's important you don't just have

00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:02,060
the code itself you have to have people

00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,530
to enforce it people who are going to

00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,090
answer questions and people who are

00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:10,820
trained to enforce your code of conduct

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,710
because if you just have your core open

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,570
source developers who are involved in

00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:17,840
code of conduct enforcement first of all

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:21,350
no one knows who is actually in charge

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,630
of dealing with code of conduct reports

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,580
and they also don't know how to handle

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,180
them and people may have differing views

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,460
on what is and is not a code of conduct

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,250
so when someone asked me a question

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:37,550
about what code of conduct should I use

00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,920
I usually tell them you should just come

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:42,620
to me we'll have a conversation that's

00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,780
as part of why I do diversity consulting

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,120
because I want to make sure that open

00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,870
source communities are more inclusive

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:58,280
and I'm happy to help you do training

00:31:50,870 --> 00:32:00,740
and find a good code of conduct so if

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:04,280
you have co-workers that you're trying

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:06,760
to get encouraged to participate as part

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:10,580
of their job say they're working on a

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,650
new network driver for example how can

00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,770
you facilitate them getting on the

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:17,330
mailing lists and you know you'd say

00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,410
gilma man listen again say okay and then

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,270
they just lurk there and never do

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:24,440
anything how do you how do you close the

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:26,860
gap right so the question was about how

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,280
do you get someone

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,200
being a lurker to actually contributing

00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,200
code especially if it's a co-worker I

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,059
mean it may be as simple as hey let's

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,030
sit down together and do like a small

00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:42,610
patch together and then we and then you

00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,470
and I can walk through how to submit it

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,420
upstream because I think once you get

00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,860
like that first patch in it's kind of

00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,160
like a little adrenaline shot you're

00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:54,820
like ooh I could do this especially if

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:58,270
you are already an established person in

00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:00,460
that community because you being CC on

00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:02,500
that and supporting the person is going

00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,440
to lend so much more credence to their

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,860
small contribution than if they just did

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,860
it on their own

00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:31,549
all right any more questions if not I'll

00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,890
go through a project for the the few

00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:36,380
newcomers that are in the room on how to

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:41,630
find those contribution channels oh

00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:43,010
there's a question in the back actually

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,720
it's just to follow up to the last

00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:48,020
question that was asked so one thing

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,549
that I found helpful for myself and

00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,980
getting other coworkers of mine and

00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:53,720
previous jobs comfortable contributing

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,299
to open source is to have some internal

00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,890
forum so that person doesn't feel like

00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:01,429
they have to go directly out to what

00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:02,960
they might feel as a scary community one

00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:06,110
job I have we had an internal mailing

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,679
list that people that were experts in

00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:12,109
that subsystem or whatever could review

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,820
things ahead of time give that person

00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:15,320
internal feedback that felt a lot more

00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:19,040
comfortable before they exposing them to

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,419
the rest of the community yeah it was it

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,330
was the same thing we had several

00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:26,419
internal mailing lists when i worked at

00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:29,290
intel that were for people who were new

00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:32,000
to contributing to the linux kernel and

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,589
oftentimes that meant that they went

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,649
through a whole bunch of code review

00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:38,240
before that went out but the thing is

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:40,099
that you have to remember is that the

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,810
open source community doesn't see that

00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:44,510
back and forth and doesn't see that code

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:47,149
review so then you go some newcomer

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:50,659
comes and submits a bunch of patches

00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:52,460
that have versioning information or they

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,230
have signed off by by people and the

00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,530
open source community doesn't see that

00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:00,140
so you have to be careful to also

00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,720
include the context that you got from

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,520
review on that mailing list when you

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,310
submit to the public like you have to go

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,500
and review your code with the newcomers

00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,570
eyes to figure out is this going to make

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,410
sense the community because we reviewed

00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,410
it internally

00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:34,579
so I'm just going to go back to that

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:37,339
list of community collaboration tools so

00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:40,400
for the newcomers in the room we're

00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:42,349
looking for source code we're looking

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,930
for a way to have answer a quick

00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:47,809
question where to have a design

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,299
discussion about contributions and then

00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:52,250
maybe continuous integration bug

00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:55,339
tracking and documentation so the

00:35:52,250 --> 00:36:00,880
example I'm going to use here is the

00:35:55,339 --> 00:36:00,880
Yocto project and the Yocto project

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:24,210
and the Yocto project so we're going to

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:27,700
first go and look and figure out where

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:30,820
they host their their source code so

00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,200
when I think of source code I'm really

00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,490
looking for like a link to their

00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,530
repository but to me downloads looks

00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:41,410
like somewhere maybe I could find the

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:45,480
source code so if you go to downloads

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:45,480
you'll see that you can actually find

00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:59,320
tar balls of the tar balls or you can

00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:02,230
find the git repository so the next

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,900
thing that we would be looking for would

00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:07,950
be a way to have short questions

00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:13,590
answered so let's try to find that on

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,590
the Yocto page

00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,710
my mouse is not working in case I don't

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,390
think we can go through all the examples

00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,340
but if you go to something like the

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,650
Yocto project with that list I gave you

00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:36,950
you'll be able to find things like their

00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,450
bug tracker the IRC the mailing list and

00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,490
so it's useful to have that particular

00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:43,970
list in mind when you're going to

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:51,470
projects all right any additional

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:57,920
questions you can just I'll repeat it if

00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:59,810
you don't want to wait for the wake I'm

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,340
interesting any kind of quick tips that

00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,540
you can do there's a phenomena with

00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,250
github projects where you could on

00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,540
github and you're done are there any

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,990
quick tips you can make you get a

00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:12,080
personal project more more appealing

00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,910
right so so with github yeah I think a

00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,530
lot of people think oh if we have a

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:17,060
project and we push it on github then

00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:20,690
everyone's going to come and it's going

00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:23,780
to be great tips for making github

00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:27,110
projects work you have to also reach

00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,000
people outside of github so it can't

00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:31,700
just be all interacting on github you

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,700
need to write blog posts about the

00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:37,760
particular project need to be on Stack

00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,830
Overflow asking answering questions you

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,740
need to have someone a bunch of people

00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:45,350
essentially promoting your project as

00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:47,300
for like what you can put on github to

00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,580
make it more appealing make sure you

00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,530
have a top-level read me that outlines

00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:54,200
you know how we're all your

00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:57,770
communication channels are how to get

00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:01,220
started contributing make sure that in

00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:04,220
your bug tracker which the github issue

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:08,000
trackers not that great but make sure to

00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:12,050
tag a bunch of newcomer friendly bugs so

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,420
small things that someone can do in like

00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,430
less than a day and get it submitted a

00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,260
lot of people especially maintain errs

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,910
that are overloaded they like to hold on

00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,220
to those things because those are the

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,680
things that they can do and still keep

00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,510
in touch with the code base but even

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,240
though it's going to take more work to

00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:32,900
get those up there it's going to

00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,470
actually engage your community more good

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,470
documentation

00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:42,829
yeah make sure your spot responsive to

00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:45,170
people i know there's a github project

00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:47,450
that one of my coat my one of the people

00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:50,420
i know maintains and like he's not able

00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:52,039
to get email notifications when people

00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,710
send in Paul requests it's very strange

00:39:52,039 --> 00:40:00,970
so sometimes make sure the github is not

00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:00,970
like losing your notifications thank you

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,360
see that's that's a question I get asked

00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:17,200
a lot but there's no definitive list of

00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:21,310
all of the open source projects there

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:27,400
are companies like black duck that go

00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:29,950
and scan projects for licensing but what

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,440
you could do for example is you could go

00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:34,810
on github and you could search for a

00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,580
particular license term and then you

00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,490
could find open source projects that

00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,190
have that license but there's no good

00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:44,020
list of here's all of the open source

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,780
projects and that's why I suggest if

00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:49,360
you're starting to get involved with

00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:53,770
open source go look at the list on

00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,620
google Summer of Code and outreach e to

00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:59,760
find a good project that's that it will

00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,760
be welcoming to newcomers

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:14,760
yeah there's we're all very disorganized

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,400
there's no like key organization because

00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,650
even there are several organizations

00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,030
that host projects there's like the

00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:28,170
Linux Foundation and the Apache

00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:30,450
foundation and the software freedom

00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,310
Conservancy they host a bunch of open

00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:36,950
source projects but no one's ever made a

00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:36,950
list of all the open source projects
