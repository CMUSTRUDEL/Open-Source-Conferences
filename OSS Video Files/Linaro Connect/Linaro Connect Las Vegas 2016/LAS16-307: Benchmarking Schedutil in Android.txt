	LAS16-307: Benchmarking Schedutil in Android
Speakers: Steve Muckle
Date: September 28, 2016

★ Session Description ★
Being able to see the performance and power impacts of changes in a real world environment such as Android is a prerequisite to doing meaningful development on scheduler-guided frequency (or many other sensitive subsystems). The first half of this session will review setting up the tools to automate testing for performance and power in Android. The second half will cover the results of using these tests to compare the schedutil and interactive governors.
