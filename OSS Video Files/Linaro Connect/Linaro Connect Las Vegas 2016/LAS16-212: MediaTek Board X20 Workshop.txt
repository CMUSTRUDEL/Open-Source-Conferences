attack latter days this follow nice digs

00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:26,689

nice league sport and with the backboard

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,899
it's awesome I can just run antutu

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:09,000
benchmark here but it will take about

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:11,980
five minutes later I will show that now

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:23,299
i will just run the antutu

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:27,549
ok this is a bill in morning I just on

00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:33,340
one time it can run a bunch of Mark is

00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:33,340
81 surrender I can test okay

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:45,920
this is a top wheel over the border it

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:49,220
as it follow a nice exporter so it's

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,470
higher infant interface as are a nice

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:59,600
little powder it's to get gig of memory

00:02:51,470 --> 00:03:04,370
and edgar map emj flash it now supported

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:08,180
one camera butter in the folder x20

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:12,170
supporter three camera and in next next

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:18,560
version we will do we just are talking

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:26,930
with 96 piano too maybe next version we

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:29,450
will support more camera this is the

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:34,580
poor the bottom wheel it has just

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:38,360
defined some function to switch for auto

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:41,660
border hdmi and USB host you can just

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,900
the typical or use the user holster to

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:49,580
use them the mouse or keyboard to debug

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:53,440
and we will leave one function one key

00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,440
you can just define it to sell yourself

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:06,860
this just shows environment when you

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:12,380
want to start use this pod a power

to hdmi or atrium 3g to TBI you can

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:40,240
grants the power to this and a micro USB

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:43,430

suitable is money for a trios it's a

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:05,680
else LCM model it can show the school

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:11,590
and help to camera and the user can you

and show the school

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:18,160
i just opened a camera application so

00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:29,490
you can check less this and we can take

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:29,490
a picture ok ok wait about this hill ok

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:44,920
how to create it okay it's very small so

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:49,720
this project are you just a LCD screen

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:53,040
you can just depend user monitor and

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:58,600
also also you maybe you can just define

00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:04,590
and a designer talk about yourself this

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:08,610
we just use a 16 high-speed interface

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:12,940
with me p the photo as just to talk that

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,970

step Isetta also the 96 pot watch

00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:52,920
for software development it's a chance

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:56,310
that as our 96 border you can build a

00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:01,050
yo-yo mandir a tall order under source

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:05,300
coder to the Ubuntu you Armand is easy

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:08,399
we have a guideline on our web a set I

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,760
just the install as I use windows so I

we have this this for you can just try

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:31,980
it for source code we have AOSP Linda

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:34,860
kernel and a mid tagger prepare a pin

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:41,209
array and we are just the updated

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,209
version to utilize the x 22 performance

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:55,560
it's just the beauty what a cigarette if

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:59,790

like this also it can't download from

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,570
the website o.o.h man and the 96 border

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:24,580
this is just the instil a petition I

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:28,180
figure I one know it we have four LED on

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:35,140
the border it just indicated some states

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:39,400
you can just define yourself so to check

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:46,330
out what were they to put okay all put

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:50,140
to wear also you can use a low speed up

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:55,350
in just two canals you add together the

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,350
information if the USB kind of work

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:07,610

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,930
on Android side to what what Colonel are

00:14:49,870 --> 00:15:01,720
using now caramel what kernel versions

00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:03,490
are using now 3.18 okay thank you just

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,660
to follow up to the same question you

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,800
don't have you don't have the Linux

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,089
right now but is there any plan anything

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:15,670
do you have any plan to provide your

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:19,689
linux for a do x 20 you mean the linux

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:22,180
kernel version yeah yes we have plan to

00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:25,689
support a new version but is under

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:29,019
pretty Nana and the undergoing so maybe

00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:30,939
we will released in next year join in

00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,550
this year because I will reduce the

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:36,699
three-point edging to align our product

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:40,240
so if you just as we mentioned in this

00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:43,000
morning main station we just want to

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,959
help the open open community to have a

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,779
way to realize your ideal product into a

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,990
real commercial program so the best way

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:55,269
to help you is align our production the

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,370
linux kernel version with the solver

00:15:55,269 --> 00:16:00,550
opens away but in the future we will

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:04,980
have a plan to support maybe 4.4 or

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,980
other enjoy version or kernel version

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:15,519
about to do the board to yours right

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:19,240
include her what's going to our wave no

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,870
jewelry included okay about a total more

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,470
my total port right now we are talking

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,170
with agile mind to develop to provide a

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:32,730
display and to camera and I've macho

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:36,160
then for our photo sport is under

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:38,559
developing so the best timing is well p

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,899
already in the end of this year but

00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,990
maybe even if they need this and

00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:46,509
everything is called smooth then should

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,689
be really see me and abs easier but if

00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:52,860
we have something I need to fix but we

00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,860
will will be a little late

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,860
it's the source code for the flashing

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:18,610
tool available refreshed or just

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:22,600
refreshed or sorry so you need other

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:24,550
source code up refreshed or now it would

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,740
always be preferable because sometimes

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,180
we do stuff like flash one bought from

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,850
another boat and you probably don't

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:36,550
provide unbind really flattered okay so

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:38,680
we have released our fridge to to our

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,830
classmate retro we didn't release the

00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,950
source code to the open community but we

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:52,180
can consider up about it okay that would

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:54,120
be great things following about the

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,280
flashing tool do you consider our

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,640
releasing the talks about the protocol

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,400
of the tool because the tool is like the

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,830
main goal of the tool is basically to

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,580
partition the board and to turn it into

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:13,090
the fastboot mode so as I checked I had

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,670
access to a source code so it it can be

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,500

00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,580
