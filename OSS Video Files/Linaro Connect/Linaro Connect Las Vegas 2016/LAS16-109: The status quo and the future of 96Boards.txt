	00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,980
so hello everyone my name is young if

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:26,609
you don't know me already and running

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:28,769
man EP quotes within an hour so I'm

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,480
gonna run so that's very quick today I'm

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,719
want to leave me enough time for

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:39,090
questions and you have in the end so

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:41,370
yeah the title this presentation is

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,590
called state as cold as was and in the

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,920
future of ninety six boats it's a very

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:52,530
big topic but I don't intend to cover it

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,539
all I try a weird try so about a year

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,469
ago where you know we first started

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,320
managing school initiative one of the

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,220
question I got asked a lot more actually

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,530
not a lot every time and someone came to

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,369
come to me is you know why do you guys

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,890
do this at all it's a tons of a sink SBC

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,189
out there I mean are you guys mad to eat

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,520
reinvent the wheel right and of course

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,080
at that point we only got one boat and

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,990
we have the designer sit in the House

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,909
today which lures King and from hong

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:33,900
kong so off about 12 months down the

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,700
line where we are now and after all the

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,189
hard work has gone through it with

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,880
ninety six boats so unfortunately people

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,100
are right we are mad just a slightly

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,729
different way because today we are

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,310
seeing the number of you know the level

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,430
of participation and the number of the

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,009
community partners and the number of

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,820
SLC's has been enabled online is

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,649
exported I think it's phenomenal so I'm

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,630
going to I'm going to actually quickly

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,740
take you through a short evolving

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,879
journey on well wasting than six boys

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,120
today and what we think we should go

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,730
next and actually also be making some

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,489
allowance

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,409
new board camera option is some of them

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,420
already been ruined by George in his

00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,190
keynote today because today he always

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,440
been the argument right so we were

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,860
talking about whose whose whose life to

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,239
put he won't of clothes so but that's

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:35,680
the more boards which we will talk about

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:40,599
in detail today so what's 96 boat you

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,989
should see these koi put points in this

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,840
life that we present in front a warm and

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:50,140
slightly correction on the English side

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,840
obviously my bed and butlers should stay

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,780
the same so it is a recognized 96 armed

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,450
with 78 open specification I think that

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,910
is fair statement today if we can't say

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,940
that 12 months ago I think it's a fair

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,769
statement today it is the owning as also

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,799
independent specification which we are

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:11,799
we have created with the contribution

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,870
the cooperation with members and is a

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,629
low-cost rapid prototyping product if

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,639
I'm platform I'm going to spend a lot of

00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,169
time on this point later on and it's

00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,970
been tailored for different segments

00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:27,489
requirements so audio stuff but what do

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,010
we actually mean by that what do we

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,690
actually mean by that so does this look

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,250
familiar for any of you who will be

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,750
working on the product side won't let

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,269
you design something which you think are

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,519
pretty cool to implement application

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,430
ideas you have and you want to bring out

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,120
actually in productivity able to sell it

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:49,480
so this is actually I will think about

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,730
how to create this you know slice then

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,160
what I did I just quickly search as pc

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,849
in google this is what came up with your

00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,060
first page of many so which ones you

00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,560
reach we choose we're talking about if

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,000
you are application developer you are

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,169
product design you want to build a

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,810
product you want to be able to

00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:14,290
differentiate in area where you are good

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:18,039
as what do you do so the question

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,979
actually normally is I you know for what

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:23,789
we understood is unanswered riddle it

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:27,400
because to be able to evaluate

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:29,740
multiple this multiple different slc to

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,050
be able to evaluate even multiple

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,080
sources on the same production roadmap

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,720
is impossible even if the evaluation

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,630
cost is so high is to point be

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,120
prohibitive for production designer to

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,250
be able to even considering changing

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,280
platform so it's very much you saw a lot

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,810
of product products were very dependent

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,090
which is actually not necessary bad

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,400
thing but it does not enable them to

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,380
differentiate himself in era where they

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,599
are good at in fact in the long term we

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:05,650
would argue is not a healthy situation

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:07,900
for the soc Wendell either so I stole

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,430
I'm from Barry Schwartz and in the book

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,789
are pretty are like a very much present

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,500
laser products of Troy so choosing were

00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:18,300
especially difficult for those who

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,979
determine only the best which

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:28,270
unfortunately many of us fall into that

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:32,470
category so we sell 96 photos of our SOC

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:35,260
independence and one noticing which we

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,110
are seeing today is all this bull you

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,669
can see here public availability are all

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,889
sorts of different nose of the vendors

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:43,889
and in fact it collect them

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,770
I'll be announcing so nice table

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,020
starting from a specification or status

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,800
application so this was the landscape

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:02,790
which we set out to do to a month ago

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,180
and i'm happy to report that at this

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:08,639
point we have specification landscape

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,729
created for both consumer and you

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,370
Enterprise Edition as wise the Georgia

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,410
announced the publication of IOT edition

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,040
which is available on Isis bog website

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,990
also we have 96 bought TV platform

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,690
addendum on top of our enterprise

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,450
supporting the digital home and as TB

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,630
market there is a specification 9sx poor

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,919
network edition is in the walk put the

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,470
wrong distinguish i will mention later

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,710
that is one of the most exciting area

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,900
actually we see in the next phase of

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:45,330
development and a multi-tier of

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:51,180
networking edition of the device so a

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:55,229
lot of boards now what we believe there

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:59,010
is a beauty in singularity not in the

00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:00,750
sense of single slc a single board but

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,599
in the sense of where we can find a

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,389
common ground across different on based

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,410
SLC's we can find a common ground across

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,930
different solutions and that's what we

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,000
need we believe 96 board comes in that's

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,370
the singularity we're looking at we

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,099
believe how in our graduates actually to

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,160
be able to foster competition healthy

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:25,979
competition and in areas where they

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,590
matters in the slc differentiation in

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:34,080
actual application of application level

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:37,139
differentiation so Matheny's right so we

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,150
have the boat and remember we have the

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,460
we are near powerful latest and greatest

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,500
is also it acknowledged in some of the

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,050
most horrifying video I've been taken

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,960
this morning we talked about the new

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,520
board but we are looking at a single

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,470
community for all the board all the

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,590
stats we have been you know been working

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,830
on so we are creating to create a single

00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,140
community with a sherry

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,410
solutions across different book there's

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:05,560
a sound very good example here some of

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:08,890
the some of the madness developed by one

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,630
of our partners which were designed

00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,480
according to one man is exposed

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,900
specifically mind we brought it to last

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,340
connect and plucking to another complete

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,620
difference of the vendors many things

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,880
border and you know what I just walk it

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:27,880
just worked to us that obviously is a

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,150
very very nice message you see we

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,790
believe to the feasibility over creating

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:37,510
that single community is good it's good

00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:39,400
for us all and of course single

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,960
community is not just about creating the

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,790
extension poor to materialize

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,200
application ideas you have it's also

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:48,190
about the software of course it's about

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,750
soft well I think most of us here are

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:54,310
you know how software engineering

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:57,280
backgrounds so these are a capture or

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:59,800
what currently to our best to our

00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,830
knowledge in terms of provision system

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,440
and has been already supported on 96

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:09,070
port and I can produce sure to say

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,830
that's a lot more I haven't captured it

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:15,160
across a lot of different across a lot

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:17,230
of different application domain I think

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,380
the dcd is just go get growing front and

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,410
bigger and bigger time the casing

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:26,700
remember here is we didn't do this

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,690
voluntarily some of them in some of the

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,520
some of some of you actually who

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,990
designed the both who ordered no owner

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,630
of the manufacture of the folded knows

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,000
those doesn't come from you the

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,520
community did it for you you get your

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,170
boat out someone down the line didn't

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,750
even know just tell you hey you know

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,630
what I've got this portal on your balls

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,700
do you want to give it a try I mean not

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,070
something we were looking at is we

00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,510
believe the cross popular polarization

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,850
we believe that your community has a

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,070
capacity and capability willingness to

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,650
help to develop a solution which you are

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,210
the wise will be quite in terms of

00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,340
course until the time for him in terms

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,040
of your ever-growing to-do list on your

00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,139
organizer

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,449
in charge so we believe this is actually

00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:11,149
very very nice and neat way of getting

00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:16,610
your SOC technology accessible to those

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:18,380
who otherwise couldn't I don't think we

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,769
have ever shown these slides of

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:26,149
previously because we couldn't do we had

00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:29,029
two and two or months ago now we have

00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:31,009
leased so we have a lot of new members

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,649
who has joined an experiment committee

00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:36,769
what worth noting is every single one of

00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:39,790
them has been very actively in in terms

00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:44,720
of enable there's slc out in different

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:47,660
96 bored and also we believe that so to

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,519
have a healthy program we need to be

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,009
able to have a healthy student committee

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,430
and also partnership so that's why we

00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:57,079
also have been making a very big push in

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,680
terms of establishes the transversely

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:03,110
and you know the partners will be able

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,190
to provide that service to our associate

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,870
vendors so here the complete actually we

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,120
have a new one just been signed up

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,860
yesterday but these are the ladies with

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,819
the least our partners we have yet today

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,560
look at you know we talking about

00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:20,779
community engagement don't forget 96

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,329
ball was only launched about year and

00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:26,660
half ago the first specification and we

00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:28,279
actually really a palooka was starting

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,720
point to what we are now I think the

00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:36,589
gross it is quite clear it has the wall

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,260
of the scene we see is there are we did

00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,029
have a bumpy starting points from well

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,370
we have the design in terms of getting

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:46,069
the boat to the designers hand I think

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,920
we have now getting better and better at

00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:49,970
that and what the interesting thing if

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,319
you do actually looking at the data

00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,300
which you also you have the access to

00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:56,480
the slide later you were seeing the

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:59,120
original adoption and across a time

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,069
frame you know we're actually which

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,870
region has adopting the managing board

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:04,850
on how the traffic it grows in different

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:09,819
regions very interesting we are seeing

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,819
region outside US which was the pig

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,610
so like to actually just respect cups

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,000
technology so we have photos who doesn't

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,640
know we have a 96 port open house and

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,279
which is a real-time online session

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,930
where everyone can get access to many of

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:32,339
them or many of you are probably already

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:34,320
have a well all your questions technical

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,959
questions supplier questions your mojo

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,690
questions get answered by people from an

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,640
easy sport team cost and also other

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,589
teams of coaster dinara who are the

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,510
audience the use of 19 support as well

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:47,580
as a partners and the actual laurens

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,730
king himself has been presenting couple

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,100
session which were quite sensible to so

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,580
please feel free you know sentimental

00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:00,000
help us spread message if you could get

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,500
your questions on you know I hope that

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
most of question you will get answered

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:09,350
in that for real and yes that's actually

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,589
something we are doing committee that we

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:19,800
chose the app okay so run for the 10 15

00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:21,300
minutes no what's new as I said some of

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,500
them already been spoiled I can't help

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,060
but for those who hasn't been sports now

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,790
this one some of the you probably know

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,420
this is actually first 90 simple see

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:37,339
extended board down by arrow incomes are

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:41,399
in conjunction with in for cheap but

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:44,190
Coco using coke home chip so Snapdragon

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,230
600 I'm not on the race of this back

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,170
because quite honestly I'm sick of all

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,180
this bag because so many balls and just

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,000
so many balls really about the one of

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,730
the important thing is to notice is that

00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,709
we if you look at very close of those

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,730
pores we are seeing at the boat between

00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,589
portable there's a lot of

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,600
differentiation starting to come up as

00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,270
it's very interested because from those

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,209
differentiation you can kind of see well

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,880
this ball can go why is going to and you

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,890
know so so those area actually very very

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,420
interesting that's what we want to see

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,670
too will the pics back was creating the

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,000
beginning because this bag is net has

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,420
never

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,610
being worn our intended to be limitation

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:30,180
and the constraint is all about actually

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,890
doing what everybody has to do but let

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,000
everybody else are in the completely in

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:38,010
the errors really matters so that the

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,300
board which is the first actually to

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:44,900
page 90 people see extended port and

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:50,190
today we're also announcing the first

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:51,810
test scores 96 port from as T micro well

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,180
in fact this doesn't count because

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,610
Georgia is now the carbon which kind of

00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,840
boys is one as well but this is a

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,000
co-founder Steve micro 90 suppose

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,180
extended ball two I want the interesting

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,240
about this board is done this is after

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:13,080
high key this is the second book which

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,090
has specific target for nannies export

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,130
consumer reference platform and

00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,810
qualified hardware which means

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,420
everything about this ball will be AB

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,280
stream from day one which we know will

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,670
be quite welcome in southern part of

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,530
community so it's got SATA connector

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:33,390
I'll kick about interface this board

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,550
samples has really been sampled at the

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,330
league and so we should be able to see

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:41,430
this board in the in the areas role you

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:46,770
know the SOC bundle has interesting very

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:48,930
soon this sport of course not stranger

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,640
to many of us and I believe we have a

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,170
dedicated session tomorrow from media

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,480
tech I talked about this boarding in

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,540
detail but we're very excited about this

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,070
pose for media tag as you know as well

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,280
we keep repeating ourselves that there's

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,650
a tackle core arm cortex a codex a 64

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:10,200
and with good tomorrow very good Molly

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:11,880
and eighty GPU waltzing would I like

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,710
just all scorers us one thing without

00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,060
you know we didn't George didn't mention

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,480
his slides they actually got crypto inch

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,370
extension in able to which you know we

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,630
know it's very very you know quite a lot

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,290
of community as part of interesting

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,180
especially those one working security

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,860
what interesting would I ask everybody

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,889
look out for it's not about the main

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,019
board itself it's actually what we come

00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:37,759
with it and of course I'm not going to

00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:40,209
spoil her what what what what arch of my

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,440
name TK has in mind but what I said

00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:44,180
wheezing this board has really

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,860
interesting use case and some of them

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,230
which are through design different

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,910
solutions different madalena's answer so

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,500
I think which is a really powerful board

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,269
that has a very very good development

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,560
path to become a really fast prototyping

00:16:53,269 --> 00:17:00,949
productive and platform this one's

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,259
totally spoiled and stays carbon first

00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:05,179
964 out he boards this is actually out

00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:09,650
design in conjunction with our

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:11,419
manufacture partner seat so we have been

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,799
working intensely including the last

00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:15,319
demo which George has demonstrated

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,730
earlier so I'm not going to spend too

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,699
much time on this because we recently

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,520
enough you can get a bowl if you haven't

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,520
already done so and today we hope that

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,850
will be generating some very interesting

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:32,540
government or discussion in my ass so

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:36,080
this is first 96 priorities but by no

00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,510
means the last because there is actually

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,150
another 16 boards which I will not

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,620
announce today but it should be you

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,690
should be able to able to find it very

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:48,710
soon well actually see more and more

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:51,080
designs obviously next being spoiled 110

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,480
less than 10 door contacts 896 priority

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,409
would be actually a perfect fit for the

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,120
entry-level gateway device some of you

00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:04,790
will probably hear more about this board

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:07,549
later this week so this one is also from

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:12,200
orange pie and the people behind orange

00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:14,270
pencil this board I have abdomen rich

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,159
there is a very poor performance in some

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,970
play in the game and today this morning

00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:21,860
so don't own Spanish a time this also we

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,799
announce them mstars carbon an easy

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,130
sports and yeah I think one of the point

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,870
which Mycoskie already mentioned is you

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:34,280
can see differentiation on this poll as

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:37,740
well and we're really looking at what is

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,200
you know applicable what is important

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,390
for that segment for the stb market and

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,790
this board obviously it got em starts

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,070
very good capabilities episode yay the

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,360
streaming of full content behind it we

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,150
believe this product could be very

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:56,040
excited in that field as well as well as

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:59,040
poplar so I rolled through some of the

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,640
new boards which you have seen so what's

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:06,660
next I told you already that some of you

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,000
right there are 30 plus board including

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,570
the ones we all nounced already in the

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,970
world and some will write very soon so

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:18,360
we are seeing all these different type

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:22,140
of SLC's ab enabling analysis moon form

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,980
factor what we think next would happen

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,410
is we're going to make good use of this

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,600
board we're going to help the community

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,820
help you how they saw you and help our

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,980
partner to achieve what you have set up

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:40,530
to do in this program so of course more

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,179
boards so those two boys someone you

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,100
probably have already seen in different

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,990
convention awarded interesting about

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:50,910
those two boards obviously that the

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:52,620
first one is a adhira slightly twist

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:56,250
there because it's part of a really in

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,500
jail right so we were supposed to talk

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,360
about Peter know about arm but it's

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,350
nevertheless very interesting very

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,760
powerful as I see and the use case of

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,950
this board is actually particularly

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,780
interested in a security side if you

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,809
look at the carrier of this body sir is

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:16,260
the company cause the QRF in conjunction

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:19,020
with arrow and the next one which

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,910
english p features nxpi mx7 nicest ball

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,250
was of course this board was announced a

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,050
year ago and i think the final resolve

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,820
the issues which preventing it coming to

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:32,220
the mass market so it should be

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:35,010
available very soon so this is obstacles

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,440
back the old drawing we had in this bag

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,440
and how easy it is actually really

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,150
you might be familiar but that's a

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:51,510
possibility I could finance industry so

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,160
it's very easy really we we seen the we

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,230
see in the Far teach the design of the

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,900
board receiver from the clown families

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,060
to actual board come out ahead two

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,800
months time frontpoint aware we starting

00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,900
talking to actor Paul forget so it's

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:11,100
very easy to enable ssl on my facebook

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:13,020
and why does he really matter so we are

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,970
we are wearing today now we have a

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,030
three-bay specification we complete it

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,120
and outta specification consumer a

00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,880
specification and enterprise wouldn't it

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,130
be nice in the first picture I showed

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,040
you if you remember they have so many

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,870
imposed me too you have so many boards

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,270
to choose from all different way

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,600
different different focus most of them

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:41,850
are appropriate so will it be nice to

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:44,580
have a board which enable the latest and

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,500
greatest in technology and wouldn't be

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,910
nice to have a past proton ization I

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,220
know people keep bringing up the topic

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,890
in terms 96 both comparison in terms of

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,950
Raspberry Pi although I keep keep in the

00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,290
same answer saying it was never the

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,780
intention it has never been our goal to

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,540
compete with raspberry part because it

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,220
was not a competition it's a house

00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,990
different market needs United States

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,630
boys not there to replace Raspberry Pi

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,270
and it was not the intention is th not

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,570
Center day but look at what you could do

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:18,330
you can derive very cool stuff we had it

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:21,420
very closed up with raspberry pi but

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,970
there is no production ization path you

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:29,940
cannot build a product where the chip

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:31,470
which you three pi slowly and lost thing

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,150
you can't do that I'm just saying you

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,010
can there's no path for you to actually

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:39,120
utilize the chip in the way which you

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:41,670
want so that's actually quite quite key

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,590
and the weald really would be nice for

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,450
developer naval have an awesome user

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,010
experience I mean that's some solution

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,800
you will see we would like to get better

00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:51,130
as

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,770
and would it be nice to have a direct

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:57,040
generic platform which enables rapid

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,600
perform dramas we're talking about so we

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,360
see one of the training which in this

00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,460
market is that the time to market really

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,520
has put a lot of a pleasure in terms of

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,650
the design house or the product designer

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,250
choosing evaluated the product you won't

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:15,070
the platform you want to use and because

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,990
of that pressure and conflicting with

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,230
the week with the fact i just mentioned

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:22,960
the cost of evaluation is so high i put

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,550
us a reading a dilemma i think which

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,250
none is explore offer actually pretty

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,710
good answer there is a platform which

00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,290
allows you to be able to evaluate a

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,810
platform in a way which is generic

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:38,200
because all those balls has the same

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:41,740
interface at the generic level where you

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,400
can deploy sorry you can't evaluate your

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:48,340
product to design prototype very very

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,600
quick yeah i mentioned these people we

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,610
would like to standardization a

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,060
standardized where everybody has to read

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,620
vance to read minds and of course this

00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,510
is quite important i believe that's the

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,100
reason why manning of the soc Wendell's

00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,510
participate the program is be able to

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,400
take advantage of the narrow as its

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,410
members collab to render doing outputs i

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:11,290
think we are seeing that a very clearly

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:13,840
and in the hg case to this morning so

00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:16,800
low cost obviously that what i would say

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,720
is the tube before 96 poor came about

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,600
there is i think it's probably safe to

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,690
say there's no otology for low cost and

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,630
v8 platform it just just now you go to

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,400
choice you either by armed Juno which is

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,700
quite platform by expensive and how to

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,490
get all do your own thing which always

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:41,770
has been considered to be quite

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,510
expensive and of course a wide

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:48,670
distribution or support because as I

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:51,100
said we believe it should be OS agnostic

00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:53,320
for good platform for you should you

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,210
should shouldn't be limited in terms of

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,880
the choice of protein system they should

00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,680
three team in era where we matters in

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,580
terms of vacation is needs

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,830
and so last but not least the upstream

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:09,730
support as assets in the next slide you

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:12,880
will see we are going to straight 19

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:15,490
sports which is one of the major change

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,180
I want to mention today is two different

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,830
group 1 group is community board well we

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,500
are not going to stress too much in

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,830
terms of the optimal comment which well

00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:30,970
well we believed actually more focus on

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:33,220
the protagonist and would help and the

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:36,100
second group is those ones would really

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:42,010
benefit from always close to tip and

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:45,010
mainline upstream focus so the I did say

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:47,440
that the future about 19 sports that's a

00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,420
lot since we wanted you and you know

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,610
there's a lot of things we think we

00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,830
could do in fact that we think we can do

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,870
em is really but there's only seen only

00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,630
incidences we can cover but we would

00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,890
like to be able to cover these grounds

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,140
first of all we would like to improve

00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:04,030
the cross poured out of box acute

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,550
experience that means working with our

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:10,660
partners and members to be able to

00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:13,660
identify the area where we think for any

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,820
Bulgarian NSA's ball brand's logo they

00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,580
have the same or similar out-of-the-box

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:23,020
user experience because let's face it in

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:26,770
this market very crowded market we don't

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:29,140
necessarily always have you know patient

00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,790
to go jumping with other hoops to be

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,550
able to get some basic stuff working and

00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:36,220
we believe actually how the best user

00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,260
experience really help people to get

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,840
their hands up for those ones hood not

00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:43,450
necessary kind of hacker to be able to

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,060
make the best of use of the boards they

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,460
have so those are the arrows that we

00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,980
have identified usability absolutely

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,710
absolutely key and documentation we

00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,750
already are making a big push or not we

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,360
like to have the you know basically

00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,830
level universal our support you have the

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,570
same experience across all anything

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:07,270
sports and we would want tutorials a lot

00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,910
of them which you actually will see some

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:13,960
of the very exciting and

00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:17,710
works from our partners sorta later so

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:21,070
showcase project you know we go on the

00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:23,680
Raspberry Pi websites as I said we don't

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,420
consider them competitor that we do pick

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,810
their brains and learn the lessons we

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:32,320
have as we have learned so we are

00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:35,310
looking at some of the showcase projects

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,020
well we can maximize people's

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:41,920
imagination in using nanotech sport

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:43,300
because I mean 96 ports for a lot of

00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,840
money thing sport we are using the

00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,670
latest greatest slc but not using the

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,140
seafront 10 years ago right we're using

00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:54,190
associate which was launched to six

00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,230
months three months ago in fact very

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,480
shortly you will see another extreme

00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:02,560
case we're using as you see launched

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:06,310
yesterday like yesterday we will be

00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:09,220
launched on line 6 board so so these are

00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,990
the errors which we are large

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,210
participation and we are working very

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,070
hard on in fact you will see some of

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:18,010
this ready today because they are not

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,440
just slogans they are actually happening

00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,000
actually will show one of the example

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:27,700
later today from our partner for us

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,890
robotics were West use robotics ok ok so

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,890
automotive our robotics and Jones and

00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:38,830
demo friday as well so virtual reality I

00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:40,870
have I think as available applications

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,510
or raping the back and some of them in

00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:50,260
the work artificial intelligence will

00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:53,020
talk about later when we get to them so

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,450
people ask what's next because they

00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,880
actually know I started is contained in

00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,280
saying the question I got asked a lot or

00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,890
12 months ago is why do we do this at

00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,070
all and today I got asked a question

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,760
more section today so it was what do we

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,800
do next what T sink you wish to do next

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,290
so this is our view and we will select

00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,320
your input so we'd like to hear from you

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:20,860
but so this is our view we think by

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,700
splitting these two different group by

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,160
no means saying which ones more

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,590
just have different focus first group is

00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,810
community United States Bothwell we are

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,650
support and the hosting vendo build

00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:35,180
software and follows analysis go

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,920
hardware specification compliance

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,230
requirements and documentation complies

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,840
because that's how everybody else be

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,000
able to use your board and also second

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,390
group is a 96 linaro reference platform

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,900
30 finances goes well the board will

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:53,630
become a reference hardware platform

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,700
used by other engineering group core

00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,920
engineering segment group or junior

00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,140
groups within an hour in factored form

00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,170
any of you who have you know who

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,870
probably have noticed and today's this

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:09,410
morning's George's keynote just about

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:12,800
every demos on magnetics board and some

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:16,490
of them are of course certified 96 boat

00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:19,270
harbor peplum sew on that group we would

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:22,760
really like to be a stream focused and

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:26,270
to be able to create near mainstream ain

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:30,230
lines experience because those are

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:32,270
important for the critical in our

00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,420
corporate collaborative engineering work

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:38,000
for you to be able to benefit the neural

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:41,360
engineering output well i mean i think

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,180
thats a yes certainly need if we clarify

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,580
exactly what that means if you go online

00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,820
its export website you will find that so

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,980
we have specific requirements or

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,830
recommendations on firmware on

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,920
bootloader sorry on bulldozer and

00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:01,400
Colonel those actually are the main area

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,900
were not asking you to open up hundred

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,090
percent now racing for those ones you

00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,740
don't have actual obligation to open but

00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:10,640
we do suggest in the boot loader and the

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:13,040
colonel well the differentiation doesn't

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,810
make any sense or it makes sense for you

00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,740
but it does not make sense to create a

00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:20,510
single community and by no by foster

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,820
competition because those are the area

00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:26,840
where we do not believe adding much

00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:30,350
value for so other than that so you know

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,380
we do not have any stream and instantly

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:37,760
apartment

00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:41,080
formula is POA graphics stuff so that's

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,660
what I think that's to clarify that and

00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,910
we would like to be able to bring out

00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,460
actually no so we are working with

00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:53,210
multiple partner at this point to bring

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,420
out the first by no means the only 96

00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:59,000
boat networking platform as i said we

00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,740
understood this market actually has will

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,500
be one with the most exciting peaceful

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:08,240
arm to penetrate and nine sensible

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,920
networking platform is a draft stage so

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,870
has been reviewed by the 96 Boston

00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,600
Committee as well as like a lean on that

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,310
working group LNG and so we're working

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,490
with we're talking about with multiple

00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:21,500
slc windows we are looking at low and

00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,570
middle layer and enterprise storage and

00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,870
networking platform so if any of you

00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:29,690
today are interested in engaging with us

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,630
and either your SOC band or manufacture

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,040
partners and please come and talk to us

00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:38,290
would like to work with you as I said we

00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:40,970
have trouble we re in the world so

00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,930
hopefully my next kinetic we're going to

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,220
see some the interesting announcement

00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:49,550
here now better exposure to wider

00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:54,140
community that's quite easy to say

00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:55,760
actually harder to do because we are

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,910
saying that we're seeing a lot of

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,610
nannies exports being designed being

00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,170
manufactured but one of the Arab we

00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:05,390
noticed is actually we are not

00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,750
necessarily great in terms of

00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:10,010
distribution right it is actually we

00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,750
have the job for a lot of Hoops to

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,600
actually get the board to the developers

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:16,700
hand and because by nature we are

00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,290
targeted global audience I mean that's

00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,840
something which we really like to work

00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:23,180
on so if any of you who I know some of

00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,720
you here are coming from distribution

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:29,270
channel because I I saw your name

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,280
basically so if you're interested

00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:35,060
program come talk to us I work like to

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,680
engage so we are engaging with some of

00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,240
the higher education institutions and

00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,980
the one of the panel you particularly

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,470
has done another very well here

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:47,760
dragon board we're going to keep doing

00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:49,169
that so we're working with more we would

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,590
like to work with more manufacture for

00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:54,510
diversified design as I said

00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:57,120
specification is a starting point by no

00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:59,400
means want to limit and constrain the

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,520
capability as associate you won't offer

00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,320
you want to market we encourage that

00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,929
differentiation that's what we matters

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,540
we want to focus we want to incur you

00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:12,389
the focus your energy in differentiating

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:15,119
those error were really matters but

00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:16,320
don't repeat it doing everything you

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,940
know the same thing everybody else has

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,220
to probably my pretty much in the same

00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:25,950
way encourage Matheny's development

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:29,190
across adoption I just want to give you

00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:31,350
example that's a couple of madness we

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,820
did ourselves just you know getting

00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:37,169
started and in the pier is the last year

00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,280
for the small you are bored or sin

00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:41,730
support for example we are shipping

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,950
about 500 permanent design without any

00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,919
effort in terms of promotional marketing

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:50,190
such we just we just did a pull our

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:51,540
website and whoever has need so that's

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,250
the quantity you looking at for those

00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,780
ones who just about to start or once you

00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,850
start working with I don't give you a

00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,520
good example I think with a big push for

00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:02,310
those more interesting imaginings this

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,830
give you an idea what kind of income you

00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:10,530
probably will bring in one thing I would

00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:14,220
say is with the explosion probabilities

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,930
bit too much but with very very quick

00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,619
ramping up as a number with both you

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:21,150
have because if you follow through the

00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:24,869
standard interface or special occasion

00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:27,000
we are we push for your bush you're

00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:30,420
imagining design should just walk across

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,180
with others in that case you know is in

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,680
terms of times of the possibility or

00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,060
madam cassy the reason why we keep

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,550
saying this is imagining officer it's

00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,520
not nice it for itself but we believe in

00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:43,880
PA beliy prepare for that product

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,619
oriented design product oriented

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,050
applications Madeline is one of the key

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:51,780
thing to get them is your arms to

00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,579
actually get reach out to get the final

00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,559
product out

00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,779
so there's a clear demand from the

00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,670
mezzanine from from target audience of

00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:02,440
the all posts we already know that's a

00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:04,930
clear requested for some of you sitting

00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,549
today multiples associate vandals have

00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:11,670
clear knees and have actually clear

00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:16,269
target design magazines are in the work

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:19,650
so we will be kicking off an n64 partner

00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:24,609
program which is targeted at a small

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:26,829
start our place and yes our face and

00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:30,219
makers and manual parts are weird we

00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:31,869
already have the first one who has made

00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:33,640
arrangements so you should be able to

00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:36,519
see that we are kicking off that program

00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:42,400
which is helping to get this part of a

00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:44,380
community kick off so those are the

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,809
things which we want to do and we want

00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,999
to be bad at and of course everything

00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:50,799
else which you can see the importance

00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:52,569
and willing to help I think what I'm

00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:55,449
saying this dynasty school is not about

00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:58,239
what mineralized what 90s board t wants

00:36:55,449 --> 00:37:00,099
to do it's about how to help you how to

00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,369
help you to achieve what you want to go

00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:04,989
and we might have our view of housing

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:07,299
should be devout how well we should pull

00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,369
i butt in but it's your voice that

00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:11,229
counts right it's your voice what you

00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:14,410
want to go how we can help that counts

00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:17,619
but to able to have a platform at

00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:19,749
jamaica platform deliver the latest and

00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,239
greatest a selfie to the developer hands

00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:25,180
which enable rapid product development

00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,430
and prototyping to you know to expand

00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,949
your new revenue stream for the soc

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,410
vendor or to give you opportunity to

00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:35,170
design more magnuson for the photo

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:37,749
manufactured design house whatever that

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,640
might be we are here to help and hope to

00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:43,209
hopefully this program will be able to

00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:46,989
bring what you want to achieve so that's

00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:50,859
the end of my presentation and i won't

00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:52,839
have the time to showcase the robots on

00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:56,890
the use robotics representative heithaus

00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:59,819
desk but the robot will be in the 90s

00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,819
for hacking room and

00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,490
so just a quick word on that so that's

00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:12,250
the first a portage goo Goo's tensorflow

00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,960
deep learning platform on shoe or 96

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:18,270
balkan fact the bubble gum in this case

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:21,940
action samus chips with the imagination

00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,860
GPU so very interesting in plastic devil

00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,780
please go and take a look and have a

00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,040
chat with hide how to see what you can

00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,800
find it's also including the voice

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,960
recognition of course but but society

00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,620
the first implementation important we we

00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,120
know to arm to our chooses 64 so that's

00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,500
the end of my presentation as i said i

00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,600
were trying to be enough time for

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:44,850
pressures now always open for question

00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,850
we got 10 minutes thank you

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:03,810
this is rob hero robot and we have the

00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:06,089
control interface and inside rap hero

00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:10,440
head we were deployed in bubble gum 96

00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:12,210
port and we poured it tends flow of the

00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,770
Google steep learning infrastructure

00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:19,740
into into this robot and this is the

00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:23,099
first part of the arm 64 so it can be

00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,920
used to identify the different object if

00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,890
you put it here you eat will were

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,980
recognized about I mean that we use that

00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:33,990
already trained get the train the model

00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:42,810
so that can recognize about a thousand

00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:46,280
out different objects we're also using a

00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:53,329
text to speech engine that who were just

00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:55,740
to speak what is the object sorry the

00:39:53,329 --> 00:40:00,510
probability of the battery is not not

00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:03,869
running a very well so maybe we can we

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:07,800
currently done most of the demonstration

00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:09,630
at the 96 hacking room so just give us

00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,490
maybe a 15 minutes to recharge the

00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:14,990
battery and we can give the more time

00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,990
and straight there thank you

00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:24,480
thanks I'd up to any questions

00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:41,930
darn it dates or plans or yes so 999 I

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,800
mean this is like one of this match is

00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:48,890
king fake yellow things not know where

00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,559
can i buy it so we should be able to get

00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:53,780
the board to all that be ready to sell

00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:55,250
you know we have within this year so

00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,970
that's for sure the question is which

00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:01,849
month what's interesting about this

00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,680
board is one over the thing which you

00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:06,500
feel you know notice from 9-6 without

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,990
his specification is denaro is not only

00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,270
looking at kodak say all codecs and

00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:14,420
coyote we are looking across a spectrum

00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:15,650
from collects em are a but that'll

00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:19,579
really incorporated in the hardware

00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:21,740
specification and later this week no one

00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:26,359
of the initiative driven by our October

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:28,339
fees devil himself is looking at gateway

00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:34,059
specifically this is a very interesting

00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:36,859
area and a gap which we think is clearly

00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:39,109
well target of this bullet should be

00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:40,910
able to provide a vehicle a vehicle to

00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:42,980
extra for allowing us to explore that

00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,569
space so I can't give you too much

00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,059
detail at this stage because this ball

00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:48,770
is not yet ready to sell and some of the

00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:52,549
worker software by the worst year in the

00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:54,290
cook but i will say from the pricing

00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:57,530
points and the from the capability of

00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,880
this board and from the targets usage of

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,980
the body so it cannot be a very

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,859
interesting platform and of course the

00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,500
fact matter that this orange pie so are

00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:08,210
those people who behind who were

00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,940
competing with raspberry pi and we've

00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,980
got this orange power 2 pi 0 the factor

00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,740
for them to join an e6 bowl and look and

00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,990
be able to produce this ball so quickly

00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:20,720
it's a clearly a sign overconfidence all

00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,799
benefit of doubt for the image i think

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,200
these are things that could be very

00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:25,609
interesting use case in this board but i

00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,319
can't go into too much detail in terms

00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,680
of the software capability on a board

00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:29,680
will be

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,920
yes

00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:53,279
yeah so that is definitely we have

00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:56,549
discussed that when the boat before the

00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:58,739
dam was finalized I think the main the

00:42:56,549 --> 00:43:01,140
answer is there's a limitation on the

00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:02,970
soft side which does not make sense to

00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,499
have the paint that that connected i

00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:06,720
wish that actually cant cannot be

00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:11,730
supported that's really the main reason

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:13,829
so just that's why you know this 24 pin

00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,140
was used we should not follow the sea

00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:19,460
specification sorry addendum of

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,460
ceaseless became of the cameras bank

00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,460
it's another question about this one

00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:31,430
who's working on the upstream part that

00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:35,000
can I review the code somewhere for the

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:36,680
orange I board yes okay so the board our

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,259
currently understanding is the one ball

00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,180
is available will be delivered with a

00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:43,640
vendor build which will get big ubuntu

00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,500
and so could you could delay the

00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,190
delivery of the part for maybe six

00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:51,470
months after the code is out and some

00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,670
reason clash again it would be nice to

00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,130
have to code out six months before

00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,779
delivering the hardware could you just

00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,930
delay delivering the hardware maybe that

00:43:56,779 --> 00:44:02,089
much yeah so I mean obviously in the

00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:05,509
previous slides what we said actually we

00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:07,880
are going to targeted splitting the two

00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:11,089
different group of both one is a

00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,910
community board well we do not have the

00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:15,440
requirement or be fully upstream right

00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,730
but this one for this one doesn't make

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,890
sense right this one would have to be

00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:22,099
upstream yeah that's what i said so for

00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:24,619
this board at this point in time we only

00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:27,410
know the plan over having providing or

00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:29,569
vendor bills so that we are still in

00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:32,180
discussion in terms of what upstream

00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:34,009
plan will be loop well looks like but i

00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,829
don't have the full detail to share with

00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:38,690
you yet and how that time frames look at

00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:40,700
whether there is a plan to fully be for

00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:42,470
the upstream bowl okay so there's no

00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,680
data sheet or source code for that trip

00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:50,150
yet sorry there's no data sheet for the

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,640
trip yet and no source code I think this

00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:54,650
chip itself is not new but I don't

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,390
believe is for its being fully upstream

00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,490
no there's nothing opportune about that

00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:00,680
ship I was just wondering if it's why

00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:03,799
like what why can't we just look at the

00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,259
source code now because as I said I the

00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:08,859
vendo provide you know when do build oh

00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:11,059
is it when we understood that's not

00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:13,250
including all the source code the food

00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:15,319
in source code the wallet so I'm talking

00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:18,769
about linux here and just being i just

00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:21,890
mean the colonel just why not just send

00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:26,089
the source code out now it is actually

00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:30,519
window decision I mean no but they but

00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:35,259
what if the sort if the trip is new

00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:35,259
doesn't anybody have the source code yet

00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:41,329
the of course the armies of course

00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:44,329
also in this case the silk vendo is our

00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:46,339
da right but in this case the party who

00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:48,410
has engaged with us during the police

00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:49,910
manufacture partner so these people

00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:54,380
actually taking initiative doing the

00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:56,180
design I really can't answer in terms of

00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:59,150
the intention whether it wants to become

00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,920
the fully certified hardware or not if

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,829
it is the case i'm not talking about

00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,239
certified i'm just wondering like who

00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:08,119
has the source code and why don't we

00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:10,999
have that or at the moment vendor has

00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:14,720
the Vandal of the bill oranga pi has but

00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:16,369
how well ask them to give it to us that

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,999
the can't be that hard i mean it's EPL

00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:21,710
just oh yeah i mean every so the kernel

00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:23,299
source code we know it could be

00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:26,839
published one talking about is whether

00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:30,589
there will be a fully ab streamed poor

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,680
support for that platform yang could you

00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:36,200
just ask them to give us the software

00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:40,190
yeah so I said I mean as I said I also

00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:42,319
question 22 ricardo earlier we are in

00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:46,819
discussion with the wendell but I don't

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:48,650
have a conclusion yeah so we don't have

00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:51,289
the conclusion so i cant a category

00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:56,749
commit on their behalf and it's a start

00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:58,279
basically the reality of it but thanks

00:46:56,749 --> 00:47:00,380
for the question it is a question well i

00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:02,359
mean we are a society we are discussing

00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,099
the software plan but we don't have the

00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:05,210
commitment or the answer yet when we

00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:07,420
have with a definite share with

00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,420
everybody

00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:22,779
so the short answer is we don't know yet

00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:24,519
so that we have some ideas of what we

00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:27,939
want to work on what won't implement

00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:31,059
when both becomes available but it still

00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:32,949
is really too early stage okay that's

00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:38,499
the contradiction when the boot becomes

00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:40,359
available Oh what what are you so you're

00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:42,429
going to specify it after a board

00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:45,539
becomes available no I mean this is our

00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:49,029
order so we just launched a light group

00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:50,979
this morning today right and there's a

00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:52,599
certain area of focus we have been

00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:56,769
working on in conjunction with a light

00:47:52,599 --> 00:48:00,249
group this will gateway what will be

00:47:56,769 --> 00:48:02,859
going to gateways you know I LT groups

00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:05,919
gateway RPP is really stealing a very

00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:08,679
early stage of design so we are looking

00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:11,380
at it as I said later this week at David

00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:13,269
and we will have a discussion teacher

00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,239
discussion on that but at this point I

00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:18,339
have literally have nothing to share at

00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,709
what we're going to the Gateway design

00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:22,749
in terms of their work and just a

00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:26,109
follow-up what is the current status of

00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:29,049
the enterprise boards all right thanks

00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:32,019
for asking that question so obviously

00:48:29,049 --> 00:48:34,779
that we didn't anticipate that we have

00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:38,349
so cello board was announced last year

00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:42,839
sorry early this year in connect which

00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:44,890
carries AMD port herbs or AMD slc

00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:47,650
everything is ready for production and

00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:51,509
the pre-order window is open we hit a

00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:53,229
roadblock in terms of one part a one

00:48:51,509 --> 00:48:58,199
particularly part of the board

00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:58,199
functionality is no it's not working and

00:48:58,229 --> 00:49:05,619
currently the bodies in AMD's hands been

00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:07,299
debugged as we speak we do expect to be

00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:10,630
able to resolve that issue with SOC

00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:13,150
burned or very shortly and certainly no

00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:16,209
in in terms of weeks time but at the

00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,829
moment thats fault energy has to be has

00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:19,839
to be walking before the board became

00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:23,319
you know can shake basically it has to

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:27,820
be working on that particularly parts so

00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:30,160
