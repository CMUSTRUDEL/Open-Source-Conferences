Title: Overview of IoT Zephyr

Bio:
Geoff Thorpe heads up security within the Microcontroller group of NXP, where the intersection of device security and network security gives him a headache commonly known as “IoT”. His early experience with security topics was very software-centric, as a long-standing member of the OpenSSL team and a contributor to related open source projects. After many years veering off into semiconductors and hardware architecture, his software-bias has been domesticated to some extent but not eradicated.

9. … and scratch that itch
10. What is “IoT security”?
11. What is “IoT”?
12. What is “IoT”? •Traditionally-offline “things”  going online
13. What is “security”?
14. Usage “Add security to the product” “Secure the edge-node” “Integrated security, because security is important”
15. Abusage “Add security to the product” “Secure the edge-node” “Integrated security, because security is important” And by security you mean … what exactly?
16. Does “security” mean… • Tamper-proof? • Resistant to side-channel attack? • Able to perform cryptographic operations fast/efficiently? • Key-protection and other logical separation? • Supports secure network protocols? • Protects content restrictions against misuse? • Is kept up-to-date through patch updates? • Reliable/robust in the face of adversarial RF? • You did some code reviews (this time round)?
17. Security facets, a less incomplete list Cryptography; • Software optimization • Hardware IP • Protocol security, interoperability • Privacy, authentication, non-repudiation Secure non-volatile storage Inline encryption (memory, flash, …) Trusted execution (secure boot, …) Key management and protection Certification Code quality and review Vulnerability analysis Best practice Process and production security Compartmentalization/isolation Digital Rights Management IP protection (anti-cloning, …) Resistance to side-channel attacks • Power • Timing • Electromagnetic emissions Emergency response Security maintenance Attack detection Reliability (quality-of-service, stability, …)
18. What is “security”?
19. What is “security”? •“Security” on its own can mean almost anything “Security” on its own means almost nothing •It’s almost always context-dependent, in terms of interpretation and importance of those different facets. •“The minimization of insecurity (or ‘threats’)” ?
20. What is “IoT security”?
21. What is “IoT security”? The meeting (perfect storm) of two domains; •Device security •Network and logical security
22. What is “IoT security”? Device Security Network Security Secure non-volatile storage Cryptographic s/w and h/w Inline encryption (memory, flash, …) Protocol security & interoperability Trusted execution (secure boot, …) Usability and clarity Key management and protection Code quality and review Certification Best practice Vulnerability analysis Emergency response Process and production security Security maintenance DRM & IP protection (anti-cloning, …) Attack detection Resistance to side-channel attacks Reliability (quality-of-service, stability, …)

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
yes free conference and you're talking

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,390
before nine a.m. in the morning there's

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,940
going to be nothing but crickets

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,670
everyone's going to be hungover stoned

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,080
or broke right so I'm going to do it

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,790
John masters if you don't mind it take a

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,119
quick little video just to prove them

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,500
wrong so if you would all just give me a

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,619
sign of life just to prove you're not

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:29,220
actually incapacitated due to vegas is

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:30,869
lifestyle awesome thank you so as do i

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,270
mentioned i'm going to give a quick surf

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,070
over the subject of zephyr and try and

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,270
tie this into a few views i want to

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:45,149
share on IOT security the first up on a

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,260
shack thank Dave ever George and all the

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,340
others from linaro for putting this

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,230
together and particular for the

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,149
invitation to come and talk there's my

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,770
first connect than I certainly hope it's

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,530
not the last so just a little context of

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,070
where I'm coming from objectivity is an

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:05,810
illusion as you know so this gives you a

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,880
sense of my bias I work in the

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,520
microcontrollers group of mxp and I hit

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,409
up security in the R&D group I would

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,210
kick this off by mentioning that there's

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,280
not a software specific thing so I

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,490
generally come at this this area from a

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,650
hardware point of view but I have a

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,360
background of software for the sins of

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,070
my youth of a member of a project called

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,009
openssl some of you may have heard of

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,720
and have worked around web servers and

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,180
other sort of network related activities

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
in open source and in the hardware side

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,310
I've been working on our networking

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,750
hardware architecture and over the last

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,880
couple years in the microcontroller

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,700
group working on apps processors and

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,500
microcontrollers and all the security

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,759
subjects therein excuse me I just

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,020
mentioned at the end excuse me for my

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,630
accent I'm from Wellington New Zealand

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,619
and I have I think the distinct

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,299
privilege of being one of the few

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,430
Wellingtonians that was not involved in

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,619
any way at all in Lord of the Rings so I

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,119
just mentioned that an ungenerous

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,790
colleague actually described me as

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:11,009
looking like a elf on a bad

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:12,569
hair day so mm-hmm excuse me so the

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,040
agenda I came here with

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:18,120
what I was hoping to cover was to give

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,769
you a broad sweep of the Zephyr project

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,980
talk about you know the where the why

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:24,480
the how the men and all of that and then

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,859
to go through IT security which is

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,540
really more my topic and it's my

00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:33,030
interest however there's been a lot of

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,200
talked already about Zephyr and for

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,569
those of you who are fortunate to be

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,450
here wednesday afternoon and see Alice's

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,889
talk on Zephyr he's already done a lot

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,189
of detail on this and that's video

00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:45,780
that's its online so for detail I I

00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:47,760
strongly recommend just going and taking

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,760
a look over that at your leisure I won't

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,699
try and regurgitate and in any case

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,439
couldn't do justice to that so I'm going

00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,870
to keep it relatively superficial in

00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
terms of this f a project per se there

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,840
to try and home in on some of the

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:07,079
security considerations more

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:10,199
specifically um this is a I guess I'm

00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:13,260
marketing slide so we'll try not to one

00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,879
thank you try not to dwell but the code

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,769
base behind Zephyr has been around in

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,129
various different forms for about twenty

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,530
years it's been in aerospace and a bunch

00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:24,209
of other industries so this this new

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,599
project is not necessarily a new code

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:30,689
and but it's been given a new lease of

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:36,000
life it comes out of wind river it's a

00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:37,829
cross architecture artists and I think

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,329
can tell somewhat courageously had sort

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,829
of realized that when you look at the

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,439
dynamics of Linux and you look at

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:46,259
successful open source projects that

00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:51,780
attempt to provide a kind of positively

00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:54,299
commoditized codebase that the that the

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,979
best avenue was in some sense all of us

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,769
seeding a certain amount of strategic

00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,120
control so that the the dynamics of the

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,849
open-source development model would kick

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,819
in and given where we are with IOT and

00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:08,939
how how disruptive it is right now how

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,299
much creativity and how much churn is

00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:14,430
going on we're quite hopeful that that

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,560
development model put in place now with

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,039
that code base in with those with a

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,329
critical part critical mass of parties

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:26,659
engaged means that there is a good

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,659
chance that we will see this take off

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,340
these are the Platinum members that are

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,650
on right now so nxp linaro is just

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,620
joined and we're super happy about the

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,050
life group we really have high hopes for

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,210
that and dare I say high expectations

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:47,340
met so nxp was was involved from the

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,500
outset I was I was really enthusiastic

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,710
about this I've kind of been championing

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,780
to anyone who'll listen and so I'm on

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,930
the governance board not on the

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,750
technical side so again I would defer to

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,130
Matt Kumar honest they're all here if

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,980
you guys want to find out more about

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,140
Zephyr find out some deep technical

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,490
details and get involved with a coding

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,450
level you know you've got you've got the

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,340
right people here and we have Intel of

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,590
course and synopsis is also there and

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,400
we're expecting this list to grow over

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:22,560
the next few months and quick view of

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,430
the of the project model the governance

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:31,710
model so this is an attempt if you will

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:36,330
to consolidate both the open-source

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:39,390
meritocratic development model we have a

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,160
technical steering committee and and I

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,170
think a pretty good community model for

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,380
everyone being able to just lean in and

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,110
do what it is they want to do without

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,850
any of these you know key commercial

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,710
entities really getting in the way or

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,870
constraining the development and the

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:59,220
innovation by petty strategic concerns

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,280
but at the same time to provide it with

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,590
a robust critical mass of backing we

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,140
have people funding this we have budgets

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:13,320
we have marketing I'll get into the

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:14,700
security side shortly so we have a

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,250
charter here this follows the Linux

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,110
Foundation model they are they put this

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,120
thing together and brought the members

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,500
together and so we have a charter the

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,260
governance model is involved in things

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,940
like that if there's a if they're in if

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,010
we need to change things in the Charter

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,360
if we need to do things about what we

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,090
what we're budgeting what were actually

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,910
funding in terms of just accepting then

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,220
that that becomes a governance question

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,780
marketing and security but the the key

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,660
technical activity isn't

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:49,560
decoupled so we're trying to have the

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:52,440
best of both worlds in that respect this

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,690
um I guess the serves is what we've been

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,220
harping on since Monday as we would

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,530
really really welcome people getting

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,070
involved participating in whatever way

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,750
suits you we're still at a very

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,940
formative time with the project there's

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,290
a lot of flux things are moving lots of

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,389
really interesting discussions going on

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,040
as to security again I'll come to that

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,780
in a second the networking stuff right

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,970
now is undergoing a lot of examination

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,530
and we're making a lot of key decisions

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,490
so people to get involved right now are

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,290
going to have an opportunity to

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:25,140
participate in that and have an

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:26,820
influence on where this goes and I guess

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,250
the the key point here is that for

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,260
people who have things that they want to

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,660
get done we're trying to make this in

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,140
some kind of metaphoric sense and of

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,340
course you can stretch the metaphor but

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,660
we're looking to have a kind of a linux

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,280
for for MC use where you just if you've

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,140
got an itch you scratch it the barrier

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,130
to entry the tools are free they're easy

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,690
the the code it's good control the

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,190
layouts pretty straightforward if we can

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,450
just get in there and start rummaging

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,229
around and seeing what they can come up

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,400
with so I should also mention of course

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,979
it had occurred to me yesterday when I

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,270
was reviewing my slides that there is a

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,979
somewhat unfortunate reputation in the

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,820
open source community that developers

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:10,830
are shabby and hearing and of

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,450
questionable personal hygiene that was

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:20,460
certainly not the the intention of that

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:22,350
that energy so what is IT security there

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:30,510
is an awful lot being said on this topic

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:32,610
I'm not going to try and evangelize a an

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,020
inexpensive you or products in Turkey or

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,349
a business and marketing centric view

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,140
but that does tend to be the the

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:42,180
dominating formulation for what we mean

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,250
by IOT security so I'm going to try and

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,260
dig into the terms a little bit and

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,800
bring it into sort of an engineering

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,540
perspective to try give meaning to what

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm subsequently going to say but I

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,780
wanted to share with you we have a

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,870
a marketing group has cooked up a a neat

00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,190
little presentation and this is um

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,440
security is a big challenge for the

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,330
Internet of Things you can't avoid it

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,370
we're talking about people's homes

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,680
security cameras and health information

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,660
and infrastructure like roads and

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,210
buildings if people don't trust that

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,250
they're secure they won't deploy IOT

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,230
devices and that's why the Zephyr

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,990
project is an artist designed with

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,660
security in mind for small footprint IOT

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,580
devices near cryptography isn't enough

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,280
anymore so that's why Zephyr goes

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,260
further and it's very foundation Zephyr

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,240
runs on single executable binaries

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,220
meaning every feature is compiled

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,230
upfront throughout the project's

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,850
development every component goes through

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,920
a rigorous lifecycle to check the

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,110
security of the feature once a feature

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,060
is added to the project its reviewed for

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,640
security and compiled into the static

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,100
binary this doesn't stop bad code from

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,260
existing it's a fact of life in software

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,540
development so the Zephyr project is

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,640
designed around tools and processes to

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,500
minimize the risk of insecure code being

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,660
included a community project members

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,240
reviews every feature to make sure that

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,070
sound security practices are applied as

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,990
code is implemented into the Zephyr

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,120
project and features that relate to

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,310
security get extra scrutiny through our

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,860
security risk assessment regular code

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,620
reviews ensure compliance functionality

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,390
readability and maintainability static

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,430
code analysis finds complex and

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,950
significant functional and security

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,080
defects and survivability ensures that

00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,210
security vulnerabilities that happen

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,730
upstream from Zephyr are addressed and

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,890
disclosed appropriately the result when

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,750
you incorporate Zephyr security updates

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,330
your edge device has become more

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,670
functional and more securable and we're

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,470
just getting started we have several

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,180
groundbreaking features in mind and

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,610
we're looking for thought leaders to

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,100
help build them out and add more peyote

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,620
is the future and Zephyr is the future

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,170
of IOT you can help make the future of

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,420
IOT more secure by downloading the code

00:10:50,170 --> 00:11:00,520
and contributing join us by visiting

00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:02,200
Zephyr project org today so this when I

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,960
don't have a cold I really do sound as

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,460
slick as that guy but this is obviously

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,840
a

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,490
a view of Zephyr that we're trying to

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,140
that we've put together in the hopes of

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,420
addressing the kind of people that you

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,130
are not which is to say marketing people

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,410
business people these are the people

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,690
that we need to to key into it and in

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,990
Friday a formulation for what we're

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,370
doing that they will understand and so

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,840
that's what I felt like sharing that

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,820
with you today but what I'm going to try

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,950
and get into is to is to peel past some

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:35,230
of this high-level view and share my

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:39,490
personal thoughts on IOT and security

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,810
and what what we think that means and so

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,100
to talk about IOT security I guess we

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,310
need to talk about IOT and that I think

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,260
is is the most complicated term right

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:52,600
now there's a lot of nonsense that's

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:54,220
been said on this topic the it is

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,570
usually attempted to be described in

00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,940
terms of market segments form factors

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,470
products basically and that's an

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,240
inherently problematic view because of

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,920
course it tends to grow you can't find

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,030
an IOT slide deck today that doesn't

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,260
include automotive for example but for

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,820
an engineering perspective of a lot of

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,340
those distinctions are a kind of

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,990
artificial you know a lot of the

00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,410
software practices a lot of the security

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,660
concerns are essentially you know the

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,330
same within what people define as i OT

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,710
and without it so from an entering

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,820
perspective and I'm certainly from a

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,050
security perspective when we've been

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,340
looking at this and looking at what

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,840
we're doing with our development now

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:36,010
research I think about the best way of

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,200
defining this we've come up with is

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,530
simply to say that I OT is whatever was

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:46,690
previously offline coming online and

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:48,940
it's a very flip flippant description

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,910
banaue perhaps but i think that cannot

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,510
consequences are non-trivial and that's

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,800
where it starts to get interesting

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,070
because this is how we can start to

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,730
address what the actual security

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:05,590
problematic is here and in what is

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:07,810
security well this too I think there's a

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,370
cliche that an image is worth a thousand

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,040
words i think this one proves that the

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,610
converse is sometimes true as well

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,720
security is a very vexing term so I'm

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,320
just going to start off by looking at a

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,020
couple of example sentences and then

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,190
is sometimes worth asking yourself do

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,960
you do you ever find yourself saying

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,110
things like this do you hear people

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,860
saying these sorts of things adding

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,420
security of the product you know

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,690
integrating security for example you

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,180
hear that quite often um it begs this

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:43,620
question right what why on earth are you

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,330
talking about on a daily basis in my job

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,650
I find people saying these sorts of

00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,830
things to each other and they both have

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:51,150
completely independent and and and

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,400
unrelated interpretations of what it is

00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,040
they mean and so it's a problematic word

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,660
and it's highly misused it's it's

00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
largely a psychological and an emotional

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,060
word it's supposed to make you feel

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,700
better no it's secure okay but what does

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,590
that mean and it's an interesting

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,480
exercise by the way if you start going

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,730
into conflict conferences and talks I

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,350
suggest having this little mental

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,520
exercise in your head and just wait for

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,950
the word to go flying past and ask

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,230
yourself what does that guy actually or

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,210
that girl really make clear what they're

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,580
talking about I'm going to peel this

00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:27,690
down a layer of two to try and

00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:31,290
illustrate where I'm getting it I hear

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:34,200
it used in all of these ways some people

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,600
are referring to you know devices that a

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,300
tamper-proof resistant to side channels

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,580
and so on and so on all of these things

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,820
even the last one in fact is is one of

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,690
the key usages and you know but all of

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,810
these are very different from one

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:52,560
another did you did you review the code

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:55,770
right is for complicated code bases is

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,960
in many ways the one of the most

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:02,550
critical security aspects of your

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,990
development and if I dig in even a

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,530
little bit further I've this is still an

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,460
incomplete list but I've tried to just

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:14,730
motivate what I'm talking about here

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:17,100
security is a many-faceted subject there

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,750
was in fact a bit occurred to me there's

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,190
another area that we're having

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,230
discussions with people about right now

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,350
where you would incorporate free

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,810
subjects like insurance risk management

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,820
these are also security topics going

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,490
forward but I'll come back to that

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,570
emergency planning is another one

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,160
so it still brings us back to our

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,160
original question I haven't answered it

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,270
security essentially on its own means

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,839
nothing at all because it's trying to

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:48,880
mean too many things and what it means

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,000
is usually context dependent and this is

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,160
where we're going to come back to IOT

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,390
one way of seeing that is thinking of

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,550
security as the minimization of

00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:03,100
insecurity flipping it on its head or

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:04,779
minimizing threat it helps to stimulate

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:10,380
an understanding of how wide a subject

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:13,720
it is and so coming back to IOT security

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,370
I think this is one of the key this is

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,380
came up I forget who it was he said it

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,390
yesterday but somebody had made the same

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,050
point in the the many many come from the

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,330
afternoon what we see is there's a

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,899
convergence of two different kinds of

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,890
security topics you can slice us in

00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,300
different ways with it i think this

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,390
turns out to be a key way of looking at

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:38,890
it because of the consequences device

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:41,170
security is a is a topic that covers the

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,720
particular physical attack but it

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,940
addresses the fact that there is a there

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,250
is an individual entity that is subject

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,870
to some kind of compromise whereas

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,880
network and logical security is really

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,350
more an attack on the design rather than

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,160
attack on the object or attack on the

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:59,709
individual entity as these two collide

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,660
we tend to find that that that fault

00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:03,520
line is more or less what we're talking

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,270
about with IOT in particular with IOT

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,089
security and it gives rise to a couple

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,650
of very arm it will first off actually

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:13,660
this is a this is just attempt to take

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,220
all those items I listed off before and

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,500
just to try and break them out into

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,760
these two areas it should be taken with

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,530
a grain of salt of course there's a lot

00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,760
of things here which ought to find

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:26,260
themselves on both sides I mean

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,059
cryptography is implicit in both side

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,790
channel and timing attacks apply to both

00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:33,820
of these areas as well but more or less

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:35,710
that's that's a rough separation of the

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,179
kinds of security we're talking about in

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:42,090
device security and what we're talking

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:44,320
about a network and logical security so

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,680
the interesting thing here is when these

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,090
assumptions

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,600
what we find and device security if you

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,790
actually look at the the the science

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,430
around secure elements you know banking

00:17:53,790 --> 00:18:00,410
and passports and you know critical

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:04,140
security but electrically low complexity

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,880
devices there's an awful lot of

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,280
engineering goes into these things huge

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,700
amount of engineering and an almost as

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,780
much work on QA certification and those

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,200
sorts of activities and it's a very

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:21,630
static monolithic way of working network

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,640
security from the other side if you work

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,620
in servers networking switches and those

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,210
sorts of things for the last 20 30 years

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,300
you've already well adapted to this

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,730
reality that things are dynamic threats

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,780
are evolving change has to has to

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:40,320
accompany that and so these two things

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:42,240
do not combine terribly well and so I OT

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,880
living on the front the forefront of

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:50,070
both is therefore an inherently

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,560
problematic topic area furthermore I

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,570
forget the exact statistic and it may no

00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,100
longer be relevant but there was a

00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:00,450
statistic a couple years ago saying that

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,250
by 2017 2018 over fifty percent of the

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,960
IOT edge nodes we're going to be

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:10,730
produced by companies startups that were

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:13,650
three years or less in existence and so

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,540
it's it's certainly indicative of what's

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,520
going on there we're no longer talking

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,210
about the kinds of manufacturers and

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,560
large companies that can bring to bear

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,510
armies of security engineers and

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,720
resources we're talking about often

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:32,070
mom-and-pop shops and in small outfits

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,380
who were spread very thinly so I've

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,560
tried to represent this in terms of risk

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,060
multiplying and in defense d multiplying

00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,770
in terms of what this is doing to the

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,790
attack surface what's this what this is

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:48,090
doing to what we need to address IOT of

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,970
course is going to suffer from its

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:54,360
success in terms of the proliferation

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:57,210
there's a huge amount of deployment the

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,600
the number of nodes is astronomical and

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,970
growing astronomically

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,090
they are again a combination of both

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,710
attack surfaces it's a it's a horrible

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,720
combination in that sense the attack

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,480
surface is large and of course the

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,610
incentive for attack is large on the

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,950
flip side it's been driven far more

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,140
heavily than any any any server

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,350
ecosystem in terms of commodity pricing

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,210
the the margins on these things the the

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,120
resources that can be consecrated to

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,210
development of IOT devices is very

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,420
precarious and so often preventative

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:36,390
proactive security to work is the first

00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,810
thing to go in terms of rationalizing

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,860
where you put your in engineering effort

00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,380
so come what if your pricing is going to

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,640
be a big issue finding a fixing bugs is

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,470
going to be an issue when things are so

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,120
heavily proliferated and you've got

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,940
developers who are doing everything from

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,380
raising VC funding producing demos

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,390
cleaning the toilets everything they

00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,300
just can't bring to bear the the kind of

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,890
security expertise that that objectively

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,950
would be required to do justice to these

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,960
to these products it's a reactive

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,420
security which is the the topic area

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,220
security which deals with what do you do

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,440
once you've shipped it's all very well

00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,930
to talk about working towards something

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,610
that's production worthy once it's out

00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,100
in the field how do you then handle

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,410
things so reactive security is going to

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,090
suffer in all likelihood and of course

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,650
the proliferation of these nodes means

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:30,000
that we may be proliferating a zombie

00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:31,440
network from the outset so that's the

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,330
apocalypse Tori I know everybody has

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,350
their own IOT security apocalypse story

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,490
that's mine want to just draw your

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,010
attention to a couple of observations

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:46,260
about the traditional microcontroller

00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:47,580
engineering world which is I think at

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,680
least in the context of our IOT

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,850
discussion is largely about this sort of

00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:56,460
thing non networked devices that find

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,500
themselves in these these verticals

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,480
industrial medical or a good examples

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,670
automotive is becoming increasingly a

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,470
good example as well and they heavily

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:07,380
engineered what for what I call a static

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:10,770
state of optimal security all of the

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,760
work is done in sort of an NPI mentality

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,370
up to the point where it's ready

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:19,600
ship it got certification done code

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:23,070
reviews analysis testing we move on to

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:28,750
something else that of course is

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:31,240
problematic furthermore the what we also

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,400
see is in the eye of the apps processes

00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:38,460
and increasingly the microcontrollers as

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:41,290
well this trend where their capacities

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,970
and Moore's Law and all the other kinds

00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,580
of trends they're mean that the

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,680
complexity of what we can and do with

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,660
the software means that we can no longer

00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,860
live in a static world we have to

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,240
confront the reality that these

00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,550
networking people have been dealing with

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,850
the decades which is that the complexity

00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,890
threshold has been crossed you you can

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,450
do your best to build a secure software

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:08,680
if you give it to me and you walk away

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:10,660
it's not secure anymore that's the point

00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,730
they're so reactive security is going to

00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,740
be something we have to bring to bear on

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,540
the microcontroller world which is not

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,510
something that it's geared for at least

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,920
to a large extent it's a very different

00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,570
mentality it's the device security

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,140
mentality and we need to bring the

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:30,340
network security mentality to it so I

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,380
bring up dlm if if you been to say a big

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,010
security conference like RSA in the last

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:38,020
couple years you would know that when

00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,610
RSA is in San Francisco you can't shake

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,950
a tree without two different dlm

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,840
solutions falling out of it everyone is

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:47,170
talking about cloud-based patch

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:51,460
management over-the-air updates and so

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,840
forth unfortunately that is and I don't

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,390
mean to be too cynical about those are

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,830
important and essential things but in a

00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,960
kind of networking metaphor that's

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:03,610
really just the last mile of the

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,350
solution the it and the opportunism

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,780
around it means to a large extent when

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:11,260
you're being proposed dlm you're being

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,820
proposed to provide a licensing revenue

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,580
to someone who wants to embed a root of

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,310
trust and get engaged and how you you

00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,860
sign your images the point I want to

00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:23,350
make here is that the the this can lead

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,120
us to a false sense of security in that

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,230
we're talking about how we get the

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,549
updates down to the vice

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,919
we're not talking about what is it we're

00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,140
updating and who's working on it who

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,350
found out about the problems where is

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,030
the actual code activity around

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,950
maintaining security upstream and all

00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:43,710
the way down the supply chain to the

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:46,419
point where dlm can even be a value add

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:51,370
so it's part of the answer but it's it's

00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:53,200
far from the answer so reactive security

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,640
as I mentioned is something that the the

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,200
networking space has been dealing with

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,600
for a long time I in particular have a

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,250
lot of painful experience with this in

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,020
the open SSL project where we are we're

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,090
on a war footing problems are being

00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,590
found they're being disclosed in various

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,179
different ways and we have to cope and

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,100
we're dealing with a lot of downstream

00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,270
activity that we have you know how do

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,020
you manage this how do you deal with

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:23,410
embargoes how do you institute the

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,669
appropriate policies and so on but then

00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,380
the question might be well then it can

00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:29,980
we just adopt the same methods and bring

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:32,940
those over that would be nice there are

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:36,160
at least a few problems with it though

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:39,400
the current the the way things are

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,160
handled in the networking world is

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,650
around CDEs the corner common

00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,890
vulnerability enumeration and cps which

00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,710
common platform enumeration and all of

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,850
that kind of activity there's a

00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:54,700
organizations like certain like there's

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,160
a few different certs is first org those

00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,980
kind of organizations that bring

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,919
together closed and open source up

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:08,110
streams to deal with you know the real

00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:10,660
time handling of security issues they

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,429
have evolved the scheme which is

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,850
starting to crack a little bit it was

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:19,809
already being pushed a couple of these

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:22,540
key issues are already be found in those

00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:26,590
devices and in those in those kinds of

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,940
systems where this kind of honorably

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,740
handling but i only get too much in the

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:34,990
detail but just to try and illustrate

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:38,049
the this deals with security at on a

00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,080
product basis which is to say a product

00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:43,049
typically has an operating system

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,870
has applications as a package management

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:48,539
solution and anything else any kind of

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,909
complicating firmware any subsystem any

00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:53,429
kind of intelligent it's buried down

00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:56,039
beneath that level is typically handled

00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:58,140
as a kind of opaque package it's just a

00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:01,200
binary firmware package you've probably

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,820
seen this in wireless for example with

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,549
Linux distributions where what may be a

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,649
fully fledged system in need of its own

00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:12,539
maintenance is just treated as some kind

00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:15,809
of a pig binary bundled into a package

00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:20,760
and at the product level that's just

00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:22,950
seen as an application that they've been

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,269
surviving with that we will not what we

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,260
find for example is that we have

00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,970
products that are based on a

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,620
microcontroller with a particular kind

00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,769
of software that would be worthy of this

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,860
kind of vulnerability tracking and yet

00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:36,480
what is one product operating system

00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,130
turns out to be a subsystem of a

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,370
subsystem of a subsystem of some other

00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,630
much larger product so how do you track

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,779
vulnerabilities that are applicable to

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,279
both with entirely different context so

00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,510
the current vulnerability handling

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,309
scheme doesn't work very well with this

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:54,480
and I'd like to draw your attention to

00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:55,919
the last point this there are there's

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,510
some nastiness buried in this because

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,519
what you also see with the traditional

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,659
operating systems like Linux and servers

00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:06,570
and networking is that the supply chain

00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:08,970
typically is is adding it's adding

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,760
packages it's adding layers is adding

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,230
configuration and so forth what we see

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,789
in the microcontroller space is that the

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,210
supply chain tends to be modifying and

00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:19,830
transforming so where as you might be

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,299
able to talk about a supply chain and

00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,389
the traditional sense talking about you

00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:26,309
know a package or some some upstream

00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:27,600
code that has an issue and needs to be

00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:30,570
tracked we need to figure out whose

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,710
effect didn't deal with that you can

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,289
track that down the supply chain

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,880
typically it's very difficult actually

00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:37,260
if you look at the way things are done

00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,179
in a microcontroller world where that

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,980
supply chain is actually fundamentally

00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:44,970
transforming tearing apart combining and

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,740
producing a result which it's been

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,059
sockets it's really not clear what the

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,360
relationship between the upstream of the

00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,800
downstream is anymore so these are all

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,380
unsolved problems

00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,700
I raise them because within Zephyr if

00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,170
we're going to do justice to Ohio T

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,420
security going forward we feel that it's

00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,820
incumbent upon us to look at these and

00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:07,580
to have Zephyr be an example of whatever

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:10,530
it is we think needs to be done so

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,450
certification is another subject I think

00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,630
they're already efforts out there people

00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,520
are talking about different kinds of

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:21,480
regulatory or other standards and

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,950
metrics for evaluating what what

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,540
security means and when it's good enough

00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,350
you know how can you validate that

00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:30,450
something is is worthy of being deployed

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:32,040
the problem here also is that this topic

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,620
comes from the device security world it

00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,480
comes from a world which builds its

00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,940
static deploys it and it just better

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,030
work the update mechanisms were never a

00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,320
possibility in any case so the

00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,770
certification is sort of followed this

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,150
certification is almost entirely today

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,700
about a value in IP you evaluate

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,760
hardware IP you evaluate software IP you

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,260
do all sorts of things to try and assure

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,990
yourself that it meets the necessary

00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:00,590
requirements and then it's done the

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,420
problem with that is that if so factor

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:07,380
prevents you from making modifications

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:08,280
it is it is allergic to change and of

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,510
course what do we know from the

00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,130
networking world is that if you're going

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:14,070
to be secure you have to actually on the

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:17,070
contrary change immediately as soon as

00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,120
you find something so certification has

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:22,070
never had much traction in the

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,070
networking well you've probably noticed

00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,920
IOT brings these two together you've

00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:31,230
seen you've seen the hacks right the

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,450
baby monitors you know screaming

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,190
Metallica songs that poor children and

00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:41,400
cars getting run off the road by

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:43,680
teenagers and so forth the lead is that

00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,960
the the push is going to come that's not

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,220
going to be acceptable and so people are

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,930
going to be asking for standards that

00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,790
can be measured and that can be brought

00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,440
to bear so that that can be get up got

00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,030
under control and I think we're going to

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,530
hit this problem as the certification is

00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,350
actually going in its current form to

00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:03,390
work against us so we're exploring a lot

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:06,260
of ideas we in particular nxp about what

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,260
might be done there are

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:15,400
and it seems that at least part of the

00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,330
solution is to actually not certify in

00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,280
addition to whatever kind of

00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,770
certification you do of implementation

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,870
is to in some sense certify the maturity

00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,460
of how you deal with software how you

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,380
get it to a point that it's ready to

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,300
ship and then how you deal with that

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,190
software going forward do you have the

00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,480
appropriate policies in place do you

00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,640
know the provenance of everything in

00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,530
your system if the vendors of those

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,240
components go out of business do you

00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,610
still have a way of properly

00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,720
decommissioning the device or getting a

00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,040
scroll into their code or the keys

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,410
there's kind of a process thing there

00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,540
which is the kind of de facto part of

00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,550
networking security but has never really

00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,340
been formalized in this way so as secure

00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:56,380
certification requirements come to IOT

00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:00,160
there is going to be this question how

00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,840
do you how do you formalize that and so

00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,690
where does fo fit into this or where

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,550
might differ fit into this I'm going to

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,770
present a few sort of personal use and

00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:12,060
that's all they are this discussion is

00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:16,480
still in its infancy I daresay but

00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:18,370
hopefully it'll motivate some brighter

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,020
people and me to get involved then to

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:25,510
help one of the things we are doing this

00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,250
has been baked into our understanding of

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:35,260
how the Zephyr project will be handled

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:36,760
going forward is to well actually I'm

00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,550
getting ahead of myself let's first just

00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,240
look at an example where you have some

00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:44,980
kind of upstream code base and someone

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,210
to whatever certification profile might

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:51,400
apply is looking to is to certify that

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:54,070
so they're pulling down the code there's

00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,870
a few modifications required they get

00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,730
certification of course further down the

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:01,360
path if you see the x-axis

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:03,190
chronologically and there's a couple of

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,720
complications with this first of all the

00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,180
upstream code generally is not being

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,810
developed with this in mind so there is

00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,250
no kind of constraint on what changes

00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:14,500
have to be made in order to reach that

00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,450
certifiable state and by the way I'm

00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,670
waxing a little lyrical here certified

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,120
auditable you know we're talking about

00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,390
hard

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,520
code and then what we pile on to that

00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,350
too in terms of certification and

00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,520
auditing and so forth is kind of a

00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:30,430
secondary thing we are talking about a

00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:33,550
security hardened code base which is a

00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:36,910
slower development than typical mainline

00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:40,300
upstream so there is no constraint in

00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:42,760
this model to the complexity and the end

00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,930
the diff the Delta required to take an

00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,940
upstream code base and make it

00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,710
certifiable and of course this means

00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,930
down the line the reconciliation of

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,570
updates and future releases with that

00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:58,300
certification ax activity is inherently

00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:00,970
complicated so what we've baked in to

00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,679
the Zephyr project as the as you recall

00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,179
where the governance model and security

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,800
subcommittee was was one of the

00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:09,850
subgroups of the governance or the idea

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,370
here is that we want to have this

00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:14,290
hardened activity within the project and

00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,510
we're trying to have our cake and eat it

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:19,480
at the same time so I'll try to

00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,250
elaborate what I mean by that by having

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,050
this hardening exercised within the

00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,360
project we want to create a kind of

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:27,159
coupling between that activity and the

00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,460
mainline upstream so that there is a

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:34,139
feedback loop there that keeps as much

00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:37,419
as possible the that distinction

00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,070
constraint and that this would be a

00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:40,389
continuous process so we can say to you

00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,980
can go off and make those kinds of

00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:44,260
changes and that's fine but if you start

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,520
changing this thing here next time we

00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,050
run certification we're going to have a

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,690
world of pain so we have to manage that

00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:53,260
have have those activities intertwined

00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,700
in some way it also creates an

00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,990
insensitive for a bit of mainline

00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,700
because you are going out of your way to

00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,470
make sure that the main line is as close

00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,090
as it can be to a hardened tree it's in

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:05,380
everyone's interest in this in this

00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:07,450
model and of course to do so without

00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,160
slowing down the rate of development

00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,990
innovation going on and that mainly

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,140
because as I say certification and

00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:17,170
similar activities tend to be very

00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:19,030
laborious formal and it's not amenable

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:22,690
to the kind of open source activities

00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:25,570
that most of us are fond of so this is

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,980
this is where we want to go and this is

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,300
where we hope it will happen we have the

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,310
technical steering committee which is

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,520
where the actual code

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:35,140
expertise is habits where we we bring in

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,850
the community and we engage and we

00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,510
provide an environment for that kind of

00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:43,000
development we have the security group

00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:44,800
which is of course thinking about

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,570
precisely these issues and to have them

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:52,510
working together and so if I try and

00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:54,460
summarize this kind of scatterbrain

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:59,040
assortment of security topics I've

00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:01,390
raised we want the artist to be as

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,610
production grade as it can be and

00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,740
consistently as production grade as it

00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,360
can be we don't believe that there's

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,490
anything to be gained by a throw it over

00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,740
the wall model and unfortunately I think

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:19,150
that's quite prevalent in the

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:20,320
microcontroller world so and the

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,320
vulnerability hands though I've above

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,640
said light type tech what I mean here is

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,120
these these form factors these kinds of

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,130
products that are that have this problem

00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,430
of systems of systems as it's sometimes

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,270
called or subsystems of subsystems

00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,010
looking at it the other way around and

00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,620
the security quality activities

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:41,440
integrated into the project and all of

00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,000
this you know trying to contribute in

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,860
some modest way to the emergence of some

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,020
sort of best practice around IOT

00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,880
security and to do so where we have a

00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,220
project we can sort of be a living

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,950
breathing example that will walk the

00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:57,970
walk and practice what it preaches so I

00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:02,440
appreciate your patience thank you for

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:03,730
bearing with me and this these are all

00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,770
interesting topics and passionate

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,030
subjects i'm passionate about and if any

00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,120
of you would like to come and see me and

00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,010
talk about this please do but all the a

00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,560
lot of the key people in zephyr here

00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,880
like people are here engage with them as

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,490
well if you have any thoughts on this we

00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,950
could really use sir all the feedback we

00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:23,950
can get and of course you've got the

00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:26,160
inches to scratch don't hold back thank

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,160
you very much

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,390
okay thanks Jeff I do want to introduce

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,710
just for a minute before we go Matlock

00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,950
if you don't know Matt Matt's the

00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:49,440
director of our new linaro IOT and

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:51,869
embedded group thanks Jeff that was a

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,150
fantastic presentation it really covered

00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,340
a lot of why we're doing light in a

00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,990
couple ways so I wanted to touch on that

00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,550
a little bit too I got a lot of

00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,050
questions this week after the

00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,680
announcement what exactly are we doing

00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:06,990
it would take another hour to talk about

00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,860
everything we're doing at least I don't

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,570
think we want to sit around for another

00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,100
hour we have we got coffee waiting for

00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,600
us out there so I'll just take a few

00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:17,360
minutes to highlight a few things that

00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:21,840
were that we're trying to solve I

00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:25,619
started doing embedded Linux almost 20

00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,390
years ago and back then what people did

00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:30,000
is they pulled down a kernel they hacked

00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,650
on it they ship the product and moved on

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,960
to the next thing and the next product

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,580
version pulled down another colonel

00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,520
repeat that work nothing ever went

00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,770
upstream and it's taken quite a few

00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,690
years for the general industry to get

00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:46,020
back to that model of up streaming

00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:48,440
thanks in a lot 22 linaro and the work

00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:53,760
we're doing here so we looked at

00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:57,090
launching light and what we should do we

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,000
looked at IOT of course and what are the

00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:02,130
major device types out there

00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,869
microcontrollers dominate IOT on the

00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,970
device side so it made sense for us to

00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:09,090
look at the microcontroller but

00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,650
obviously linaro is known for linux not

00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:14,340
necessarily for doing microcontroller

00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:16,350
stuff so we looked at what are the the

00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:19,320
OEMs and the semiconductor manufacturers

00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:20,880
doing for microcontrollers and it turns

00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,890
out they're doing the exact same thing

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,680
that was being done on embedded Linux

00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:27,030
back then that there's tons of great

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,180
open source projects that are being

00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:35,850
leveraged but people are in this applies

00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:37,560
to you know OEMs makers and in the

00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,359
seventies that people are taking these

00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,590
open source projects they're hacking as

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,609
fast as they can to get a product

00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,910
launched to get it

00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:46,680
the features implemented and done so

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,529
that you can get the product in the

00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,430
market make your revenue but they're not

00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:54,630
yet adopting that full open source model

00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,549
and for good reason you know when you're

00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,799
first starting in a new thing and the

00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:02,160
new industry it's all about moving as

00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:04,829
fast as possible and when we saw

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,519
everybody doing the same thing obviously

00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:10,769
linares model of collaboration and

00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:13,249
defragmentation of these spaces makes a

00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:15,720
lot of sense so we started looking at

00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:17,789
what are the open source components

00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,630
being used on these devices and there's

00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:25,289
you know probably three or four major

00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:28,369
open source real-time os's that are out

00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:32,430
there that have a pretty long history of

00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:35,789
developers and projects there's IP

00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,859
stacks multiple IP stacks multiple TLS

00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:41,190
implementations you know as you look at

00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:43,049
what a stack of software is for the iot

00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,150
space every single one of those

00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:47,279
components in that stack picture has

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,950
five or six implementations out there

00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:53,009
and it's really spreading the resources

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,779
thin across the entire market and I

00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:57,630
think it's even i could will say it's

00:40:54,779 --> 00:41:00,450
even slowing down fragment tape slowing

00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:03,119
down innovation in the iot space you

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:05,460
know it could take with a grain of salt

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,900
all of the the market analysis stuff

00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,059
about how many devices and how much

00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,489
money is going to make but every year

00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:14,220
it's it's in the future right that the

00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:15,660
this is the space is happening well it's

00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,119
supposed to happen 2000m team is

00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,489
supposed to happen 2018-19 you can see

00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,140
that kind of movement along there and i

00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:24,509
think in large part is due to the fact

00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,549
that people are spending their time on

00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:28,589
these commodity problems that they're

00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:32,549
not spending the time on on innovation

00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:34,619
they're all doing the same hacking on an

00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:37,230
IP stack to make sure that it works in

00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:40,589
that in the small footprint with all the

00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:43,319
latest ipv6 features and everything that

00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:45,450
goes into that it's very complicated the

00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:50,640
other parallel to the embedded Linux

00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:52,890
world is that when so back then when

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,599
people started using Linux in the

00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,360
embedded States in bed space there is

00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,150
kind of two things

00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:01,120
that that drove the the adoption just it

00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:03,730
to oversimplify one is that all these

00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,950
embedded things were now connected to a

00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,640
network of some sort so it no longer

00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:12,730
made sense to rely on a proprietary

00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:17,530
network stack it made sense to leverage

00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:19,300
a collaborative development of the IP

00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,490
stack and not have all these people

00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,680
doing proprietary ones and the other

00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:25,570
part was security is security becomes

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,530
important that also you can no longer

00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:33,850
rely on a single vendor to give you the

00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:37,840
complete closed source implementation

00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:39,430
and just rely on on that one development

00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,870
team to fix all your security problems

00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,510
and identify all the security problems

00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:45,370
makes much as Jeff pointed out in one of

00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,960
the key things in in this space in

00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,270
general for security is code review so

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,810
the more open source things we have the

00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:55,810
more eyes are on it the more you get so

00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:57,820
that that leads to why we started light

00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:01,390
and are focusing on some of the

00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:05,200
microcontroller projects and in that

00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:07,270
software space so I don't know if

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,000
everybody was able to attend on Monday

00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:14,310
but we had in the introduction to three

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,410
of these projects open sourcing

00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:19,630
executives and other pieces of stack in

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,210
there so we had an intro to Zephyr we

00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:25,060
had an intro to embed then we had to

00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:26,620
intro to minut and all three of these

00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,850
have some very interesting and great

00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,100
technologies and we're going to be

00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:35,020
working with them in in light in some

00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:37,660
fashion today we have a mini comp that

00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,420
joyed mentioned so today is the cortex-m

00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,770
software mini comp and we've got three

00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,840
sessions there the first one is in

00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:50,080
device model system model so how can we

00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:53,470
quickly get the not only our members but

00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,390
hardware in general ported to open

00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,700
source projects that we're working on in

00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:59,800
particular zephyr and the other ones I

00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,560
mentioned so there's some interesting

00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,480
ideas we have there we're leveraging our

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,670
experience from from the Linux and

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,560
cortex a side we think we can bring some

00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,250
of that that knowledge to the cortex-m

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,370
side of things

00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:16,930
and really make help standardize the way

00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:20,680
you port to these SOC cortex-m sses the

00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:23,350
second one is in building packaging so

00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,630
another problem space in in this area is

00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:28,360
that it with all these open source

00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:31,360
projects uh they're discrete components

00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:33,640
there's not really a distro there's not

00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,220
really an embedded type thing where you

00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,020
can have a package management system be

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,940
able to pull from these different open

00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,760
source projects get it all built and

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,010
integrated together in the like we're

00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,500
used to in the in the linux world most

00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:51,010
of the developers in the space are

00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:55,000
either on Windows or Mac in an IDE and

00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:57,190
they're used to having a single stack of

00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,040
software provided from a from a vendor

00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:02,860
that there that they work on so to move

00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,960
to this model of leveraging open source

00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:07,060
software in the OEMs and the actual

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,060
developers we have a lot of work to do

00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,530
to get us to the point where that that

00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,540
stuff can be leveraged like we're we're

00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:15,900
so used to on Linux so that's another

00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:19,170
big area that lights going to focus on

00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,460
to really Drive this collaboration

00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:24,760
defragmentation of the market and allow

00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:26,920
more developers to do things faster and

00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,650
then the third session we have and the

00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,420
mini conf is around security and

00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,480
obviously you know you're just

00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:36,370
presentation that the it's absolutely

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,860
critical that we talk about security

00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,730
from the beginning of what we're doing

00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,970
it's not going to be something that's

00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:45,280
left to the last so hopefully you guys

00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,390
can attend some of those sessions and

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,210
hear what we're working on and

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:51,190
contribute it's a mini comp style mini

00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,960
conference style session so we expect

00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:57,550
lots of interaction and discussion and

00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,150
we're pretty excited about that I think

00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:04,150
that's oh look there's no one more thing

00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:09,250
we have I think Joe had mentioned this

00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:11,170
to in his slides there's an embed the

00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,970
embed guys from arm have some hardware

00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,680
in our hacking room in the White hacking

00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:19,030
room I think they're going to set it up

00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,650
this this afternoon and then people more

00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,570
than welcome to come by and get a little

00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,810
intro to it play on the boards do

00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,850
hacking on it and then there's a session

00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:30,520
tonight that they're hosting I think

00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:32,950
with pizza and games and stuff where

00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,020
they're going to kind of focus on

00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:39,310
answering questions and playing with the

00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:47,560
hardware thank you hopefully to miss

00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:49,570
anything was supposed to say okay

00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,500
everyone grab some coffee outside have a

00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,850
great day we'll see you back here

00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,850
