development bomb which is a newcomer on

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:12,000
the 96 ball family so before going to

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,650
the details of this ball and they will

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,170
be hands-on session or later this

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,109
morning I like to introduce little

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,789
mediatek even overview of the company

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,369
where we are coming from

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:28,740
what's our mobile solution today is a

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:32,330
little about mobile and why we did bring

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,330
this ball to the community

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:39,510
so first let's stop with immediate echo

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,059
volume so MediaTek is a pretty large

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:47,030
company our light copter is based in

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:52,379
Taiwan we are more than 15,000 employees

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:54,899
our product segments pretty wide so we

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,440
are covering mobile communication we

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:04,170
have a large market share in mobile

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,180
phones feature phones tablets some crop

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,340
book has been announced also so talking

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,210
a little about upstream code we have

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,670
done it with one of our ship set earlier

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:19,229
we are big in home entertainment digital

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:22,080
TV on the cold storage players and we

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,330
have all the various market networking

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,810
so a lot of waters at home are using

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,240
media tech solution and I would be

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,100
wearables and things like that so

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,829
revenue is the run like seven billion

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,600
switch pretty big and we expect 2016 to

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,670
be better so if we look at the different

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,079
segments we are covering we are at a

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,210
leading position several of this segment

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,619
you can see a good synergy with actually

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,210
what Lena is doing in two different

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,100
groups

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:59,880
covering home covering mobile covering a

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:02,009
yachties today has its app on mobile so

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:10,069
will focus about smartphone so in

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:14,120
smartphone we are second position and so

00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:15,890
let's say 2015 it's about like

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,930
founded millions you need to give you a

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,200
scale of what we are shipping into those

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,690
smartphone business and we expect 2016

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,569
to be even better so that's kind of like

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:33,260
the biggest business that we have in MDK

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:37,519
and that's from here that will talk

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:43,480
today about what we do and what we can

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:47,690
bring new so to get that type of

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:51,430
performance on the market shipment we

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,109
created a business model which was not

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,260
created out of open source it's kind of

00:02:54,109 --> 00:03:00,799
like almost the opposite so we created a

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:03,890
turnkey solution and we look at large

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,480
volume business and we'll have a

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,109
complete solution between adware and

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,810
software that is very much a very very

00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:13,840
wide to go to collection as fast as

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,120
possible

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,150
so when we did notify this large market

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,790
such as smartphone business will create

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:28,160
some of the most advanced SOC in the

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:31,310
industry and our idea is to put some

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,810
time the most processing possible in the

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,349
form factor where we'll be like

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,169
smartphone has very limited thermal

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,760
dissipation capability so on it's

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,019
sometimes difficult to get as much

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,150
performance as you would like

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,069
so we work very hard also to integrate

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,709
at the same time low power of technology

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:53,299
in your architecture we'll come back

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:56,419
later to for example why Custer would

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:58,519
create this very advanced SOC and we are

00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:01,010
adding multimedia function

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,299
it's very premium function you are

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,989
seeing all these segments that we are

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:09,109
covering so sometimes we leverage IP and

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,030
like 4k video we are doing set a box so

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,829
4k video is kind of easy for us to

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,959
integrate in mobile phone when it makes

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:20,750
sense we take it in mobile phones and

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,789
one differentiation is like we are also

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,240
a leader in connectivity so we have all

00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:28,090
the technology we have a modem what-mon

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,150
modem if you have seen with

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:36,430
li we are trying to also scale out of

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:38,979
Asia we launched LG x powerful that will

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:43,510
be covered in US by Sprint

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:46,240
so adding CDMA mode we have all the type

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,460
of Wi-Fi if it's mobile phone it's

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,680
probably a simple Wi-Fi if you go to

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,650
rotters then we'll go to a four by four

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,729
NC type of Wi-Fi so we keep investing in

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,060
this type of technology

00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:00,729
we'll have Bluetooth we'll have GPS

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:09,490
we're a very attractive GPS solution for

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:13,090
your wearables device so if I focus on

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:16,960
mobile platform our premium brand is

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:22,680
called EU só EU is coming from Helios

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,680
the god of Suns from the Greek mythology

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:31,360
in healio we have two series the X rays

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,389
is the most performant for extreme

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,720
performances and the P series is more

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:42,430
mainstream it's like very efficient in

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,410
power the latest that has been announced

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,229
at Mobile World Congress earlier this

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:52,360
year was the p20 it's not shipping yet

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:55,479
but x20 shipping since April and you can

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,360
find it in phones mostly in Asia so far

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:01,599
so we will be like no Aiko made you show

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,789
me and so you can think this technology

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:06,460
is not even six months old some

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:10,690
commercial product and we like to bring

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,150
this technology to the mass which is in

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:16,599
the current business model of donkey

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,970
it's impossible even if we have like

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:23,470
large number of employees fifteen

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:25,510
thousand if we want to create new market

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,030
support different customer where the

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,610
scale is pretty low volume compared to

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,240
what we do in this main twin smartphone

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:38,289
segment it's impossible so we need a new

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:43,050
type of model so that we can bring this

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:43,050
technology outside of the standard model

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,590
if I go about a little more detail on

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:56,860
explaining what it brings bring so when

00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,100
we look at like all the ship set that we

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:04,150
add and what we'll be doing testing one

00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:07,300
to bring to community to have new

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:11,410
emerging markets rapport new ideas new

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,840
developers working on advanced SOC

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:17,380
technology but we're cellphone is not

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:23,830
using some time outside of the box

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:26,530
software so we try to look at which one

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,270
we could differentiate and actually

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,539
makes sense to us because that was our

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,560
leading technology and if we go to the

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:34,900
luan

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,970
we have some very low-end sheet set we

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,639
just have a lot of competition with no

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,740
differentiation so explained he was the

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,800
chip where we think we can bring

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,220
differentiation to a community and try

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,680
to support it over some open standard so

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,630
x20 is integrating for the first time in

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,720
the industry to try cluster technology

00:07:52,630 --> 00:08:00,789
with the core architecture we have a 72

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,690
also so it's the one of the most

00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:07,720
advanced mv8 platform that you can find

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:10,599
because it's a very extensive computing

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:15,099
a variable inside it cannot go without

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:19,150
working a lot on how you can make it

00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:22,240
opening with low power so this TriCaster

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:25,479
technology was designed to get all the

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,389
cpu a variable in the little package in

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:33,250
the thermal environment challenge device

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:36,099
and so we strike roster we are about

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:39,690
saving 50% when it's optimized on our

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:42,789
software over a big little architecture

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,410
so that's where it's interesting to to

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,940
bring this type of idea and see how

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:52,300
after you could you leverage it we are

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,860
also providing a very high end GPU so

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,300
it's like my 8880 so if you have

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,620
anything about graphics and

00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,620
thing then it could be interesting

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:05,230
connectivity by default so we'll have

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,730
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS which is

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,510
interesting if you have something that

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,060
you are trying to do mapping outside for

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,600
differentiation will have a premium

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:19,779
camera feature with integrated ice P so

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,950
up to 25 megapixels is supported on our

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:25,750
ISP and that's something when I were

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,820
later to the X when I bought that we

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,670
want to bring also as feature available

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,480
to community compared to kind of like

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:39,850
and our base USB webcam it can bring you

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,519
a better visual input capability video

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,430
as I mentioned from our IP leverage you

00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,950
can do play 4k playback 4k record we

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:51,940
support HDR so parts you have an idea

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:53,290
about how to do video technology some

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,140
application and you will like to

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,700
leverage that high performance computing

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,579
and specially in graphics cannot go

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,260
without high bandwidth memory so it's

00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:04,480
not just about we are providing 2

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,610
gigabyte of memory but you need some

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,950
density of memory but you need also the

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,760
performances so we are bringing a PDF

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:16,120
screen 1866 data rate so which should

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:20,260
cover enough when you need memory

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,570
bandwidth especially in graphics so

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,770
power we are if you are designing

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,660
something which is parented battery

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,170
supplied then it's an interesting

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,810
platform depending of your use case but

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,730
it's a robot with a solar panel well

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:41,980
sometime you have to save the maximum of

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,750
energy then you can balance between the

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,800
course that you are trying to use and

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:53,709
perhaps be doing lower task when you are

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:57,730
not enough on patricide so I skipped one

00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:59,800
item here wanted to keep it for the nx20

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,560
is using mobile phone so obviously it

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,079
doesn't equate it modem it's a Walkman

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,959
modem so we can support all carriers

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,410
around the world when it's certified

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:15,839
does support auntie cats

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:18,910
so today we are not reporting this as

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:22,149
unknowns actually development platform

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,610
but we are working on the idea on how to

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,680
bring that to the community because we

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,490
are seeing a lot of interest also in

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,769
China of customers that say I want to

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,990
have connectivity I want to be connected

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,360
I want to do this device but it's not

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,850
only inside yeah yes you can have your

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,759
Wi-Fi in your house but when you start

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,439
going outside there is no more Wi-Fi so

00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,839
perhaps you need energy you need this

00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:49,329
robot that is LT and GPS

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,810
so that's bringing some differentiation

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:55,720
that we are working on and on the future

00:11:52,810 --> 00:12:03,939
release would like to bring these modern

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:05,620
capabilities so what's new so today for

00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:07,480
the first time I clean our Kinect

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,709
would like to announce like the

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,380
availability of the new extra heat

00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:18,970
development Bob part of the 96 bot

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:24,009
consumer edition and it does come with

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:26,050
Android it's it's coming from our X 20

00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:29,050
radius design so again this was a donkey

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:34,569
model so we are for the Roman purpose

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:39,250
making it on an open standard and we are

00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:42,790
contributing to expand the possibilities

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,399
of choice for the customers developers

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,829
that would like to select one of the 96

00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,300
ball and the ponding of you need then

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:53,339
you can find some differentiation that

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,339
are here with directs to any platform

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,870
but as I mentioned at the beginning with

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,689
all our segments we have also healthy

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:04,089
and wide ecosystem especially in Asia we

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:08,829
have ODM Hartnell's that builds product

00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:10,930
and in large volume so what we want to

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,750
offer also here is the path to

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,120
production but some of you have an idea

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,009
from your prototype you say that's a

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,199
great idea but actually I need to put it

00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,970
to the market and now to make it to the

00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:27,220
market with like

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:29,350
 ball locusts price and how I make

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,050
even I know somebody that knows how to

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:36,700
build how to test for position this is

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:40,620
another level so then we can bring our

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,620
partners to help you to do that

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,060
so why reinvent the wheel so sorry I was

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,250
talking about it

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,840
there are things when we go to new pens

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,700
and we didn't want to create something

00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,880
from mediatek and start reading

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:58,450
something so we look at Linares the

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,770
opportunity to do that and we partner up

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:10,150
with a shaman to build this 96 ball X 20

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:13,450
development ball after mine is based out

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:20,650
of China so it's a web of like 2,000

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:26,610
employees mobile software leader and so

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,610
they will talk later today on the X 20

00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:35,740
so without your mine as partner now we

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:39,490
are capable of addressing needs so X 20

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,650
if you are let's say small volume

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,450
customer you talk to media tech and you

00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,090
say I have this idea but X 20 I would

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,830
like to do a project they will not even

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,710
answer you because it doesn't make sense

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,850
it will be too much support with also

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:55,870
money we are capable of addressing

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,150
through 96 board this new market

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:02,680
emerging market new ideas advanced

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:05,650
technology so will provide this platform

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:09,670
to open community maker developers we

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:14,050
want to address new vertical markets so

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:16,120
point-of-sales we are seeing for example

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,930
point of sale that are mobile that ask

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:23,070
mark who need also connected work where

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,660
the wireless modem would make sense

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,370
modems with more you need more

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,680
performances in artificial intelligence

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,170
so the older CPU computing that were

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,140
offering also will be a good

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,680
differentiation smart signage we also

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,430
work

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,860
with partners so make sure that we can

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:46,120
support a different type of camera on

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:52,690
the native media interface payment VR

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:54,790
and cigarette so I don't want to go in

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:58,180
details in all the specification of the

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:03,580
board you can find it on ninety-six

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:05,620
board organization also the DeCaro that

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,510
were supporting so it's plenty of

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,930
processing power that you can have

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:13,360
access to through swipe caster so it's

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,070
not about really using can you get ten

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,680
cross at the same time doesn't make

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,510
release and it's all you can use each of

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,920
the cluster at the right time depending

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:25,540
of your loading you will have tons of

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:32,589
GPU processing also with mallet ELAP

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:33,790
high bandwidth and again so gps is an

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,399
interesting differentiation on the

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,320
conversion but for connectivity we want

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,029
to do a next on it version where we'll

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,010
bring wireless modem here and other

00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:48,220
differentiation so we are working to

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,920
enable on the high-speed connector some

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,140
Mickey sensors so that you can have

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,570
access to a very nice video input

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,250
instead of being limited to the USB

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:04,990
webcam which is sometimes low in

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:12,640
resolution and low in framerate so the

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:15,429
development board terrible year so it's

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,809
the standard nothing to say much we

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,120
accept extra knees like

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:23,890
package-on-package so will come with the

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,500
two gigabyte on stack on top and all the

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:32,800
integrity connectivity with GPS until we

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:35,080
have the extended version so today you

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,290
get your board you can just go to 96

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:43,420
block org and tip I will redirect you to

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:46,090
the out remain open agua forum and you

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,430
will have domestic and overseas by from

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,400
there so after man will be able to ship

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:55,460
with also some specific need that you

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,790
will need there will be information from

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:02,240
there there will be some test case so

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,530
you can get on on both side to get the

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,260
information if you need anything

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,360
specific from after mine there is also

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:15,770
an email contact so don't hesitate to

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:18,230
contact them by email and so that's it

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,290
so we'll have more information in the

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:32,240
workshop at 11:15 and it will be hosted

00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:34,070
by after mine now thank you okay just

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,840
one more note until we go into break

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,190
which is outside the room here everyone

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,290
should have a connect guy that comes

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,200
with your badge and inside the connect

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:44,150
guide there is a connect puzzle and Dave

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,800
Piggott who is our puzzle champ puzzle

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,290
creating champion for those of you

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,000
who've been to connect before know this

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,770
is a contest there'll be a prize of

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,750
really good prize at the end of the week

00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,060
for someone who can figure out the

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,950
solution to this puzzle and he is quite

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,380
good at creating interesting puzzles as

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,880
I think we know from past experience so

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,120
I might want to take a look at that see

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,920
what you can figure out and that's it

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,970
we're gonna head into break now and I

00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,970
