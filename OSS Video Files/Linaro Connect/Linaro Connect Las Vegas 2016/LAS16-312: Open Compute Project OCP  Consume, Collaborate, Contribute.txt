	00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:14,969
so thank you all so much for coming some

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,680
of you were here if there's some new

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,400
faces we're here we're used to be the

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,000
community manager at linaro and so being

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,859
back here today is like a it's fun and

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm kind of happy to be back it's good

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,250
to see all the changes that have

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,689
happened and where you all are going and

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,579
what you've added in the last three and

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,370
a half years and I want to talk to you

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,570
all about how you can collaborate with

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,570
us come on in

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,660
so what is oh so CP for those who don't

00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:55,090
know where a 501 C 6 organization that

00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:58,480
was a filmed founded in 2011 we're

00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:02,320
focused on the data center ecosystem our

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,030
original founders were fat Facebook

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
Rackspace and Intel about combined three

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,259
of those names but didn't wouldn't sound

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,509
very nice we have about 55 members now

00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,640
and we're actually since the time this

00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:17,770
slide was made until today we actually

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,680
have about 167 members now and about 33

00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,990
members a week our current board members

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,380
Facebook Rackspace Intel Microsoft and

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,539
Goldman Sachs 52 design contributions 11

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,000
different companies and we have more

00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:32,649
than like a team or they're in the

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,140
pipeline being reviewed right now and

00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:38,950
one of the foot when the groups of focus

00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,080
on later is our networking group because

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,110
you guys have LNG and we have our server

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,240
group and you guys have your enterprise

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,600
group so there's some overlap in those

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,520
areas focus not only on greenfield but

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,640
brownfield data centers as well there's

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,799
some guess misconceptions around that

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,890
we're solely focused on greenfield and

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,320
the 21 inch open rack we both we have 19

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,490
into a contributions as well and

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,160
networking gear and while we we do have

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:13,090
our technology focus and you'll see in

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,100
another slide our industry focus and our

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,690
technology verticals are our industry

00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:22,329
verticals and technology verticals to

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:24,250
form 9 top-level groups like someone

00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:26,140
says a wife you're doing open hardware

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,299
why don't you do all things open

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:33,070
hardware we're focused solely in near

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:35,140
and around the data center so as you can

00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,370
see our initial focus was leveraged by

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:42,010
the Facebook designs and and companies

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,290
such as Goldman Sachs and Rackspace and

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,859
others leverage those designs and made

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,690
changes themselves we now have like I

00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:53,319
was saying over four thousand engineers

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,720
that participate in our organization and

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,540
we have

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,830
again nine top-level projects we have

00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,360
our project groups and we have our

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,140
incubation committee rank you Batian

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,580
committee is the committee that is

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,660
responsible for voting in every

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,950
contribution that we have and so we we

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,560
usually all of our hardware

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,820
contributions are governed by either the

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,010
owf license which is the open web

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,930
foundation license or the two licenses

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,380
that we've written we have a hardware

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,250
license that's based on the apache style

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,710
open-source software license and the

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,970
license that's based on the GPL v2

00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:30,230
licensing so we're moving beyond the

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,440
facebooks of the world in the

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,150
Microsoft's of the world we have other

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,120
telco financial hosting markets and

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,570
we're looking we're always being

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,360
approached to look at more industry

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:46,190
markets as well what are we looking on

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,230
for going forward not only are we

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,630
focusing on the hardware ecosystem

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,040
around the data center and hardware is

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,810
great and opening up the hardware is

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,820
great but at the end of the day and to

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,080
drive adoption its will my software work

00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,459
on your hardware so now we're looking on

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,330
driving both the innovation piece and

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:08,060
the adoption piece and making sure that

00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,340
software is working on our hardware so

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,390
we're enabling a software ecosystem as

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,609
well some of those future initiatives

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,250
include in an interactive web portal so

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:22,820
think about like a Zappos website for

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,130
Open Compute hardware so I like shoes so

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,229
I want to you know can search colors and

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,360
types and all that good stuff and then

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:32,810
you know we're going to focus on user

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,419
validation creation of that support

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,830
shared support ecosystems in that or

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:38,570
technologies in that we don't want to

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,130
reinvent the wheel we want to partner

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,930
with other groups we don't need to

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,940
create a whole other certification layer

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,729
when there's other groups that do that

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,919
better than we do and again creation of

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:52,880
the software ecosystem so that's sort of

00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:56,419
the the overview there and I talked

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,220
about how it all began when so any

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:03,460
questions so far I'm going to dive

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,460
pretty deep into some of the stuff but

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:15,340
no so that's them that's very near and

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,470
dear to my heart there and we're working

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,540
on it it's just a searchable database so

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,190
in order for you'll see when we talk

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,200
about how something becomes open

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,330
computer we could how someone can brand

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,440
their product is that we compute one of

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,940
the things I have to do is give us the

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,870
orderable skews it's based on the

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,360
specification we have the design files

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,860
we and then for those orderable skews we

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,570
have you know who is selling it that

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,120
kind sepsis you could go in and say I

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,220
want all open compute servers that fit

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,290
into a nineteen ng iraq i want to see

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,620
all open compute servers that go into a

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,660
21 inch open rack be to format or I want

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,400
to see all the OCS contributions or I

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,140
want to see bear life and you can search

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,300
that way and it'll come up and tell you

00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:00,540
where you can go and get them right

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,919
right because we as a foundation or not

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,450
we don't manufacture anything and we

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,480
don't sell anything we just enable the

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:12,400
ecosystem the innovation ecosystem so I

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,260
mean so in 2009 Facebook started looking

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,600
at how they wanted to redo their data

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:20,890
centers and how they wanted to look at

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,979
being more efficient and in 2011 as I

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,490
mentioned Rackspace Intel and Goldman

00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:29,320
Sachs base intel on facebook

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,060
incorporated the foundation they invited

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,070
goldman sachs and auntie Becca shimon to

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,669
join the board so those are the five

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:39,100
founding board members in 2013 microsoft

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,900
joined the board in 2014 Frank

00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,770
frankovsky one of the original founders

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:49,180
and masterminds behind the open rack and

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:51,669
Facebook's newest data centers left

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,340
facebook to form his own company and

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,590
which was later bought by sony and so

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,169
Frank moved into an individual board

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,790
member position and jason taylor from

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:04,800
facebook moved into the facebook board

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,640
seat and so there were five

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,349
organizational board members and two

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:14,910
individual board members and then so now

00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,910
we have those seven seats

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,480
so if you take a look at the way our

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,440
foundation is structured it looks a

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,600
little bit different than the way salen

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,500
ro is structured but you can see that

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:33,290
the gray boxes the board incubation

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,980
committee and our projects those are all

00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:39,620
volunteers so none of those are paid

00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:44,000
positions by the foundation the folks in

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,560
green are the paid positions and right

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,760
now Facebook helps us with our sales

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,230
support and supporting if somebody wants

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,360
to have more information about the

00:07:51,230 --> 00:08:01,370
facebook skews and how to adopt them and

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:02,630
how to use them yes kid can you sorry I

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,210
didn't mean to make you the mic runner

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,970
oh it's just some because is a google

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:11,510
and amazon other this company is a

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,620
member of this google is cokely's google

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,700
and facebook right now and i'll talk

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,120
about this a little bit later are

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,950
collaborating on a 48 volt open rack v2

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,100
standards that they're creating right

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:27,020
now so we have a lot of collaboration

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:30,320
between those organizations so you can

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,840
see that again the green the green is

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,910
the employees the gray is the volunteer

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,070
and right now the sales support staff is

00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,380
currently staffed by Facebook but any

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,860
board member company could help with you

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,600
know with that so I often tell people

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,750
for those of you are familiar with the

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,760
open rack that as lean and vanity free

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,400
as those racks are we operate at the

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,589
foundation level very lean as well we

00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:02,570
all wear many hats any questions about

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:04,010
about this so we r IC members and our

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,010
project leads work very closely together

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,600
and as you can see we do have the nine

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,000
top level project certification

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,400
interoperability data center hardware

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,620
management hpc networking open rack

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,839
server storage and telco so those are

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,170
all of our 9 top-level projects now

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,520
within two of those projects networking

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,860
storage we do have some sub projects

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,030
that i'll switch over to a webpage here

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,030
in a minute and show you some of those

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,530
you can see the technology verticals i

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,020
was referring to that I was telling

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,730
anyway technology verticals so we have

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,380
networking server storage and open rack

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,210
which if you think about how Iraq is

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,100
divided when you think of the network

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,810
you can think of compute you think of

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,550
the storage and then you think of rack

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,480
and power that's our technology

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:53,550
verticals and all of our other groups

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,140
are industry verticals that have the

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:59,040
potential to cross all of the other

00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:01,230
projects so none of like well we

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,520
interchange certification and compliance

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,530
because again we don't want to be the

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,030
certification experts when there's other

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,140
people out there to do the certification

00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,210
so we just want to make sure that it's

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,130
compliant and fits in the racks and does

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,580
what it says it's going to do but you

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,920
can see that we're not a linaro is the

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,350
same way it used to be any open and

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,500
collaborative organization is not a step

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,330
one step two step three process it's a

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,340
lattice and you pick a point that where

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,020
you want to come in and you intersect at

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,820
other areas if you're kind of turn this

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,430
just a little bit think of how lattice

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,400
works someone could come in through like

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,680
the telco group and have a contribution

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,480
that could be a full rack solution which

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,340
would cross all of those could be a

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,900
networking solution which was just the

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,570
networking group and the telco group

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,100
would collaborate on that so it depends

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,770
on where you want to be and how you want

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,050
to collaborate as to which project you

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,060
want to come into that you'll see that I

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,890
have an axe tricked by networking and

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,470
server and that's because I wanted to

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,060
show that there there is some overlap in

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,760
the way we organize ourselves and the

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,260
way you won't have been organized to in

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,380
that you have your networking group and

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:11,550
we and your enterprise group and we have

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:18,170
networking and server any questions so

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:18,170
far yep

00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:26,560
we will deal with overlapped projects

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,019
you know maybe you have the networking

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,660
and server you and price and also have

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:34,509
the similar projecting in tactical so

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,310
how do doing this all apps we just

00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:38,529
schedule calls and by everybody to the

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,149
call and pick which mailing list

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,579
everybody's going to jump on and discuss

00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:44,860
it and then you know so it may start in

00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:46,629
the telco group but need to go over to

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,519
the other projects and so sometimes

00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,649
everybody will be invited to the telco

00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,009
mailing list to collaborate there

00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,689
sometimes it'll be well this is more

00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:57,639
server centric so we'll go move it over

00:11:55,689 --> 00:12:00,250
to the server group to give them more

00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,319
opportunities to do that and we just

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,060
make sure everybody who needs to be part

00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:06,819
of it gets invited and has the

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,800
opportunity to participate ok maybe I

00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:10,629
think maybe sometimes the different

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,870
requirements from the technical anza and

00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:18,250
the price will occur maybe you know for

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:21,910
the same networking aspect so so they

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,380
will do this in separator we have

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,240
project leads that are they're experts

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,360
in all of those industries and so if

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,310
it's the server side like for our server

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,410
leads for example we have one of our

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,380
project leads is from Dale the other

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,449
project lead is from Microsoft and so we

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,949
have the engineering capabilities you

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:41,110
know to look at you know those

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:42,670
enterprise needs as well as and in our

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,709
community when you look at four thousand

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,930
engineers participating we have like

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:49,660
experts across industry so we just

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,459
figure out who needs to do and those who

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,170
are typically wanting to join and

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:55,630
wanting to be part of it jump into the

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,930
conversation so it's that make that

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:02,199
answer question yeah any other question

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:06,970
yeah but you're gonna ask me a question

00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:09,459
I was getting excited for because this

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,430
is just one example these right here are

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:14,050
the networking group specifications and

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,059
design contributions that have been

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,170
accepted not even the ones that are in

00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:18,759
the pipeline there's probably another

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,100
ten or twelve said they're in the

00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,399
pipeline but these are just the ones

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,350
that have been accepted so far so we

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,569
have the specification and designs and

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,310
if you go to our networking wiki page

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:34,500
you'll be able to

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:39,970
have full access to those yep three

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:42,130
where's the other one see really is

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,100
there just two microphones in here yeah

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,890
okay so to clarify so you've got you've

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,330
got a list of submitted accepted design

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:54,339
contributions there yeah one from a

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,839
standpoint wait somebody submits it does

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,029
that mean anybody in the world can go

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,580
build one of those designs they have

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,260
license to do that and then to what is

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,240
your market share do you have you guys

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,650
you guys track your success based on

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,839
that how many what percentage of the

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,480
networking market is based on OCPD nope

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,400
okay now our sales channel like we have

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,070
a VP of channel who works with all of

00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,110
our suppliers but the odm OEM and

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:21,250
vendors face is so competitive our

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:23,710
vendors may say that we have you know X

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,720
number of servers deployed in the

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:29,070
financial area we may have X number of

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,810
you know racks that are deployed in the

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,760
oil and gas industry we have whatever it

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,940
happens to be right but we they won't

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,100
ever give up their their names to say

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,320
this is how many from this particular

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,210
company because it mean it is and that's

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,600
to protect their interests as well we're

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:49,930
not here to be in the sales business but

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:55,300
we're in the enablement business the to

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:57,520
remove the vendor lock-in if you will to

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,220
create the white box spaces you know to

00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,760
drive innovation and put the power back

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,320
into the consumer into the adopter you

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,910
know no longer is it a vendor driven you

00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,950
have to accept the specs is where you

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,180
have to accept this for example

00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,850
networking gear you got except the

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,370
switch the way I'm doing it or you don't

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,580
get it right so we've taken all the

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:24,089
mystery away and so here you go so put

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:29,950
so it's now a adopter driven ecosystem

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:31,120
make sense yeah now given that and the

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,510
work that you all are doing in the

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,490
networking space and you'll see most of

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,680
our we now have contributions from the

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,630
x86 architecture and we have open Power

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,560
Architecture what we don't have is

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,540
anything on the arm

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,850
space so we'd love to see some arm

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,050
contributions come in as it relates to

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,360
the data center so if it's something

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:53,200
that will fit in Iraq monitor the rack

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,880
or manage the rack you know anything

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,650
like that we'd love to see those

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,570
contributions come in and see these two

00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:02,620
communities you can collaborate across

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,930
that space I talked to knew Larry with

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,300
calving them today about that because

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,730
they do with thunder X surprisingly

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,120
enough it just hasn't been contributed

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,980
Thunder X they make their reference

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,860
architecture freely available to folks

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,680
like penguin or gigabit and those folks

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,290
and so penguin does have a sled that

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,570
Thunder X fits in that slides into the

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,250
v2 rack that is you know makes it

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,900
powered by the bus bar however it's not

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,960
being contributed so you won't see it on

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,940
our server with so we'll have to work so

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,870
working together with you all in this

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,310
community with with cavion you know with

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,020
some of the folks who are enabling the

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,790
software on top of these solutions

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,770
because they want to be able to market

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,470
that their software runs on a Open

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:50,310
Compute solution a little full court

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:53,410
press to get people to sort of

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:58,690
contribute there any other questions

00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:00,220
about this piece of it yes no maybe it's

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,839
very weird for me be sitting down

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:07,179
talking like I want to get up and walk

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:09,459
around so again here's our top level

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:12,520
projects Cassie to the group's have an

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:14,439
IC representative oh sorry sorry kind of

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,929
a quick question yeah can you talk more

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,270
about your certification process what

00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,520
that entails so we don't certify

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,140
anything we don't we manage the

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,030
partnerships that do that for example

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,550
we're not going to certify that Red Hat

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,110
OpenStack works on a particular sku Red

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:33,480
Hat is going to certify that it works on

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:36,340
a particular sku if canonical wanted to

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,810
certify that snappy matter of fact they

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,480
do that snappy runs on all of our

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,890
contributed switches they would do that

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,110
and then they would link to it they

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,510
would make their test criteria public

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,730
and we would create a database of which

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,670
software works on you know which open

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,770
compute components and so we we that

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,740
group actually just helps manage that

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,510
relationship or

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,980
so what we need to do and how it you

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,500
know like we need to talk to this

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,670
particular group and that kind of you

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,290
know that kind of stuff but we don't do

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,500
that we don't do the certification

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:08,840
ourselves okay so is it safe to say oh

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,740
well maybe not done that the value-add

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,460
then for open compute with the

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:20,530
collections or a database of all the

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:23,900
certification done by various vendors

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,460
and they have consumers than have a list

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,470
of they know what works and what

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,679
combination works or doesn't work and

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,210
you all don't do any of the kind of

00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,090
interoperability between hardware

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,429
software testing no we don't and here's

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,309
why when you look across the board you

00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:43,190
know there there's no reason why we as a

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:45,170
small nonprofit entity need you know we

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,740
don't have the engineers on staff for

00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:50,360
the QA expertise on on staff when there

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,429
are many other organizations out there

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,380
that do it much better more efficiently

00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:57,620
and part of their membership would be to

00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:00,860
help you know with those efforts a good

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,600
example we have UNH the University of

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,550
New Hampshire their interoperability lab

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,790
works very closely with our networking

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:10,280
group they have a lab or consortium that

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,020
we're part of and we partner with them

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,300
and anything going through a networking

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,970
group has the ability to go through you

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,520
NHS interoperability lab and we vetted

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,380
that lab and and approved what they're

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,030
doing in that lab and so we just work

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,980
you know work with them and match up the

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,530
resources and that sort of stuff matter

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,500
of fact one of the project leads for the

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:33,500
CNI group is one of the leads at the

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:37,429
interoperability lab at UNH so the

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:40,130
community elects those who are experts

00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:42,410
in their fields to help drive most of

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,850
that stuff and this is new so a lot of

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,950
the stuff that you all are hearing about

00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,620
today is new stuff that we're rolling

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,690
out and like that searchable database it

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,059
rolls it'll go live before the end of

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,160
the year it's in beta right now and

00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,900
we're testing it out and you'll see some

00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,850
of the criteria in order to submit here

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,740
a little bit later so any other question

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:06,530
so what was going to say was all of our

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,670
groups have an IC representative name of

00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,110
the project leads

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,170
representative and the project leaves

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,580
are all voted in by the community

00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:17,180
they're not appointed by the foundation

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:20,560
and they're not appointed you know by

00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:24,320
the by the board it's a community-led

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,880
initiative we have our online meetings

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,450
we have our wiki pages are mailing lists

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,800
in a section on the website and each of

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,570
these groups can you know be

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,890
representative at our various events and

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,420
we have several events we have a big

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,970
summit have one a year unfortunately

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:42,050
it's going to be at the same time as

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:44,000
connect next year in March so I'd love

00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:46,250
to see you know people from here there

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,870
but it's just not going to happen we

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,020
have our engineering workshops our next

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,310
one is in London so those of you who are

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,620
near London and would like to come see

00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,320
our engineering workshop it'll be

00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,200
november second in conjunction with the

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,030
dcd event in london we have our

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,590
information days which we roll out when

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,080
we're getting ready to go into a new

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,540
region and that region may not know

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,340
about Open Compute and we have

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,840
information day and invite anyone

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,290
interested in open compute and go

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,360
through how you can get involved and we

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,550
have our success stories we invite

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,550
vendors we invite members women by other

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:25,310
folks to get involved and and see where

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:28,040
their place is in the ecosystem and then

00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:35,810
we have our meetups so any questions

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:38,030
about about this yes no maybe I probably

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,230
don't need to tell you all this because

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,680
you're an open and collaborative

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,750
organization however well your member

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,030
driven organization so you you all have

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,900
members and do they I can't remember

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,850
they get access to your technology

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:55,910
without being a member other than 96

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,410
boards like that's a it's an outlier but

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:01,400
other than that like to access LNG or

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,870
leg or you know do you have to be a

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,240
member to get access to the stuff that's

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:10,550
going on in those groups okay so right

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,450
but not to the you can't provide thought

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,860
leadership and joining okay so in our

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,720
community the communication

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,750
participation is absolutely key

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,550
it can't be like an exclusive group it's

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,470
got to be very inclusive otherwise it

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:27,980
doesn't work there would be no way such

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,690
a small group of people could hurt all

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,100
the cats you know when you're looking at

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,920
all the contributions and you're looking

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,540
at you know 4,000 plus people

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,870
participating across you know nine organ

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,670
I'm groups unless we had very good

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,220
communication and participation across

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:46,550
all of that it gets siloed very quickly

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,110
this doesn't happen and so I'm not going

00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,000
to spend too much time on this piece of

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,190
it but you can see how the board and the

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,980
foundation interacts how that

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,930
communication gets focused out how the

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,190
two groups between our IC and our

00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,690
project leads communicate and then

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:05,060
communicate outward to the rest of the

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:07,850
world and you know one of the things

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,190
that community does marketing builds a

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,720
brand and it's funny no matter what

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,030
event I go to somebody will always ask

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,430
are you marketing and marketing builds

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,360
the brand community empowers the people

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:22,190
so without that empowerment I'm you know

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,750
I'm not just going to like broadcast out

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,670
we're going to give you a lane of

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,380
participation a lane of how you can

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,620
provide thought leadership and guide

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,600
their future of those groups and so that

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,880
open communication the collaboration is

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,710
key to driving the adoption or the

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,200
consumption of open compute and the

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,690
innovation which is the contribution so

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,420
when you have innovation on one side and

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,040
you have the consumption on the other

00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,900
the collaboration if you thought of it

00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,910
as two sides of the coin the

00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,770
collaboration piece is the binding agent

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:55,160
that holds it together if it's too

00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:57,740
lopsided toward adoption or too lopsided

00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,990
toward innovation it won't work it has

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:06,050
to be a balanced effort across those

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:08,270
three initiatives and that transparency

00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,490
transparency how many of you all have

00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,500
been involved in other whether it's an

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,440
open source software group or just an

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,880
open and collaborative group where there

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,410
wasn't a lot of transparent

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,660
communication between those who are in

00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:24,020
charge and those who were those who were

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,990
leading the group versus those who were

00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,510
trying to participate it creates

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,100
this sense of distrust and as long as

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,410
the transparency is there and that

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,780
collaboration is there it builds

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:39,170
participation and it builds trust it

00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,760
with both the those leading the group

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,870
have trust and those wanting to

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,640
participate and those want to

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,070
participate have trust in those leading

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,429
the group and you I know back to I've

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:50,600
done two days we've seen where happened

00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:53,390
wonderful situations and where it didn't

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,480
happen those situations and so these are

00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:58,670
lessons learned from many years and in

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,380
and around not just hardware groups but

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:05,240
software groups as well and then I don't

00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,760
read the slide to you but I'll make

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,730
these available keys to participation in

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,290
what why you want to participate just

00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,390
better insight awareness into the

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,520
community better to position and

00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,980
understand and leverage those solutions

00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,590
and the key to it too is like people go

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,900
all will they get this person gets

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,850
better treatment than I do well

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,240
sometimes people get answers quicker

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,190
because if I know who's calling me and I

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,690
you know I recognize the number or

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,970
recognize the person on the end of the

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,890
email or I know who it is not just me

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,620
but anybody even in this organization if

00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,720
you know who it is you're more likely to

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,850
answer their question quicker than than

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,620
that's human nature and someone you

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,150
don't know because you like I don't know

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,130
this person who are they I don't know

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,380
their company who are they but a company

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,420
who is actively participating in your

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,990
project actively providing thought

00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,970
leadership actively engaging with you

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,520
you know and we've heard of them you

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,890
trust there you trust what they're doing

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,780
and so you're more likely to either pick

00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,550
the phone up and call them back answer

00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,550
their email quicker or when you run into

00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:12,200
them to event at an event to have that

00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,540
hallway track to have that side

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,860
communication and transcend the

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,080
transparent communication and that

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:21,110
collaboration piece of it builds all of

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:25,100
that so any questions or thoughts about

00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:27,370
this piece of it no can't believe you're

00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,370
quiet

00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:33,240
so again many ways to participate we

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,520
have our mailing list which is our first

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,490
line of communication our lowest barrier

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,490
of entry we have our online meetings

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:45,899
with all the projects have we have our

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:48,090
events and we have our if you're in just

00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:50,190
like for here if you you all were at

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,950
another industry event and say there was

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,559
an ocp contribution an arm contribution

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,760
that came in from the linaro community

00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,350
to open computing you're at an industry

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,809
event you say hey we're going to be

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:04,110
talking about our contribution to open

00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:06,570
compute and your you want someone from

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,770
Open Compute in your booth you know it

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,140
would be nice to have them they're right

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,640
and talk about the foundation efforts so

00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,679
we you know we want to know what you're

00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:18,870
doing at the industry events too and how

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,610
that works so we do have some regional

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,960
expansion going on right now we have

00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:27,090
approved communities in Japan and Taiwan

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,610
this year through mid-2017 will bring

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:33,240
canada europe australia new zealand and

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:36,029
korea online and our model surprisingly

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,890
enough is based on the loko teams that

00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,960
all the work we did I have some history

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,730
an adventure community and so the work

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,120
that we did on the charters and stuff

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:47,490
for the loco teams there we've carried a

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,799
lot of that over rough carried a lot of

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,890
that over into the self governance model

00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:54,779
of our regional communities so basically

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,539
the communities follow the criteria to

00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,890
become a regional community when they

00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,870
think they're ready they contact the

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:03,450
foundation we evaluate it and then say

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,159
yes or no and then if we say no we tell

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,020
them what they need to do to say yes

00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,029
then they get logos and other branding

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,279
opportunities to do that so it's a

00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:12,899
self-governing model we just we just

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,789
give the lanes and the guidance for it

00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:23,279
to happen so any questions about what

00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:25,770
I've talked about so far yeah so I tell

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,809
you what this is after lunch in Vegas

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:31,559
and I but everybody here had like a

00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:32,520
crazy night last night right so I'm

00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,370
gonna have to stand and walk around

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,700
handle that cuz I'm it just as tired as

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,700
you all are

00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:43,049
so our membership levels I got asked a

00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,519
lot of questions about this because I

00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:48,070
our membership model is very different

00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,809
than any other nonprofit organization

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:52,419
out there especially around hardware and

00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:55,960
software we're not a pay-to-play model

00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:57,970
and what I mean by that is that to get

00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,919
access to the specifications and designs

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:05,080
to come to our meetings to join the

00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,840
online project meetings to provide

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,659
thought leadership and guidance you do

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,369
not have to be a member anyone any one

00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:14,379
of you could go to our wiki pages in a

00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:16,389
website and see all the information

00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:19,059
there's nothing that that's that's held

00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:21,009
back there's no secret member places or

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,779
or anything like that that wasn't a

00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,659
model that that we wanted to have it

00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:27,789
works for a lot of organizations but we

00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:29,889
wanted to make sure that anyone who

00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,049
wanted to participate regardless of how

00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:34,299
deep their pockets were could so we

00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:36,070
didn't want just tier 1 you know folks

00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:37,779
we have a participate we want to go all

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,789
the way down to the individual level and

00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:41,980
while I'm focused here on the tiered

00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:44,320
membership we do have an individual

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,820
level if you're not associated with

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,249
another organization and you just want

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,230
to join as a member all by yourself and

00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:53,830
not you're not giving credit to your

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:56,710
company we have a free individual level

00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:00,639
and what you'll see is when i get to the

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:03,129
benefits the more time and the more IP

00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:07,809
that you give the less money you'll pay

00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:09,879
now the exception is the the community

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,769
level and we just added a thousand

00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:13,239
dollar fee because we are giving logos

00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:16,179
we're giving marketing we have somebody

00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:18,789
that works solely on the community level

00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:22,419
members and so but the benefits aren't

00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:24,669
it's great when you look at the startup

00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:26,679
it's for silver we have the two two ways

00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:28,659
to get the silver we have two ways to

00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,519
get the gold we have one level which is

00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:33,929
our highest here which is platinum and

00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:37,749
that rip that is the level that requires

00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:39,940
both an IP contribution and a time

00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:41,529
contribution at gold you can write us a

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,850
check and get the benefits for gold at

00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:45,190
silver you can write it I can get the

00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,840
benefits for silver at community and get

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,299
your ID check and get the benefits for

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,130
silver but to get that highest trademark

00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:53,810
you have to give a contribution and you

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,120
have to give time for the more merit

00:30:53,810 --> 00:31:00,710
that you have the less money that you

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,960
pay and so this one's kind of busy but

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,790
it just sort of highlights all the

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,110
different benefits that come along with

00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:12,140
the with membership and the reason that

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,940
again it's not to access the the

00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,500
technology or anything like that it's

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,870
when you want a quote from the

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:21,290
foundation or you want to be able to

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,570
submit something and give us the IP you

00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:25,670
have to be a certain level and you want

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,110
discounts on our summit like a connect

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,320
if you're a member and you want a

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,790
discount on sponsorship and that can be

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,100
pretty significant for example our

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,230
platinum sponsorship for our summit

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,540
that's coming up as 200 k but if you're

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:41,150
a platinum member you get your you get

00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,740
40k off of it and so you might have to

00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,420
pay for TK to become a platinum member

00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,380
but if you want to be a platinum sponsor

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,850
you get that 40 k right back so and then

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,620
you're eligible to become a solution

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,470
provider and and do all sorts of other

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,600
things with us but you can see the the

00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,810
more time and effort or the more time

00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,840
and IP that you give the less money that

00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:08,560
you pay any questions about its kind of

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:11,840
a unique model any questions about that

00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:16,390
get the mic yes no oh I thought you want

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:19,850
to so I got asked a question earlier oh

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:22,130
here's how we calculate the time and so

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,690
somebody always asks so I'm just going

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,000
to go ahead and address it somebody said

00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,820
why do you count email sent to a mailing

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,950
list well here's why and organizations

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,720
and we saw this oh I saw this when I was

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,760
here that there were a lot of companies

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,530
that didn't want to participate on the

00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,420
mailing list didn't want to do that open

00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,610
collaboration didn't like they were

00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,900
afraid of that collaboration may be

00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,670
afraid isn't the right word but

00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,140
apprehensive like what if I say

00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,550
something on this mailing list and my

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,740
boss season maybe I wasn't supposed to

00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,590
say it or what if i misspelled a word or

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,440
what if I any number of things that go

00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:57,800
through someone's head when they're

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,570
openly contributing right well we are an

00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,950
open organization and we are that

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,889
collaboration piece

00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:07,639
ki and so as part of their membership

00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:09,760
they have to participate openly and one

00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:11,870
of the ways we do that is to incentivize

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,179
participating on the mailing list and it

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,669
also teaches folks a little bit at a

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:18,889
time how to participate and how to get

00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:21,470
more involved in suit like one person

00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:23,029
from their organization will you know

00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,130
start answering emails and joining the

00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:26,419
conversation and then somebody else from

00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,850
their organization will start answering

00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:31,370
emails somebody else joins in so it's a

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,799
it's the first barrier of entry to get

00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,720
someone an organization who isn't

00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,460
familiar with how to participate in an

00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,470
open and collaborative manner to get

00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,860
them to do that and we give them we

00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,630
count that toward their time and then at

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,309
events they come to an engineering

00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,690
workshop some it's not too bad to get

00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:50,360
people to come to because a big industry

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,889
event you know there's there's sponsors

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,370
there's boost there's things like that

00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:57,350
everybody wants to be there but we

00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,940
incentivize those things too because we

00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,490
want those organizations to come out and

00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,990
join conversations like this well maybe

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,549
a little bit more lively than this and

00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,289
so but you know we want the conversation

00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:09,409
going and we want you know we want that

00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:11,240
to happen and so we do that in its eight

00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:14,149
hours per person per day of the event

00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,599
times of 1.5 travel multiplier so if it

00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:21,530
was connect if we had a five day event

00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:23,839
and it would be you know eight hours per

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,669
person from a company some companies

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:31,159
probably have what 10 people here so 80

00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:32,720
hours that way x 5 x 1.5 so you're

00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,300
looking the hours at it very quickly

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,679
because some people say 3120 hours

00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,599
that's a lot of hours well not when

00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,950
you're actively participating not when

00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,179
you're sending people to advance and

00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,409
you're joining the conversations on the

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,859
mailing list and you're doing that sort

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:47,690
of stuff it adds up very quickly when

00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:51,440
people don't participate that's when it

00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:52,970
doesn't happen it makes sense yep and

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,460
then we have our project leads we have

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,109
our white papers things like that our

00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,640
specifications and designs and then

00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:01,369
depend on which license you use there's

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:06,630
extra there's extra credit that's given

00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:09,240
as well so any questions there

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,980
anything that surprises anybody so far

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,080
like you were surprised at how we work

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,880
or or some people say the biggest

00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,910
surprise to most people is that we're

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,350
such a small organization but we're

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:23,940
doing so much and have such a big

00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:26,610
footprint what any other like anything

00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,850
that surprises you so far that I've

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:33,840
talked about I should have like seeded

00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:35,190
like people to ask questions or is it

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,510
just all making sense and everybody

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,200
wants to participate you want to figure

00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:41,760
out how you can get leg and LNG to like

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,870
partner with us and do some play that's

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,430
it is they're very motivated to do that

00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,510
but yeah so I think we have a pretty

00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,280
good model and I think we have a

00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,720
different model that's working for us

00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,060
and I think that's one of the reasons

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,360
that our networking group our networking

00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,180
group has a little over 2400 people

00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,770
signed up for it and has outpaced every

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,400
other group with the exception of our

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:14,040
server group and contributions so and

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:16,290
it's only three years old and then we

00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,970
have again the RP our guidelines

00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,250
probably boarding to you all but we

00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:23,070
don't allow folks to give quotes on well

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:24,870
we intend to give this contribution it

00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:27,450
has to be contributed and we have to

00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:30,330
recognize it before will let people talk

00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:34,710
about it or at least us give a quote

00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:40,760
about it get to all the support

00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:46,790
agreements curious about this part know

00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,790
anybody yes exactly did somebody say yes

00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:53,700
so in contributing to open compute we

00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,410
have four really different types of

00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,000
contributions or four different types of

00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,730
things that can be recognized as a

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,980
contribution we have our specification

00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,770
which is paper describes this hardware

00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,630
you know in detail we have the design

00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,970
files which or the production files

00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,920
which support that specification but

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,200
they also support the product the

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,810
product can't be contributed in license

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,790
but it can be

00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:19,070
we can recognize that it meets the

00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:22,880
criteria and follow the specifics back

00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:24,800
in design and we can brand to allow

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,540
people to brand it use the trademark of

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:33,020
ocp accepted and inspired the trademark

00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:35,150
alone goes with the ocp inspired

00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:38,270
trademark in the ocp accepted trademark

00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,610
follows the product and as you can see

00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,770
here all whether it's inspired or

00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,660
whether it's accepted it bows it has to

00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:46,250
be based on an accepted specification

00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,820
somebody has had to contribute a

00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,380
specification for people to follow the

00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,990
main difference between inspired and

00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,060
accepted is that except it requires

00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:58,790
someone to sign over the IP to us

00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:01,240
inspired as basically a glorified

00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:04,760
product sheet that we get the reformat

00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,350
we have to have there's a checklist and

00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,880
extensive checklists that we kind of go

00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,890
through make sure it's all being met and

00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,020
then it has to have support agreements

00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,820
in place because well we found early on

00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,970
and maybe maybe this is where you all

00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:19,430
could educate me in that that you've

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:24,230
seen especially on like the arm side of

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:25,850
hardware when an organization opens up

00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:29,540
their specification on our side early on

00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:32,600
they supported first users so if we had

00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:34,700
maybe Facebook it gave a specification

00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,980
and then whoever their odm was would

00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,800
make the hardware and make those designs

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,170
available but somebody else adopted that

00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,610
same sku from them there wouldn't be a

00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,800
support agreement in place from that

00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:49,570
other person you know it would only be

00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,570
first user the person the person who

00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,260
opened it up or gave the specification

00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,510
and so that made it very hard for

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,770
adoption maybe like if one of you were

00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,390
to go out and buy that same piece of

00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,980
hardware and have trouble installing

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,540
something on it or wouldn't work and you

00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,790
go back to who you got it from and they

00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,260
said well it's based on the spec there's

00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,790
the spec you go figure it out there

00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,590
wasn't support so now we're requiring

00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,420
support in order to brand it as open

00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:15,740
compute a support agreement must be in

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:17,960
place and so those are the main two

00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,640
differences any questions about this

00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,630
piece of it or are you finding an

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,060
interesting or boring I know it's after

00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,810
lunch but

00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:32,110
so I'm curious about how the

00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:36,310
specification goes and how did the

00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:39,820
supporting design bits are made so you

00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:41,950
specify this is a module it's got to be

00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,530
this size and have these power

00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,980
connectors and whatever but are you also

00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:51,570
specifying the board layout for the PCB

00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:54,070
so how's that work no so a good example

00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:56,560
now go and I want to relate it to arm

00:39:54,070 --> 00:40:01,060
specifically so how are you all familiar

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,120
with cavium Thunder export okay so in

00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,400
that cavion created the board the

00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,690
chipsets arm they didn't open up that

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,310
chipset but they said here's the

00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,500
reference for the board they created

00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:15,100
just great so then penguin could take

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,780
that same board and saying okay we're

00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,450
going to make it fit in this chassis

00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,610
which bolts into our bus barn powered by

00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,860
the bus bar on the v2 back right so you

00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:25,450
just not having some concepts we want to

00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,100
know the reference architecture piece of

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,450
it I don't care what chipsets in it I

00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,540
want other people to be able to innovate

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:34,240
and drive that particular technology and

00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,430
be able to create you know an arm server

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:41,440
that fits into one of our racks right

00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:43,150
and so that the specification we are

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,580
specifications especially on the server

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,890
side are probably 80 to 90 pages long

00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:51,190
and it's a very detailed description of

00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:53,410
that of them board if you will for that

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,960
the rack we have a rack standard that

00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,910
governs the v1 rack and the v2 rack that

00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,610
all specifications have to meet in order

00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:02,530
to be called open rack and so it gets

00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,450
you can go to the website you can go to

00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,070
open compute org slash wiki and go to

00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,600
any of our projects and see any of those

00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,400
specifications that are there and you

00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,710
can dive as deep into it as you want the

00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,960
idea being that if you take the

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:16,360
specification and then you take the

00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,010
design files someone should be able to

00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,050
take both of those and go bin metal if

00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,480
they want or innovate on top of it or

00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,010
create a new solution or you know make

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,300
the next whoop-dee-doo ladder you know

00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,890
out of it or whatever you want to call

00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,170
it but you know what I mean like there

00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,030
should be able to go and innovate based

00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,100
on what is in the specifications and

00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,290
design files so is there anything in the

00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,810
specification that relates to the

00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,500
software that you can run on that excuse

00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,290
Oh weather

00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,690
of the hardware that half of the street

00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,880
not in the specification now because

00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:47,800
here's the thing so when you're dealing

00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,300
with with a lot of boards especially

00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,430
like with bios and firmware and think

00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,370
you know things like that right or BMC's

00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:56,290
for example like if you don't own it you

00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:58,210
can't give it you can't open it up but

00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:01,720
if somebody's given a contribution that

00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,580
requires specific software firmware if

00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,420
you were able to run on it or specific

00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:08,860
bios or specific BMC that you know runs

00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:12,340
on it they have to at least give a link

00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:15,940
to what it is so because you can't open

00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,350
up what you don't own you know so the

00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,910
thing I'm thinking specifically of his

00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,470
things like whether or not those

00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,180
mainline support in the kernel for the

00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,680
heart whether some the poor now and

00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,300
again we don't get into that piece of it

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,100
and let me show you the excellent that

00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:34,300
the other layer that we've added now

00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:36,730
that we're rolling out so if you'll look

00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:39,250
here we have have the folks that give

00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,740
the hardware right whether it's accepted

00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,360
or inspired then we have folks who put

00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,430
it all together right they make a test

00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,470
configuration based on open compute gear

00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,660
and we're going to document that and

00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:51,730
then we have your software vendors who

00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,830
would come in and verify their software

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:55,660
works on this particular sku and then

00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,520
they would give us that instruction set

00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,020
they would get credit for giving us

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,180
instructions that we would create a

00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,100
library and then we would help promote

00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,520
that in the searchable database you

00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,650
could say i want this particular sku and

00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,660
I want to see okay what what software

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,910
runs on these servers right or what

00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,650
software runs on these networks which is

00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:16,090
or what you know and then we'll build

00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,000
that up but we're just now starting to

00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:22,480
build get into the software layer make

00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,870
sense yeah yeah and I think I mean look

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,010
how we're doing on time here okay so i

00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:29,890
got like three minutes and i have to

00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,680
shut up but what I would like to see and

00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:35,890
I would if anybody has ideas around it

00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,810
we really like to figure out you know

00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,060
base I mean we have a pretty open model

00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,010
and allow for those partnerships and

00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,770
things like that I'd really like to see

00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:49,069
how we can get some contributions but

00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:51,569
you know from arm-based anything

00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:53,369
into the data center space because

00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:55,079
people think arm servers but that's not

00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:57,390
the only thing that's using a data

00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,940
center around arm you have the

00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:03,390
monitoring piece some a lot of folks use

00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:06,210
arm learn boards to do the monitoring

00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,700
and or the management piece with inside

00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,560
the data center things like that and so

00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,849
if there's contributions and nearer

00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,220
around the data center that you can

00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:21,240
think of let's figure out how we can

00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:22,530
help let's figure out how we can sort of

00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,240
form those partnerships or if your

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,089
organization is interested in getting

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,520
more involved in any of those nine

00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:31,200
top-level projects and and helping drive

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,359
that whether it's on the hardware side

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,220
whether it's on the software side you

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,190
know but keep in mind if your software

00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,990
and you don't run on an x86 or an open

00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,460
power platform because we have both I

00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,460
don't know if any of you guys saw the

00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:46,950
barreleye with IBM Rackspace and open

00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,530
power just went GA availability last

00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,690
week or week before last we own that IP

00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,819
they've contributed to us so now we have

00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,490
the x86 architecture as part of our

00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:58,140
interview we have the open Power

00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,450
Architecture that's part of open compute

00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,280
I'd really like to see something for the

00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,319
data center that's arm-based so we would

00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,150
have all three architectures as part of

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,180
the open compute ecosystem and help

00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,890
drive that as well so if you can think

00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,710
of those ways that we can do that and

00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:15,450
work together to do that i would love to

00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:18,480
brainstorm with you and bring that back

00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:21,270
and wrap up you know wrap in my CTO and

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,430
and let's see what we can let's see what

00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,780
we can accomplish but I hope I didn't

00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,630
put everybody to sleep and I hope that

00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,280
your hope that it was just like drinking

00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,690
from the firehose and you're just trying

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,000
to figure out like what do I do with all

00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,560
this information but if you have

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,420
questions or you want to talk about it

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,250
later please find me because I think

00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,470
it's great i think the efforts that you

00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:42,150
all are doing here is great this whole

00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,680
open hardware business and driving the

00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,750
innovation across all these multiple

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,700
architectures i want to drive it in the

00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,800
data center space but if i could help

00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:53,089
you know make contacts and do other

00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,089
stuff let me know yes

00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:02,880
not yet I was introduced to them today

00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:04,710
to do some other stuff so yeah well some

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,470
of it yes yes some of what they're doing

00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,840
yeah well some of what they do now but

00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:12,060
if you come in with what it is you want

00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:16,380
their about making a reference platform

00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:21,120
right and so if you want arm boards in

00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:23,550
that in this space then you should work

00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,980
with them on a specification which they

00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:28,590
can we wouldn't create the spec it would

00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:31,350
be somebody here that says I want this

00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:33,660
and then whoever creates it with the 96

00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:36,480
boards project we want to contribute it

00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,790
to open compute is manufacture and sell

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,860
anything we just we would work with my

00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:43,560
partner and make available you're ninety

00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,990
six boards folks to our community and so

00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:49,350
that's how I see you know that that were

00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:51,630
I caught that what I'm saying is what

00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:54,900
the ninety six boards team does is they

00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:57,450
make reference boards that manufacturers

00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:02,490
out there can duplicate they put they do

00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:06,180
put the spec together but you would have

00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:08,430
to facilitate that process in order to

00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,600
interest them yeah yeah we have a median

00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,240
on either later today or tomorrow

00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,220
sometime yeah yeah good enough yeah

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,900
we're gonna see wow it works out so I

00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,490
was quite interested in that and see how

00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,260
it goes but I also want to see some of

00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,580
the folks that are involved in the

00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,610
enterprise group and the networking

00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,430
group to help drive that as well because

00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:28,170
I just think there's some opportunities

00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,790
that are there so I don't want to

00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,560
commute from your next session but thank

00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:36,050
you so much for coming and let me know

00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,050
if you have any other questions thank

00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,540
