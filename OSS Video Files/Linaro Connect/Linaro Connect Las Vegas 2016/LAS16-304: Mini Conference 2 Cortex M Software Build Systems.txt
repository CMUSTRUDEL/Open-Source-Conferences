★ Session Description ★
In composing RTOS-based images to run on embedded systems, there are number of different issues that come into play that are different from building a root fs for Linux. Issues such as how third-party libraries and code link with the OS, how we pull down the code, etc. Additionally, such systems may also need to support the creation of filesystem-based images. There are several options that exist today (“newt" - a tool from the Apache Mynewt project in the Apache Software Foundation; “yotta" - from ARM mbed; the Yocto Project; and more). This session will discuss required features, compare and contrast project approaches, and potential additions and changes that are needed in this space.
