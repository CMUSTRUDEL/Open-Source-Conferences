★ Session Description ★
Title: TianoCore – Open Source UEFI Community Update

The TianoCore project hosts EDK II, an open source implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). EDK II has become the defacto UEFI implementation for ARM and Intel platforms, expanding standards based firmware across multiple architectures. This keynote will provide an update on the current status of the TianoCore project, plans for future improvements, and a discussion of why firmware is critical in today’s digital ecosystem.

Bio
Brian Richardson is an Intel technical evangelist who has spent most of his career as a “BIOS guy” working on the firmware that quietly boots billions of computers. Brian has focused on the industry transition to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), demystifying how firmware works and simplifying firmware development tools. Brian has presented at LinuxCon, UEFI Plugfests, and Intel Developer Forum. He is a blogger for the Intel Software Evangelists project, former writer forlinux.com, and (apropos of nothing) executive producer for DragonConTV.

	00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,210
good morning I'm sorry I made you wake

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,950
up this early to applaud an Intel guy I

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,050
know that's a little unusual but bear

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,910
with me because that's actually not what

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,089
I'm here to talk about I have been with

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,550
Intel for some time doing engagement on

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,900
UEFI but I'm here to talk about more of

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,699
the work that I'm doing with the open

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,380
source side I've recently moved into the

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,990
position of community evangelist for

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,769
Tiano core which is our open source

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,269
implementation for UEFI so I want to

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,830
talk more about that and less about what

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,530
I actually do for a living with the

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,660
little chips with the guys and the suits

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,760
because I'm a software guy what I do

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,629
want to talk about is first just an

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,180
introduction a little bit of a

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,910
background on why we're doing

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,960
standardized firmware why that might be

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,850
a good thing

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,320
second I want to focus more on the

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,440
recent changes that we've made the

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,410
tiyanak or governance stewardship code

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,940
check-ins changes in source control

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,100
plans for the future if there's a

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,210
community evangelist we must be talking

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,620
to people about stuff we want to do

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,129
turns out we have things we want to do

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,750
and finally a lot of folks don't kind of

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,490
understand some of the history that I've

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,049
come from with firmware in the PC

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,640
industry so I want to kind of talk about

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,920
why I think from where is important and

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,180
why as a marketing person I spend all my

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,430
days working on something that's for

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,200
works perfectly nobody ever sees this

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,909
may have been a bad career choice but it

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,740
got me to a keynote so I think I'm doing

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:27,540
ok first let's go with the introduction

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,159
Tianna core is the name of the project

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,590
we use for supporting the EFI

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,960
development kit UK now in its second

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:41,460
generation it is from about 2004 oh look

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,780
the streaming works that's good so we're

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,310
supporting a BSD open-source

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,710
implementation of UEFI and our mission

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,670
is to improve our contributions to the

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,700
community improve the code quality we're

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,810
trying to go for a product quality tree

00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,540
we're also trying to provide regular

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,390
updates the whole point of open source

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,680
is to show your work even before it's

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,869
finished which is a little embarrassing

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,610
for some people but we are trying to

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,190
work on that and provide more end-to-end

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,870
solutions firmware is designed to bring

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,650
up a platform if you don't have

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,620
platforms

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,670
how do you prove the firmware works so

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,170
we're actually trying to make sure that

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,060
people can go and get commercially

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,250
available solutions pull down firmware

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,900
build their own variations of that and

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,610
prove out whatever concepts they need in

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,000
their firmware variations my vision

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,709
personally is more activity in EB k2

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,599
this is something that I was actually

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,579
kind of critical of in our own people

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,079
for a certain amount of time that we

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:42,569
didn't have enough outside contribution

00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:44,939
for a long period of time this was very

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,889
much where Intel worked on Intel things

00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,190
and putting Intel code into open-source

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:51,750
I used to write for Linux comm I kind of

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,950
have an idea what we should be doing an

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,269
open source I'm trying to make sure we

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,310
push towards something that's more

00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:58,139
transparent and it's more community

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,639
driven and actually has a wider variety

00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:06,569
of solutions okay

00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:09,780
BIOS blame it on software know basic

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,389
input/output system the good about this

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,700
this was the original bottom layer that

00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,370
the IBM PC put out so bunch of guys in

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,000
Boca Raton Florida early 80s decided

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,879
they were gonna build a personal

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,470
computer might I got laughed out a

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,660
little bit but they sold a few units

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,609
they were supposed to have sell 250,000

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,739
for the run they might have done a

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,359
little bit better than that they

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,359
accidentally kind of created an offshoot

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:35,430
of the industry that a bottom layer

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:36,930
their basic input/output system was what

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,970
abstracted the operating system from the

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,190
hardware now that sounds like a basic

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,940
concept but if you were doing computing

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,669
in the late 70s early 80s you didn't

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,290
have that you had machine specific boot

00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,549
code boot straps written to machine

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,190
specific operating systems

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,810
this was the mainframe model that IBM

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,639
made a lot of money off of and ended up

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,430
through the personal computing model

00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,870
trying to break a little bit one of the

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,099
nice things about it was that you could

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,620
change the operating system without

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,849
changing the underlying boot layer you

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,989
can change the boot layer and still be

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,840
compatible with the existing operating

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:12,000
system so this is why the gentleman in

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,280
the front row is able to write his own

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,569
OS and sort of start another kind of

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,389
resolution but I'm not here to talk

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:21,359
about that he does a much better job if

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,860
you added an expansion card turns out it

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,810
carried it to an initialization driver

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,159
the bottom layer firmware didn't need to

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,490
know about that it just needed to know

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:30,759
how to talk to that OP

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,669
wrong so if you added back in the day a

00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,830
second floppy drive ooh

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,630
that may carry its container tell how to

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,580
initialize it you added the whopping 10

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,870
megabyte hard drive you added the

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,410
controller that may have had its own

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,509
init code for that it was ubiquitous so

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,310
when Compaq decided to black box

00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:49,840
engineer it or read the magic purple

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,430
book which had all the assembly

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
instructions and jump tables printed in

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,910
it they were able to replicate it to a

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,310
point that they could run the same

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,569
operating systems they did then somebody

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,580
else replicated that somebody else

00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:02,949
replicated that a guy from India moved

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,349
to the u.s. started a company called ami

00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:09,840
gave me a job for 15 years I am onshore

00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:12,190
in sourcing it works so that was nice

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,620
what was kind of terrible about it

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,380
we kept using it for better part of

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:23,220
three decades and it was a 16-bit

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,220
assembly model because on the 8086 8086

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,490
panshin roms it was supposed to be

00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,409
extensible except for the points where

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:39,250
it never left that 16-bit operating

00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:44,349
model so your modern you know Intel Core

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:46,180
i7 59 30k processor I know that because

00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:48,759
I owned one I didn't memorize our entire

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,860
chart I'm a software guy that starts out

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,479
in 16-bit mode in real mode and then it

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,909
eventually has to jump into a protected

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,919
mode I've heard it called owning a

00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,409
Porsche that starts out as a Yugo until

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,270
it hits the end of the driveway not the

00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:03,069
best model in the world so it's hard to

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,990
expand on that where you have to factor

00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,330
in compatibility for something that has

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,270
almost an order of magnitude fewer bits

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:13,090
in its native operating mode it wasn't

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,889
standardized yes there's a document you

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,659
can find on the internet written in HTML

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,909
one point something that has all of the

00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:20,530
different extension codes compiled but

00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:23,110
that wasn't standardized and agreed on

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,490
that sort of harvested knowledge you've

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,710
had to know a guy who knew a guy who

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,659
know really old guy who wrote all this

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,630
stuff and had it either memorized or

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:35,560
written down somewhere and it did not

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:37,240
have a concept of openness the thing we

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,710
try to do through UEFI unified

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,110
extensible firmware interface is to fix

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,720
these three things one we don't lock

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,940
model to particular architecture to

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,180
there's an extensibility concept through

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:52,180
protocols and standardization and then

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,210
the open part is not part of UEFI UEFI

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,010
focuses on the standard Tianna core is

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,960
one implementation of that it's not

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,460
endorsed by the UEFI form even though a

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,500
lot of the same people who work on the

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,090
form and contributed to the early days

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,040
of the spec are also contributing to

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,150
this they are considered two separate

00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,790
things if somebody comes out with

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:15,670
another open form of UEFI woohoo great

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,050
ok I have heard this so many times we

00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,750
already had something that worked Brian

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,580
why don't we just patch it I mentioned I

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,190
worked at a BIOS company for 15 years

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,180
the first 5 of mine looked a little like

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,770
this I have I hope that most of the code

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,230
I wrote in those days is gone out of

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,250
circulation

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,990
you know it's assembly code I'm

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,240
basically like grunting at the machines

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,290
or yelling 0 & 1 at Siri and hoping it

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,600
gets them in the right order when it

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,880
compiles this this is probably not a

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,260
good way to build an industry this might

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,850
work for a one-off product but when you

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,560
try to expand or if you build something

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,390
and say I built it for this version of

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,890
Linux kernel and somebody comes along

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,200
and says that's great I want to buy your

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,250
board and run FreeBSD on it and you

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,690
haven't worked that out in your loader

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,350
that's a competitive issue ok

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,340
standardization is supremely important

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,160
there are a lot of times where ad hoc

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,450
things turn into standards or people

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,890
start from standards in the beginning

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,560
what is good is that you come up with a

00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,360
process you document it and you have the

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,840
ability to add people to it and add

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,970
their ideas to it this picture I took in

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,460
Germany about six years ago you have

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,460
those random animals you drop into a

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,400
city Atlanta had cows for some reason

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,720
there are dolphins and artists would

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,320
paint them up and mock them up and this

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,990
is kind of my reminder to our engineers

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,390
what happens when you don't like spec

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,940
out a project before you start it turns

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,950
out kind of looking like whatever this

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:46,360
animal is supposed to be so this is my

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:49,060
standards Petronas okay specifications

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,950
I'm not gonna read these to you you the

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,320
coffee hasn't kicked in yet they're

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,730
really big they scare people because

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,200
they're really big we wrote everything

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,670
we don't have to remember which is f to

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,580
remember where to find it which is UEFA

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:04,590
org so there's the UEFI specification

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,030
currently in 2.6 standard revision and

00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,140
that is the layer between the operating

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,600
system and the firmware it doesn't

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,490
dictate how the firmware is built so

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,260
this interface could be on a commercial

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,780
bias could be on open source it could be

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,630
a core boot or new boot payload then

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,980
there's a CPI underneath that and then

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,690
the packaging

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,880
sorry platform initialization which is

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,410
how the modules underneath communicate

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,770
if you're gonna build UEFI all the way

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,750
down then P I dictate how silicon

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,960
modules talk to silicon modules or how

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,950
silicon modules talk to dispatchers

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,630
packaging is how you put those things

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,970
together in a way that someone else can

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,000
consume it if you're going to distribute

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,370
binaries that somebody wraps UEFI around

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,500
either in a closed or open source way P

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,780
idak takes that and then there is a

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,290
shell the shell is just kind of a

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:55,290
rudimentary dose like BSD like thing

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,930
that just allows you to run utilities

00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,880
it's really meant as a pre-production

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,550
environment some people do ship the

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,400
shell with their platforms but that's

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,900
less and less of a thing these days it's

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,490
really more of an environment if I want

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:15,720
to run tests if I want to automate my

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:19,240
production systems okay recent changes

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,100
first of all II dk2

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,080
and tiyanak or started out as an Intel

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,650
initiative in the early days of moving

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,290
EFI from an internal Intel document to

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,320
an industry standard we decided to open

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:34,630
source a large portion of the code if

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,010
you've gone to one of my far too

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,000
numerous sessions at ID after you've

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,410
gone to another UEFI specification

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,720
presentation you seen this thing called

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,130
the big green H this is the first time

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,510
I've given a UEFI presentation a long

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,040
time it doesn't have the big green H in

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,450
it I know a lot of you tired of it but

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,940
it's this idea that you have this

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,100
framework and that the framework is open

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,900
and that components at the top end or

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,260
the bottom end sort of fit into the

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,210
space and the H moving into more of a

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,920
standards environment we recently

00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,570
decided that tiana cord needed to follow

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,240
a more open governance model it

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,410
shouldn't be a thing that intel is fully

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,330
policing and controlling

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,630
that's not open that's just releasing

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,040
your code after you're done so leaf and

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,990
who's hitting the front row here from

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,120
one ro Michael Kinney was a principal

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:22,540
engineer at Intel and Andrew fish who is

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,660
one of the UEFI and EFI architects who

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,820
moved over to Apple many years ago are

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,110
essentially the community maintainer x'

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,610
so they're handing all the technical

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,140
stuff I stand on stage in front of

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,580
pretty lights and pointed PowerPoint and

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:39,700
encouraged people to use the things that

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:42,130
they're working on we moved to get thank

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,770
goodness I love yet this helps with a

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,080
lot of things one it got us off of a

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,570
platform that shall not be named unless

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,950
I'm at a bar that was having some issues

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,490
and wasn't probably the best thing for

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,630
us to be using second get helps us with

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,490
a lot of things I'm going to talk about

00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,170
in a few minutes as far as doing staging

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,450
branches and taking private

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,460
contributions in code before their IP

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,130
clean and merge them into the main

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,440
branch it also happens to be some of my

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:13,480
friends work so yay they get to keep

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:17,830
their jobs our staging branch workflow

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,900
which I alluded to mere seconds ago we

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,130
want to keep the main branch focused on

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,660
becoming a product quality

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,750
implementation about that is where the

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,280
stable things live so but we still want

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,560
to work in the open so staging branches

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,800
are a great way to work on this

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,350
let's take boot through HTTP through TLS

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,690
yay secure boot that doesn't happen to

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,390
happen on like a PXE system so I can do

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,460
it outside of my network I have gold

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,840
status on two airlines recovering my

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,760
notebook outside of a corporate

00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,380
environment is extremely important to me

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,740
I would like that to be able to happen

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,170
in case it ever comes up so I want this

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,460
to work we're not gonna put that into

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,200
the main branch until we're sure it

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,840
works we have a pretty good solution

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,430
right now you can run Susi on it fairly

00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,680
well they have stuff in their open

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,570
branch that's compatible with it we went

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,730
to a plugfest we found problems glad I

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,320
didn't ship with those once that's done

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,240
and goes through its normal contribution

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,880
and review practice that's gonna get

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,410
merged into the main tree so that allows

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,550
again our main tree to be focused on

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,500
what people are doing

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,540
they'd rely on it as a product they're

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,040
gonna want to pull from the non staging

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,040
branches for their product quality code

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:34,250
okay file allocation table the fat Oh

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,300
Lennox people love fat yay so let me

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,470
give a little background about why this

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,330
is super important

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,060
one thing that UEFI specifies is a

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,370
transition of disk structure Master Boot

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,440
Record MBR was the structure that was

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,960
used from the early piece a days all the

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,010
way up it is what legacy BIOS boots - it

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,290
is a magic sector of your drive that has

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,530
magic bits on it that tell you literally

00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,640
this is a place that you jump - I was

00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,380
written by assembly programmers in

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,660
Florida 30-plus years ago so their idea

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,960
was you just tell this to jump to a

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,530
place in memory and you'll boot the OS

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,960
and trust me

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,340
if I walk off the stage and I don't know

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,110
where the stage ends I'm not just gonna

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,030
like wander off and go I'm just gonna go

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,570
to the casino right I need to know where

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:19,040
that barrier is so just blindly jumping

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,720
into code is why we had boot sector

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,240
viruses yeah and lots of other problems

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,180
the MBR wasn't redundant if that first

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,360
block of the disk got cut off if you

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,370
typed format C colon slash s hit Enter

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,720
went oops and hit ctrl C your disk is

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,130
already gone unless you have a good

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,470
recovery tool because that gets blown

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:39,740
away there's no backup copy so we moved

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,480
to GPT bigger disks 9.8 set of bytes

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,610
which I can't even fathom as a storage

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,710
but it also changed the boot structure

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,900
for UEFI instead of having a magic

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,240
sector you have a defined service

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,560
partition and at the time we wanted to

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,780
use kind of the simplest dumbest thing

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,550
that was available which was fat the

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,600
licensing restrictions sort of starting

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:02,720
to kick in and when people do emulators

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,670
now the emulator is shipping on a system

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,520
there is a fat license that was already

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,750
an agreement for UEFI it said oh if

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,550
you're using it for a boot sector no

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,320
problem you can ship fat with no issue

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,270
just don't use it to format anything

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,280
else once you put it in that container

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,900
on the simulator you were outside of

00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,570
that license so the simulator is all

00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,990
used see bios yay not what I'm working

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,260
on

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,150
so changing this is a very big deal not

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,120
only for Linux but things like ovm F

00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,820
which we rely on within UEFI to do a lot

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,650
of simulation before we ship so as of

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,260
this March Microsoft removed the use

00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,600
Clause from UEFI fat sources

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,030
for anyone who's not a lawyer that means

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,310
that there's no restriction of use and

00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:47,810
it's just two claws bsd which means in

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,850
even less terms you can take it and work

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,810
on it you know what to give it back

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,810
sorry about that that wasn't my choice

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,480
okay LLVM and clang some people call it

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,120
sealing I think clanging sounds cooler

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,130
clang it's a good word we've been

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,800
supporting GCC for a while mostly in the

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,720
four-point axe branches we haven't been

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,640
shipping it a lot because we didn't

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,350
really have it optimized very well and

00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,090
the binary sizes were kind of

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,540
embarrassingly large like they wouldn't

00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,460
fit into the flash part so a lot of our

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,350
loyal Islands reliance and validation

00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,330
has been done on Visual Studio just

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,150
don't boo people are listening on the

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,580
internet should boo inside it's cool a

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:33,380
couple of reasons why we went to LLVM

00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,550
and GCC 5.3 one yeh community - I don't

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,590
like relying on a single tree of

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,140
compilers I used to do a lot of testing

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:42,410
work validation nuts so I like making

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,440
sure I have options also these two tools

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,360
have link time optimization which gets

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,000
your binary sizes you know within reason

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,570
and also allows you to do a lot of cool

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,740
static analysis the clang analyzer is

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,880
something we're gonna be working with a

00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,280
lot more in the future

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,530
static analysis allows you to find

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,810
stupid programming mistakes you can do

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:06,020
security scans on code before you ship

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,490
it to millions of people good thing I'm

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,990
in this conference in Vegas and not a

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,449
different conference in Vegas watching

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,770
someone talk about my work and we did a

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,459
lot of this on Linux because that's

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,110
where these compiler tools work best my

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,300
hope going forward is that something

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,949
like LLVM becomes the standard compiler

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,329
across different operating systems

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,230
that's another advantage it really gives

00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,910
us GCC works really best a Linux

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,710
environment which means if you don't

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,140
have a good way to replicate that you

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,940
know chain on Windows then you can't do

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,620
cross validation but if I have a single

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,390
compiler that goes across different

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,040
operating systems then I have a much

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,570
stronger way of saying yeah I'm sure

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,770
then when I build this over here it's

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,910
also going to build over there and

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,910
everyone has a consistent experience

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,080
all right sizes we did a lot of

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,120
experiments on this there's two

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,910
particular results I want to point out

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,870
one is for ovm F which is the emulator

00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,760
we use generically and these are

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,860
compared to Visual Studio 2015

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,760
both of these cases have linked on

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:09,830
optimization enabled Clank actually was

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,330
doing better than Visual Studio was

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,040
which has been visual students been our

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:17,390
main compiler tree since the beginning

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,600
of etk - when it says 0% it just means

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,049
it's even it is the same size within the

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,520
you know sampling error

00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:27,559
Galileo which is an i-32 full

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,900
open-source project we picked this one

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,960
because there's no magic binaries

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,580
lurking underneath the hood this gives

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,070
us pretty comparable sizes there's still

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,010
improvements to be made but the I didn't

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,870
put the GCC 4 numbers up because sorry

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,520
they weren't that great some of them

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,160
were really high percentage differences

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,080
and for early days on this this gives us

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,419
a good platform to work from to increase

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,740
our optimization of ROM sizes because

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:53,740
flash-based costs money

00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:01,040
ok bugs I like my friends that get we

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,830
weren't that fond of their bug tracking

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,360
system but we have been using Bugzilla

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,950
and different groups off and on and it's

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,370
become a pretty common platform across

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,169
open-source for bug reporting so we now

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,299
have Bugzilla tiyanak or org

00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:16,160
we recently got all security

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:17,540
certificates installed on this so don't

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,650
worry when you clink the leak if you

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,309
click the link on the materials it goes

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,840
to the HTTPS version and that was

00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:26,510
sitting on a temporary domain but we

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,549
have that resolved now this is where we

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,470
put everything we put core issues

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,330
platform issues and feature requests

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,370
this is another part of our you know

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,000
community efforts and our work towards

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:40,610
like a more transparent process security

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,790
issues you're gonna find them

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,990
everybody's code of security issues

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:48,080
we're gonna use a different process for

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,549
this and that is documented but I'm

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,580
gonna sum up the three steps of

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:54,290
reporting security bug to Tiano core one

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,570
is you never use email to report

00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,850
security issue second is you put them in

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,860
a category called Tiano security issues

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,420
this is essentially an embargoed

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,429
space that you can only see if you're in

00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,650
the US RT and UEFI that's the security

00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:08,270
response team or you are one of the

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,429
people working on security issues or the

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,830
reporter that is so people don't

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,929
publicly go find a security issue you

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,460
haven't disclosed this isn't can become

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:17,960
a database of zero days this is

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,640
something we use to resolve things and

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,360
properly work through issues before they

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:27,170
become known three you never use email

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,370
to discuss a security issue this is

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,679
because if you've been paying attention

00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,420
to American politics emails are a thing

00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,450
and sometimes they don't go to the

00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,309
places you think they're going to go for

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,230
point-to-point communications if you

00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:41,030
sign your email that's great we use

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,220
community email lists it's a little

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,090
harder you can sign for you know

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,350
authenticate authentication hi I'm Brian

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,540
but it's harder to keep that in the

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,370
contained group and I don't want things

00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,049
that people are reporting against the

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,450
core root of trust on your platform to

00:20:54,049 --> 00:21:01,150
get out before they are known to them

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:05,630
you know we have a known solution okay

00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:07,610
plans we have them I'm not going to go

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,440
into huge detail on many of these or a

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,960
few I want to emphasize first is the

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,270
website along with being a validation

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,780
not I'm a documentation nut we could use

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:19,160
more of that we moved our system website

00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,250
system over to get and we're gonna start

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,830
using get books a lot more the idea that

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,990
you make a document in like OpenOffice

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,870
or word a frame maker and you PDF it and

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,970
put it out into the world as a spec I

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,470
don't print that much anymore so paper

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,990
formatting is not a big deal for me I

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,790
would like to have something simple that

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,000
you can read on different devices or

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:43,340
have an easier time contributing to open

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,549
test cases way to you if I plug fest

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,470
last week in Seattle and had a fairly

00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:51,860
long conversation about opening up a lot

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,360
of the test process Mike Kinney who are

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,630
to me at Intel really wants to start

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,950
moving open test cases into etk to so

00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,990
you have more of the test apparatus

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:03,919
along with the thing you're using for

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:06,770
the firmware open platforms which is

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,390
Leafs big thing arm has actually been

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,570
our biggest driver of opening up

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,429
platforms so right now you have more

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,450
open arm platforms than you have as

00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:16,310
Intel

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,900
I notice I'm not frowning when I say

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:21,410
that and you would think I would be

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,940
there are things that you can find on an

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,520
arm platform that wouldn't be revealed

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,140
on an Intel and vice versa so if I do

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,390
all my full testing on just Intel

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,630
platforms I'm not gonna find every

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,460
possible issue I can get in a protocol

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,870
so from an open source standpoint at

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,040
Intel if they put a bunch of armed

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,690
platforms out and work out all these

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,550
weird issues that I can't replicate on

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,020
current hardware that's better for me

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,480
that's kind of an open source thing

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,130
that's why I'm in favor of this

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,750
now of course I'm inside my own company

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,610
saying words I won't say on stage in

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,830
Vegas I might say them at the blackjack

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,770
table 11:00 in the evening but I won't

00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,500
say them here about why don't we do more

00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,450
open platforms and we are so there are

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,370
more examples of the Intel side going

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,190
into open source over the coming months

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,600
and the next one I'm going to focus on a

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,160
little bit more which is releases on a

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:14,350
regular cadence we do snapshot releases

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,970
typically every six to eight quarters

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,010
stable snapshot is basically we tested

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,810
this on a whole bunch of things we like

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,340
it it's good we know when you start

00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,810
working on firmware kind of like you

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,540
start working on something based on a

00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:28,100
kernel you don't go off of that kernel

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,570
and make significant changes once you

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,980
start your core platform development

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,350
unless there's a really compelling

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,210
reason so people lock in firmware cores

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,870
pretty early in the design process to

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,430
unstable Hardware and unstable firmware

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,260
that's a bad combination you typically

00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,990
want stable Hardware unstable firmware

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:48,350
or stable firmware and hopefully soon to

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,690
be unstable hardware but that release

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,900
timing that's long it's a long time to

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:56,120
wait we want to get to more of a two per

00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,730
year release maybe four if things are

00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,530
not going well but from what I'm talking

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,930
to people here at the conference to

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,780
stable snapshots a year seems to be a

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,180
good time and this will kind of be a

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,240
cascading thing platforms will be where

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,760
you reveal your issues where you try out

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,100
your staging branches so things will

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,370
flow from platform to staging to main

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,080
branch to stable the naming convention

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,730
which I might change because it's a

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,190
little confusing when things go to

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,620
stable branch we call them UDK or UEFI

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,039
development kit releases

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:32,110
based on the EFI development kit

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,419
second-generation so we might rename

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,919
that but anytime you see UDK in front of

00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:38,650
something it's gonna be a stable

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,080
snapshot it goes to a particular get

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,760
hash or it goes to a you know heaven

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,970
forbid a zip file full of things that

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,679
are based on that stable platform so we

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,750
want to get into more of a continuous

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,520
requirements fix this validation release

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,520
cycle to make sure we're keeping pace

00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,529
all right we're talking about releases

00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:01,270
we have one coming up it's gonna be

00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:02,830
early next year I'm when I say q1 I

00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:07,570
don't mean marketing q1 which is March

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:09,039
like 30th I mean like January this is

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,080
going to include a number of features

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,210
again the caffeine hasn't kicked in yet

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,730
so I'm not gonna put them all down on

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,399
the sheet we wrote it down in a spec so

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,140
you don't have to memorize this but

00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:23,500
we're doing a more generic stack for

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,960
emmc and SD cards that's based on UEFI

00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,470
2.6 work there's a new memory attributes

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,220
table

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:33,490
there's HTTP boot along with TLS that's

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,320
over ipv6 a ram disk which is important

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,270
for the previous feature because when

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,970
you pull down that lovely Linux ISO you

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,559
want to cache it somewhere in memory so

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,860
that's what you can do in ram disk and

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:46,090
you can preset you are eyes in the

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,039
firmware so if you're making a

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,440
commercial product and you have the big

00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:52,720
emergency button that goes to automated

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,750
recovery over the Internet's when you

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,100
push that you already have a URL set and

00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,200
you already have your certificates

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,730
pre-populated so it goes to a known

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,919
place based on known certificates pi-1

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:09,700
point for a that's the errata for the

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,649
under the hood packaging stuff and we

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,140
also get into et k2 implementation

00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:18,539
issues such as upgrading open SSL and

00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,539
getting to NASM which makes me so happy

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:26,140
okay that is the facts and figures part

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,220
of the show now somebody had intel

00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,899
thought it was important enough to put

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,520
me on an airplane and send me here so

00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,380
there must be some philosophical reason

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,000
why this is kind of personally important

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,950
to me I've been doing it for twenty

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,539
years it's not just because I like

00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,820
paying off my mortgage turns out I do

00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:42,460
I'm a big fan of food

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,520
trip has not helped that at all because

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:49,240
of buffets but I actually I got into

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:54,130
firmer kind of by accident I started out

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,810
in speech recognition and in 1994 to

00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,370
1996 getting your master's in speech

00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,780
recognition meant that you've built

00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,390
something that was bundled with a sound

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:05,650
blaster card and it didn't work really

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:07,840
well one of my roommates had the problem

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:11,080
of installing his speech recognition

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,730
package on Windows 3.1 ball and someone

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,540
his roommate will walk through the room

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,510
and go shut down from like across the

00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,450
kitchen and the computer would turn off

00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,770
so that was a bad idea so I got out of

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,340
it because it never worked like it would

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,170
on Star Trek

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,700
Captain Kirk made that look easy you

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,560
just walk in and he would say something

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,680
to the computer and it would work be

00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,850
perfect so I got out of it because I

00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,220
didn't think it was gonna work out that

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,330
well I was thought I would spend 20

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,100
years working on something was actually

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,750
functional turns out that's the only

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,450
timeline prediction I've ever made in

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:47,080
the industry that's correct

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,940
and I met roadmaps all the time but in

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,530
2002 I actually had my career choices

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,860
validated by William Shatner he was a

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,570
guest speaker at IDF and he went on this

00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,100
long rant about speech recognition when

00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,080
I asked him a question about what

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,140
technology and Star Trek do you think

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,730
we'll never get replicated properly and

00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,110
I use speech recognition the example he

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,580
ran it for 10 minutes about him it was a

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,080
terrible thing it never worked like he

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,840
was supposed to cuz he always got hired

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,150
to do the demo at the show and it always

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,580
failed probably something about the time

00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,950
in between phrases before it thought you

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,900
were done with the sentence and at that

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,220
point he looked at me and said why

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,600
didn't you fix it I said I couldn't

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,510
that's why I went into this and he said

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,060
good job next question so Captain Kirk

00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:31,560
validated my choice to go into firmware

00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:33,640
so I've stuck with it for a while you

00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,290
have all been asking this now for

00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:42,160
roughly 29 minutes so let's get to the

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:43,120
punchline I don't care about building

00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,050
standards I kept rebuilding

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,190
infrastructure this is fairly important

00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,330
because a lot of the work that we do

00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,700
especially if you're into embedded

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,120
systems nobody sees what you do unless

00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,040
it breaks

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,870
so when people talk about UEFI on

00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,970
Twitter do you think it's yay I had the

00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,910
best experience installing Yocto on my

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:06,750
system no no they don't they talk about

00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:08,670
the corner cases so I work in a place

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,290
where if I do my job properly nobody

00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,360
notices it I normally call this a

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,560
stoplight problem if I go in and I

00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,930
change all the stop lights from

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,000
incandescent bulbs to LEDs if I did the

00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,560
job right only the Nerds notice ooh

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,210
there's a lot of dots in there it's

00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,280
gonna save them about 28% on their power

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,110
bills over a month-by-month basis most

00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,690
people just kind of go oh crap it's

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,340
yellow and speed up I care about

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,890
infrastructure I care about having a

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,320
stable platform so when I take a trip to

00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,300
Vegas I'm doing this and not sitting in

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,250
the audience crying because somebody is

00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:43,020
doing a zero-day report on what I worked

00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:44,340
on when I started working at Intel I

00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,680
spent a lot of time in our Dupont

00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,260
Washington office across from this is

00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,630
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge it is an

00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,640
impressive feat of Engineering when I

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:56,100
say the word Tacoma Narrows most people

00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,750
don't think about this this is the

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,900
second version of the Tacoma Narrows

00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,640
Bridge the first one if you have the

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,250
History Channel in your hotel television

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,140
sometimes you see this version this is

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,370
galloping gertie

00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,530
this was the first version of the Tacoma

00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,560
Narrows Bridge still at the time a feat

00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:17,160
of Engineering with one small design

00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,820
flaw people tested the wind this way

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:23,220
they didn't test the wind this way and

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:28,650
it's on a river in a place that rains a

00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:30,120
lot so it started torsion issues I think

00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,960
is the term they used when I was briefly

00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,450
a mechanical engineering student this

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,480
didn't turn out well and people don't

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,580
care about infrastructure they care

00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,190
about rock star programmers rock star

00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:47,610
programmers I played in a band in

00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,470
college I played drums so even if my

00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:52,620
band became famous I was never gonna be

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,900
a rock star let's be honest I was my own

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,790
roadie I would go and play a gig on

00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,050
Thursday nights we'd open for an a band

00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,490
that we really liked and I would leave

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,590
before their set was done to go back to

00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,070
the lab and finish simulations in MATLAB

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:06,809
I wasn't gonna be a rock star

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:10,769
and I bring this up and I apologize

00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:11,519
my cohorts watching on YouTube we did

00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,379
this to ourselves

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,240
specifically we the people that paid me

00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:18,450
to be here we created this impression

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,909
that what you do in the industry you

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,370
have to do the big things and you have

00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:25,559
to be like super famous and get invited

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,230
to do better keynotes than this and

00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:30,659
that's how you become the programmer

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:33,269
it's about Flash it's not about

00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:35,159
stability it's not about the the basic

00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:36,809
structure that things get built on so

00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,340
everybody tries to do this

00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:42,720
and they kind of skip a lot of the

00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,970
fundamentals and the thing that does

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,100
this the worst to me is the cloud I'm

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,690
sorry I'm in marketing the cloud the

00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,139
cloud has always talked about in hushed

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,580
whispers and and like the cloud is magic

00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:55,649
the cloud keeps a lot of things I'm

00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,720
building a cloud ecosystem to back up my

00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:59,490
cat videos there was actually a guide

00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,869
VMware at a conference that you kept

00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,330
doing hand motions with the cloud it

00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:05,369
drove me crazy but the cloud is this

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,360
sort of like it's this personification

00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:07,860
of something we've been doing for

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,960
decades of course my stuff's in the

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,389
cloud ie it's on another computer

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,320
because I'm not an idiot I back my files

00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:18,749
up and the cloud is this kind of

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,730
Rockstar that we've created we did we

00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:23,659
want to think about all the cool things

00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:26,129
that we do and we miss the fundamentals

00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:27,869
Matthew Garrett's friend of mine we

00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:31,889
worked a lot together on early days of

00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:33,779
UEFI and his hobby is finding IOT

00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:36,299
devices that haven't done their security

00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:38,940
well and publicly talking about how to

00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,169
break them one of my favorite Matthew

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,119
Garrett moments is him sitting in a

00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,249
hotel room and live tweeting hacking the

00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:45,570
lighting control system to the point

00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:47,759
where he figured out the IP address

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:51,029
scheme figured out that the IP address

00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,440
was floor number dot room number and it

00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:53,789
kept opening and closing his boss's

00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,820
blinds because he knew which room he was

00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:58,379
in

00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,720
that's the cloud there are three types

00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:02,460
of cloud of course there's the cloud

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,840
there was the fog which I spent some

00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,799
time in Portland earlier this week I'm

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,049
familiar with the fog that's how

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,129
machines talk to machines and of course

00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:09,480
there's the smog which is where

00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:12,419
everybody keeps their pornography but I

00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,369
am NOT going to talk about that what I

00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:18,029
do like about the community that I'm in

00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:19,950
is that we know about plumbing and we

00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,620
focus on plumbing we think about this

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,340
infrastructure

00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:27,820
baseline so Linux community for years is

00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,320
called abate plumbers conference they

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,820
acknowledge that upfront and that's

00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,990
where their best people go if you want

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,820
to go to a Linux conference talk to a

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,200
kernel developer you go to plumbers

00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:39,250
conference good sad I can't go this year

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,900
there are people have talked about blue

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,450
collar coding they're people remind us

00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,380
that you know if the plumbing is not

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,840
good you get cholera

00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:51,790
yeah a cholera no nobody's ever cared

00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:53,980
for cholera before so a a wise man once

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:57,120
said firmware isn't sexy its plumbing

00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:59,470
okay I said that so skip the wise part

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,360
this is what we have to think about when

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,590
we do any low-level work and we have to

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,540
think about it without any sense of

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,309
shame or any sense of like oh I'm not

00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,080
gonna be a higher level programmer I'm

00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:09,610
not gonna write JSON code that goes to

00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,220
the cloud and fixes whatever problem

00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:14,950
with my thermostat plumbing is

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,850
super-important at breakfast I was

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,190
talking with one of the Lennar Oh

00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,480
conference organizers and he'd seen the

00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,710
presentation said oh thank you for

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,240
mentioning plumbing and told me all the

00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,300
horror stories of his house plumbing how

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,860
he came back three weeks after a trip to

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,040
mold because the plumbing leaked in the

00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,909
walls very slowly while they were away

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,950
not a pleasant story to hear at

00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,510
breakfast but anyway this is kind of the

00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,570
example of doing the fundamental things

00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:39,840
right and being okay when they stay

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:42,520
invisible and just structure works

00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,110
people didn't care about plumbing and

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,389
then they moved to Flint Michigan and

00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:49,990
then everybody suddenly cared about

00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,310
plumbing so when you say I'm gonna be a

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,600
plumber but I'm gonna be a cool plumber

00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,270
I'm gonna be a famous plumber I'm gonna

00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,679
be one of the Mario Brothers so when I

00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,560
talk to people of a certain age

00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,620
hi I'm of a certain age you remember

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,570
running around as a red or if your

00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:08,980
brother Gotham Tendo first green suited

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:11,050
plumber you were not a plumber I mean

00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:15,160
this is a plumber who primarily got

00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:16,810
famous for dealing with a primate that

00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,960
stole his girlfriend who threw barrels

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:21,040
at him none of this is plumbing he goes

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,100
to the wrong address

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,340
he breaks infrastructure Mario and Luigi

00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:30,970
are the worst plumbers they do none of

00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:33,490
their job and they are somehow famous so

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,780
as a plumber maybe they're not your role

00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,210
model

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:41,510
because if you think you're these guys

00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:43,010
you're probably these guys I don't

00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,049
really think you want to end up in that

00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,430
position you need to focus on what your

00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:49,700
job is actually supposed to be which is

00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:51,500
making the infrastructure work and

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,799
that's what really I learned to love

00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,420
about doing firmware is I got to work on

00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:58,880
this base line that made it possible

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,520
that when Windows 8 came out the entire

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,069
world went maybe I should try Linux and

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,690
they could they could just pick up the

00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:07,190
PC they bought off the shelf for the

00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,630
most part and work some problems out

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,940
it's getting better but they could just

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,010
take that for something on a CD or USB

00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,299
and try it out and they say well I'm

00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,260
gonna try a bun too and they got on the

00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,700
internet forum and said they're gonna

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,200
try a bun too and a lot of people yelled

00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,220
at them and so they tried Debbie until

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,109
they tried fedora and by the time they

00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,609
got all that sorted out they're like

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:24,109
well yeah this is pretty cool than

00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:26,599
Windows 10 came out maybe they went back

00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:29,660
to that maybe they didn't the point is

00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,809
this kind of stable framework means that

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:35,299
you have more choices from a development

00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:37,640
standpoint if this middle layer can be

00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:39,859
solid if the firmware in the root of

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,420
trust can be standardized your work and

00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:44,540
your focus as a developer is either on

00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,569
one side of that layer or the other if I

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:50,720
do my job right your work is making your

00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:52,220
product function so you can focus on the

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,230
cloud you can focus on the things that

00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,619
people really buy your products for a

00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:59,150
lot of people in the room make boards

00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:02,089
consumers don't buy boards consumers buy

00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,339
products that buy experiences and if

00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:06,410
everything below that is done properly

00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:07,930
then their experience is maintained and

00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,940
they get what they actually paid for

00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:12,049
which is consistent computing the things

00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,390
that we're gonna work on in the future

00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:15,440
aren't gonna be like flashy laptops and

00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,630
gaming systems they're gonna be this

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,549
kind of invisible infrastructure devices

00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:22,730
they're gonna be things that you talk to

00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:24,140
to order pizza or a little beacons that

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,790
make things work for you they're gonna

00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,260
be thermostats they're they're gonna be

00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:30,049
like the weird things that make that

00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,980
transparent futuristic life possible

00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:33,140
they're gonna be the things that make

00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,540
Captain Kirk be able to talk to a

00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,390
computer and give him exactly what he

00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:42,710
asked for even if he didn't quite phrase

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:44,960
it correctly so this is why we

00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:47,810
standardize things so if we standardize

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,960
the firmware if we put out a good base

00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:52,790
lair for how you can do it in the open I

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,440
don't care if you build in the kitchen

00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,090
sink or the cool pedestal sink or that

00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,180
marble bathroom to my hotel room which

00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:02,030
is really nice I care that that pipe

00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,400
that the base line of this is what it's

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:07,550
exactly supposed to be that everything

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,840
fits within that framework so I don't

00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:11,090
care that another company can drop a

00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:16,100
sink on it I care that it's stable so

00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:17,330
that anybody can drop a sink on it so we

00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,710
talked about firmware which probably

00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,180
wasn't what you were expecting after

00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,480
breakfast but congratulations for

00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:27,590
sticking around I just want to leave you

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:30,020
with three thoughts about this one is

00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,610
that the work that we're doing in tiana

00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,980
core is the idea to make you if I'm more

00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,810
open so that what you rely on as that

00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,760
base if everything above that layer is

00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,140
open-source I want to try to work on

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,280
making everything as far down as

00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:45,200
possible open second is this is a

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,640
community-based effort you're gonna find

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,500
things I didn't think of you're gonna

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,630
find things Leif and Mike and Andrew

00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,520
didn't think of that's why opens good

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,590
you're gonna see things from a different

00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,760
perspective if I spend all my days in

00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,620
the trenches you could see what it's

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,580
like its street level and then that

00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:02,810
makes everything better

00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:06,130
and third it's okay to be a plumber most

00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,130
of the time thank you

00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:20,490
okay okay just a few announcements and

00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:29,370
we'll get going you guys could switch

00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:31,560
over excellent thank you okay so the

00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:33,960
first thing is we're really excited to

00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,700
welcome a special guest and that's Liz

00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,110
Torvalds is joining us for the next

00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:45,930
couple of days so please join me in

00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:47,730
welcoming Glynnis so he said attendee

00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,110
here just like everyone else you see

00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,240
them on during the sessions and the

00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:53,310
things that interest him and we should

00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,170
have a good next couple of days as we've

00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:57,750
been planning there is a fireside chat

00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,790
tomorrow that lettuce and Dave are going

00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,950
to host and it's really based around

00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:05,220
your questions so there is now I am told

00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:07,320
with great confidence a box or questions

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,670
box out at the registration desk so if

00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,800
you have any questions and I'm sure many

00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,270
of you do please just write them down

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,010
and put them out in the box and we'll

00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,180
include them as part of the fireside

00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:18,960
chat tomorrow that should be a lot of

00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,370
fun so today is networking day here I

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,410
like that I like the way that that's

00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:24,840
quit but today is actually officially

00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,610
lng darrell and our networking group day

00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,100
and there's lots of sessions this

00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:31,650
morning up until lunch around networking

00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,820
this is also the third mini conference

00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,710
day the third and final mini conference

00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,140
day the mini conference today is about

00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,880
AOSP I've heard really great feedback

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,190
about many conferences in the first two

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,510
days so as sort of this new concept

00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,040
within Connect it seems to really be

00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,110
working if you're interested in the AOSP

00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,200
I encourage you to go Grand Ballroom Dee

00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,310
after this and that will go until

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,350
lunchtime with some very interesting

00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,640
sessions there if you haven't picked up

00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,620
your t-shirt by the end of the day today

00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,650
or you want a bottle I think you

00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,450
probably don't want it all so Dave's

00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,860
puzzle so take a look at the puzzle

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:06,270
inside your program guide if you have

00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:07,560
any thoughts about the puzzle you think

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,940
you could calculate an answer you have a

00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,770
pretty good guess you can turn those in

00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,420
over at the registration desk we'll

00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,760
announce the winner or winners tomorrow

00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,700
and fabulous prizes of course will be

00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,130
involve all tonight at 7 o'clock

00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:24,359
poolside outside which should be really

00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:26,789
nice we have the fabulous Viva Las Vegas

00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,319
dinner we've used the same format that

00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:30,509
we did in Bangkok in terms of it's not a

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,579
seated dinner there'll be food stations

00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:34,410
and places to talk and chat there will

00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,859
be little chairs around to sit down and

00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:40,109
informally so it should be a fun time

00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:42,299
also we're encouraging everyone to dress

00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:43,739
up fancy so if you have something fancy

00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:46,499
to wear if you're capable of

00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:47,970
impersonating Elvis or even Liberace we

00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:49,529
would encourage you to come and do so if

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,970
you're not and you don't have anything

00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:52,829
fancy to wear that's just fine you're

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,950
just as welcome but there will be prizes

00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:58,470
that will be awarded for those who who

00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:01,200
find special ways to represent

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:04,739
themselves in terms of dress fancy dress

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,900
at the event of course at the event it's

00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,670
also now our tradition to well to

00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,869
recognize those folks who have been

00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,059
involved with llanera

00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:13,499
for five years or more now and that's

00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:15,359
not just for employees but also for

00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:18,089
folks in the community so we always look

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,380
forward to doing that and then just to

00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:21,569
let you know that tomorrow is demo

00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,489
Friday as is our tradition for since

00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:24,660
almost the beginning I said thanks since

00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:27,779
the beginning actually as far as I can

00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,970
remember and because of the 96 board's

00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:31,680
availability there are more demos than

00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,569
ever we're really excited and there are

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,730
some really interesting demos food gets

00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:38,039
served during demo Friday it should be a

00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,380
real it should be the best demo Friday

00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:41,880
we've seen today in terms of both volume

00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,170
and interesting things that people have

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,160
been doing with these boards and others

00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:49,200
so be prepared for that tomorrow one of

00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,519
the things that Robert wolf and Chauvin

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,230
have done if you haven't seen it we've

00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:54,900
been building the 96 board's community

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:58,049
so they've been hosting these 96 boards

00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,369
open hours on the network and it's

00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:01,380
really been building up to the point

00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,670
where now almost a hundred people are

00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,259
showing up but every one of these things

00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,029
and they thought it would be interesting

00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:07,950
let's do one live here since we're all

00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:10,230
here together let's do one live from

00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:12,420
connect so we'll be doing it live of

00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:15,359
this afternoon starting at 2 o'clock in

00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:17,430
this ballroom here and so in addition to

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,809
people on the network well we have

00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,059
people here live in the audience

00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:22,470
yourselves and them and we think it will

00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,089
make for a really interesting event so

00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,039
if 96 boards is of any interest to you

00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:28,079
you can ask any questions make any

00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,460
comment provide feedback it's a really

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,980
great community forum I'd encourage you

00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,960
to be here so I'm gonna just turn it

00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,700
over to George to share with us welcome

00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,130
made a huge announcement this week and

00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,470
it has wide-ranging impact and

00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:47,700
is gonna sort of share some analysis of

00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:49,559
this announcement with us thanks Joe so

00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,359
we've obviously been working with

00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:55,589
Qualcomm for a long time that one of our

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,970
core members we are very appreciative of

00:43:55,589 --> 00:44:00,869
all the support they've given us in the

00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:03,690
open-source community the Snapdragon

00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:06,930
embedded processor announcement was made

00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,759
I think it was yesterday and this is

00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,589
going to I hope have a really big impact

00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:12,930
the exciting thing about this is that

00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:14,940
for the first time Qualcomm are making

00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:17,609
their mainstream mobile devices

00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,009
available as embedded products with

00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:21,859
support for ten years and you can just

00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:24,240
go and buy them from distribution and

00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:25,829
hopefully as a result of that there'll

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,869
be great documentation and we can do

00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:30,990
some really interesting things with with

00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:32,250
these devices and as I say for the first

00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:35,220
time you can just go and buy them from

00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,960
aro one by one by a thousand build

00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,299
anything you want and I think some of

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,059
the dragon board community board work

00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:45,650
we've been doing is really gonna help

00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:48,000
this because companies and makers and

00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,740
developers can take the software that

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,650
we've built for the board and reuse it

00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:55,380
completely open-source on the product

00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:59,599
products they make so yay Qualcomm well

00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,599
done I think this is a great move Thanks

00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,660
if there's any more information there's

00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,819
a bunch of Qualcomm guys here tear

00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,250
Cosette who heads up this program in

00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:14,039
Qualcomm is also available find her ask

00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:17,490
her questions and I'm sure she'd be

00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:18,869
happy to talk to you thanks there's also

00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,279
a really good announcement and an

00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:22,309
interesting and relevant announcement

00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:24,359
for everybody from SG micro and

00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:27,529
Christian Berta who is going to share a

00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,529
little bit of insight with us on that

00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:40,829
good morning so we are announcing the

00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:44,250
availability of these tools called

00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:47,250
Otto's tools we presented them at the

00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:51,509
last connect in Bangkok we stools are

00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:52,079
working on on Linux photos by default

00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:56,670
photos

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,890
and GCC and LLVM compiler or cos

00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,630
compilers

00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:03,119
they automate the goal of these tools is

00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:08,039
to automatically find the best

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:10,469
configuration flags for achieving the

00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,910
best performance of the best cut size or

00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:15,299
the best trade-off between performance

00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:20,549
and concise for a given program with a

00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:23,009
given with a given set of inputs so in

00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:28,759
fact it's based on the machine learning

00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:32,880
and it uses a tool to call pute which

00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:38,849
does a system quality in interception -

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:45,299
to change the flag of the also used by

00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:49,440
the user without without without the

00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:52,140
user knowing that this is done the

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,989
original aspect of these tools is that

00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,779
they they do not require any change to

00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:59,999
the build system of the program any

00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:02,640
change with the source of the program to

00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:04,559
find the best configuration file the

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,799
best configuration Flags so to

00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:11,430
illustrate that I show you the results

00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:15,420
of the on this slide of an exploration

00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:20,519
on the I think it's on GCC it's not

00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:22,709
written there but it's the optimization

00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,920
of the Z glib library of the Linux

00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:31,259
distribution and you can see on this

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:33,269
slide that there are many points which

00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:37,019
correspond each time to a new

00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:39,559
configuration sets of flags you can see

00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:43,739
in the middle of the slide you have the

00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:47,009
reference point which is the the value

00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:49,319
to the state of the program when you

00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:51,989
don't change anything when you when you

00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:57,390
you just make anyone and you can see

00:47:51,989 --> 00:48:00,029
that if the code sizing is reduced it's

00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:03,959
getting on the right is the code size if

00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:06,030
the code is faster it's getting to

00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:08,730
towards the top

00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:11,220
we can see here the best performance to

00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:14,340
trade-off between code size and the in

00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:21,470
performance and another observation is

00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:28,770
that so default value of free of OS and

00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:32,040
o2 are not very well very well set up in

00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:36,390
this case so that's it the code is

00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:38,190
available on github at the previews at

00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:41,810
the address written on the previous

00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:45,240
slide and everything is in place for

00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:50,580
receiving contribution we have a CI loop

00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:53,670
which tests and we have anything in

00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,680
place for receiving pull pull request so

00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:59,360
that's it enjoy and if you have

00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,360
questions don't hesitate to add to us

00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:10,260
okay just to close us out I thought that

00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,700
since we are in Vegas this week and we

00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,500
are all mathematicians because software

00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,720
is math at the end of the day right that

00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:18,240
we just had to take a quick look at some

00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,540
of the aspects of gambling in Vegas so

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:25,380
so why don't we do that so table games

00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,760
by rule by calculation are clearly have

00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,110
much better odds if you're gonna play

00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,040
anything play one of the table games

00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,510
they may be a little bit more

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,740
intimidating because there are live

00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,420
people involved there are other people

00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,610
playing but they have much better odds

00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,590
and slot machines and in general if you

00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:39,030
look at all the table games the best

00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,190
odds of winning and this has been

00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:43,230
analyzed to death over the years is

00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:45,900
really blackjack there's really only a

00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,580
1% edge that the house has in blackjack

00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,980
so you have the best chance of winning

00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:52,290
in blackjack in general it varies a

00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,550
little bit by by casino depending upon

00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,950
the rules or the number of ducks they

00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:57,570
use but 1% is generally considered crops

00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:59,430
are dice is the next it's a very

00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,750
complicated game I tried to learn a

00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,190
little bit myself tonight and I knew

00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,540
they were I know there were some some

00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,860
people that were mastering it out there

00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,900
and it's a pretty interesting game

00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:10,800
that's the next best it's about 50/50

00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:12,060
roulette is the third best odds and you

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,530
get thirty six to one if you can guess

00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,960
the number but if you just bet red or

00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:18,390
black it's almost 50% of course it's

00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,980
almost 50% because the house also has to

00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,079
keep something as well

00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,550
and and slots are interesting because we

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,560
have you know I think we all have

00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:27,570
experienced this week getting up at 7:00

00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,119
or 7:30 in the morning and seeing little

00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:31,650
old ladies with walkers in at the slot

00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:35,369
machine smoking their cigarettes at

00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:36,869
these crazy hours right and and slot

00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:40,260
machines are actually the worst from an

00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:41,550
odds perspective and we'll a fortune

00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,810
which is a show in the u.s. I don't know

00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:45,000
if that translates to other countries

00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:49,500
but the wheel of fortune slot machine by

00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,730
far is the is the most popular slot

00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,079
machine of any slot machine in the

00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,310
history of slot machines and you'll see

00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,380
a bunch of them out there and at every

00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:57,390
consumer but they're also set up so that

00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,470
there are they're usually the worst odds

00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:02,060
if you're gonna play a slot machine

00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:05,670
that's really not the one to play and

00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,839
there's a lot inve in Nevada that the

00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:09,480
slot machines have to pay out at least

00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:11,520
70% 75% of what they take in so they

00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,589
can't they can't rig the slot machines

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,790
completely against you the worst case is

00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:17,490
it's gonna pay out seventy five percent

00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,960
and the other interesting thing here

00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:22,079
that I found was the more they can

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,000
adjust of course the odds on on winning

00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,150
and what you win and how often you win

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,560
and and the more money you put in so in

00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:31,109
other words the slot machines that take

00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,099
the higher denominations a dollar five

00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:34,290
dollars or more

00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:35,819
pay out more than others and the other

00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:39,119
thing that you'll notice here in terms

00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:42,150
of comparing the different denomination

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,650
slot machines is you don't get as good a

00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,540
payoff if you go down to the strip and

00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:48,599
some of those fabulous bright casinos

00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,849
like the Mirage or Caesars or the

00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:53,310
Bellagio and whatnot those don't pay out

00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:55,619
as much as the slot machines will in

00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:57,210
locations here in North Las Vegas and

00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,069
these are some of the facts you can see

00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:00,510
there's a few percent difference between

00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:02,369
what goes on down there and what goes on

00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:04,440
here so one of the things you'll find

00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,390
then you can see that out there is you

00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,520
don't get a lot of tourists here but the

00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:10,680
locals when they go to play and they do

00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,240
play they're gonna go to a local casino

00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,680
because they know they're gonna get

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,670
better odds and they will down at the

00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,750
strip so that's just a little bit about

00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,819
about some of the aspects of the games

00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:23,250
that are going on here as we have our

00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:24,750
meetings and and and it gives you a

00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:27,060
little bit of background anyways so

00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,790
that's it for today remember this 7

00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,829
o'clock tonight at the poolside the gala

00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:32,880
and tomorrow we're gonna start about 15

00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:33,720
minutes early so we're going to start

00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,690
here tomorrow morning

00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:39,680
for a last day on Friday at 8:30 have a

00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,680
