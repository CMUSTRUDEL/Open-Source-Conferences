	LAS16-311: Window Based Load Tracking (WALT) versus PELT utilization
Speakers: Vikram Mulukutla
Date: September 28, 2016

★ Session Description ★
Continuing the discussion from Linaro Connect Bangkok 2016, we discuss further experiments with Window Assisted Load Tracking (WALT, formerly WinLT) on other architectures such as x86 and with different workloads including laptop/desktop and server usecases. We propose that WALT is more accurate in tracking cpu/task utilization than PELT (which we believe is better at load rather than util tracking) and that better utilization estimation schemes can be built on top of WALT. Experiments use the new schedutil governor. Examination of individual use cases in detail as well as how to handle migration and potential caveats of a windowing scheme are discussed.
