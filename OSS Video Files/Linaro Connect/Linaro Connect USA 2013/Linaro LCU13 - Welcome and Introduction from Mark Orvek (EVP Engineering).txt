we've made thursday in all teams day so

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,000
what we've learned from

previous connects is that the teams

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,880
actually have some interesting topics

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,920

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,840
wednesday sessions

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
so we want to give the teams freedom to

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,880
use thursday

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,720
to re to get together to have some

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,320
follow-up sessions there's also going to

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,479
be a lot of development going on

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
during the week in their hacking rooms

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,840
but also thursday is free

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,759
for them to also do some more

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,680
development

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,040
