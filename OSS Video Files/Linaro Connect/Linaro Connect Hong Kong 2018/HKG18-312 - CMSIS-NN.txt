Session Name: HKG18-312 - CMSIS-NN
Speaker: Rod Crawford
Track: LEG;Ecosystem Day


★ Session Summary ★
Deep learning algorithms are gaining popularity in IoT edge devices, because of their human-level accuracy in many applications, such as image classification and speech recognition. There is an increasing interest in deploying neural networks (NN) on always-on systems such as Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers. In this session, we introduce the challenges of deploying neural networks on microcontrollers with limited memory/compute resources and power budget. We introduce CMSIS-NN, optimized software kernels to enable deployment of neural networks on Cortex-M cores. We further present NN architecture exploration, using keyword spotting application as an example, to develop light-weight models suitable for resource constrained systems.
