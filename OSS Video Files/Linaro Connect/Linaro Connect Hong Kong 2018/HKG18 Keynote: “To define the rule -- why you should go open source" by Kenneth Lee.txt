[Applause]

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:18,230
okay

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:22,260
this topic is mentioned in TLC years ago

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:25,650
many of us do not know the idea behind a

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,599
pan sauce and we have a lot of new comer

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,090
they keep asking the same question about

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,719
why I come here to join this activity

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:38,610
then I try to explain that here once

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:41,640
again and hope I help you so this

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,910
presentation is about why you are here

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,370
and how can you explain to your manager

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,399
you are here for work not for vocation

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,190
because I keep asked him by my manager

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,949
all my friends see 10 you go to Las

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:01,320
Vegas so cool right so if you are the

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,449
manager then I try to explain how you

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,010
and your organization kept benefit by

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:12,659
joining the open source activity this is

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,150
me I joined for about 20 years and most

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,990
of my career as well as a Software

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:23,159
Architect for Powys product and Telecom

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,290
product so this is a share about open

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:33,350
source from business software architect

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:36,750
and I proud to say most of my product

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,939
were well broadly within highway almost

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,880
most of it how is networking equipment

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,880
used my operating system distribution

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:51,119
and also I were busily narrow for about

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:55,829
this year I get the plane last year and

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:59,100
when I call it I leave that day to

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:02,460
immediately and my friends asked me hi

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:07,969
Ken why you don't you cheer on the stage

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:11,480
and then I took them oh my god I forgot

00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:14,480
this is normally the basic culture of

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,720
China people do not want to be focused

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,290
but they don't know why and I try to

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,470
explain to you that's come from a very

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,780
older Chinese poker court oddity and

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,239
there is a stamen inside is a threat

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,670
always go to the reverse direction of

00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,920
its name if you caught something

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,890
yeah can you have good that means can

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:42,170
you are so bad

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:45,230
let's see why 13 is a very popular book

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:48,170
in China almost air we often know some

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,379
of the statement it a little lighter

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,140
Bible in the best culture but most of

00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,390
Chinese do not read it and they do not

00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:01,040
know was talking about because it's

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:05,120
something mysterious this it in the

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:09,319
title is his first statement literally

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,019
he said tau can be tau and tau okay wait

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,329
a row can be wrote a name can be named

00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:16,670
but it's not the general role or not the

00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:19,250
general way and you don't know what it's

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:23,239
talking about but it's concept is simple

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:26,540
this said when we see the world we we

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,829
hit by the sensor we see a lot of data

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,590
of the world

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:33,590
but when we start to think about it or

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:38,329
we try to talk about it we use a name

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:41,900
but name is network the fetcher is never

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:46,280
the reality so if we you investigate the

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,370
name and mate is shining the feather

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,560
will be off the name and you investigate

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:55,389
on the Fed itself you will change the

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:59,180
FET and the name will not be there so

00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:02,690
this sort we're talking about the world

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,750
always think about the world by the name

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:08,660
by the Fed but actually that's just a

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:12,109
name is not the Fed the Fed always be

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,290
off you if you really push hard on the

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:17,930
name itself so it's very easy to make

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,570
confusion when I talk about something I

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,769
talk about the name but you have to make

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,910
sure the name

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:29,330
- the reality open source is almost the

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:32,300
same concert here you talk about open

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,610
source you refer to the source itself

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,509
you are not talking about open yourself

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:44,150
so I let you know why this has happened

00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,750
see when we start to bring a name no

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,990
Molly

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,810
you are in cities you feel interesting

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,690
for a pattern you see something you want

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,569
to talk about you create a name if you

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,599
are not eating there at all then you

00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:03,289
don't be a name so normally a name is a

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:05,389
problem people when people see the name

00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:09,259
they try to solve the problem she tried

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:12,849
to turn it good or bad or higher or

00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:16,310
shorter or longer

00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:18,590
sorry higher or lower and longer or

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,800
shorter they always talk about to change

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,819
the name from left to right or from

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,289
right to left

00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:30,770
they try to make his effort according to

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:33,080
Ted but by dada team he set about that

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:36,830
if you really want to solve the problem

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,430
the view behavior you need to do is you

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,710
turn it off because when you make

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:48,080
something quit it should be something

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:51,110
better compared to this good so if you

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,719
really solve a problem you should turn

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:57,409
the name of you should you you should

00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:59,840
not strengthen it you try to be harder

00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:00,979
like over sources you try to do open

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,569
source harder

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:09,469
that means you fail to make your private

00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:12,710
code better or your product better so

00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:18,979
it's not the normal way using span your

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:21,740
efforts on open source okay now we come

00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:26,690
back to see what is a gradual design is

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:30,740
I do open source for a non dasari I do

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,620
it has a design for about 15 years and

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,480
then my understand two identities sign

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,290
is too

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,740
sign and maintain a lot logic chain to

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:45,550
fulfill your final goal you want to make

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:48,760
a good and use broadly then you see

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,220
clear logical for the first year you

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,840
have some software and then second year

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,790
you have the hardware ready and the

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,730
third year your hope your customers you

00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,810
can topper your solution that you have a

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:06,450
lot of dependency and fit and we try to

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:10,390
push our engineer software engineering

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:14,920
to make something happen but as a cadet

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:19,180
my work is to make sure we don't need to

00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,610
do everything because if you do is

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,820
empower yourself then you will spend all

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:28,000
your efforts to make Mason's happen and

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:31,600
then you've lost the chip of how to how

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,050
to achieve the cope so normally when I

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:41,500
work so many years the season engineer

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:44,950
is to make that happen but I get happy

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:52,870
to make things do not happen do not be

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:56,580
to happen so normally most of our my

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,620
manager or my colleague they will aware

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,200
the season engineer do a lot of things

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,640
they have the name but normally they

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,970
don't a ver architect to him because we

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,650
our job is to turn the name of only we

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:16,990
turn the name of we can reach the goal

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,330
so many many said in Chinese helped

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:22,720
people to not believe anything but

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,090
actually they do they believe that the

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,330
editing of the world and they caught

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:31,870
their doubt because it is a road lead

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:36,160
lead you to the goal but if you follow

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:39,099
the goal follow the town you follow the

00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:43,090
reality then you have no name then

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:46,120
that's the way to to make successful to

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,330
make things happen and to change the

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,330
world

00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:57,560
so now we can explain why you do open

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,449
source you have a bunch of a private

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,779
source code to keep it safe

00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:04,459
it won't be if you cannot ensure the

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,519
development direction of the ecosystem

00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:11,689
you have a lot of very good code by to

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,629
use it then how can you sell to the good

00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:17,420
to your customer that's the reason you

00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:20,180
joined opens of activity it does the

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:24,819
missile open sources is so good in this

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:28,810
is the way people can join together to

00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:32,750
to make the geo system look right and

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,029
many people ask them I come to De Niro

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,009
want to taste some code because they

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:41,209
have some private code key inside the

00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:43,339
repository but no there's no right if

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,629
you want to tell at all you can stay at

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,350
your home and then you can take it

00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:51,829
immediately this is not the reason you

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,319
come here and you are not going to

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:57,380
develop the code together with your

00:09:54,319 --> 00:10:01,790
competitor you won't try her in this

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:04,910
case and the source code without trying

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:08,329
ha made no sense for you to rely on I

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:12,529
find that a lot of project open source

00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:14,540
project and activity failed at last

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,880
because it from the very beginning

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,009
people do not want to contribute

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,519
anything they want to taste something

00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,149
then there is nothing there then how can

00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,149
you take it

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:30,470
so finally you spend a lot of effort and

00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:33,350
you want to cheat the others and hope

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,630
but the others join and will have for

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,240
you and then you want to take it you

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,630
never get it right

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,819
you think that's a clever strategy but

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:50,059
that's just a waste of your time and

00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:51,800
also some pillars later they take an

00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,769
asset in order to do something for them

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,150
I don't bring for that because you don't

00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:00,930
sigh a contribution in arrow and then

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:02,880
not delay for you you can do anything if

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,550
you want to do that to just pay

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,130
outsourcing and you can immediately and

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:15,810
if they don't get it on time then you

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:18,960
can right there is some punishment once

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:22,230
again when you come here as in TV to

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,470
meet you and you are a competitor with

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,600
your internal team I always had the same

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,430
problem when I joined here there my

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,740
internist said I can you go to open

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,010
source again you are not belong to me

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,070
you are my competitor and then you

00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:41,010
haven't yet I go there to get some coal

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,230
for you but they're always wrong because

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,570
they can get the code by yourself even

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,690
the color written by you is the reason

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,730
by you but it's already on wesauce right

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:54,150
you can get me immediately and then they

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:58,830
don't need you people me a person only

00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:01,650
he go into an EU is if they already kept

00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,340
anything from you they don't need need

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:08,580
you anymore you become a burden over him

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:10,860
right you get some coal from outside and

00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,860
give it to them and then they we take

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,590
they already Canada they own you they

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,890
need to pay back in the future so that

00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,900
they won't lie to you anymore only when

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:30,090
they need you to take the gold once

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:31,830
again they we like it right and this is

00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,140
their not the question normally people

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,660
we ask me I work for telecom industry

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,600
for a long time and the normal telecom

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,970
industry is joined the open join the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,460
standard organizes all the standard

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,280
nicest way is we send a team to send

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:51,120
organization we persuade they adopt the

00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:56,400
solution and then we get some pattern

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:59,100
from the pattern Bureau and then with

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,820
that implemented pattern then that

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:05,010
that's done so in most cases people just

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,490
write down you need to do it this way

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,230
that's all but today most of this vendor

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,970
organization become open-source

00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,720
community

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:17,600
why because from the beginning the coal

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,970
is driven by requirement you have serial

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,590
function and then you create a free

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,650
Walker to connect all these function

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:27,740
together but after you have their base

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:31,360
of the code then use that achievement by

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:34,550
the competition it's not reasonable

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,180
people need to change the framework or

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:40,820
the function itself everywhere and most

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:50,510
of the code is this kind of in this

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:51,850
style so the the standard way is not

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,740
working anymore

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,320
still we have spent the organization but

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:02,840
it's less unless because too complex

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:10,820
when I work for GSM system MSC note we

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:14,720
have a 300 k ro c 3k 300 line of code

00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:17,780
but now if you take a look in android

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,820
phone and the phone is about 10 times of

00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,590
the code

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:24,290
absolutely when you write the code you

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:27,200
the efficiency is the thing you cannot

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:31,460
enjoy it so today when you get the call

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:34,700
you cannot control any every part of the

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,370
code base you have to change everywhere

00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:43,670
then with our open source community you

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:47,210
can do anything and once again internal

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,360
team always challenge even yesterday my

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:53,870
colleague some of newcomer they asked me

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,750
I can the open source is better we have

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,940
more advantages on that with doing

00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:07,130
better I said yeah you are doing better

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:10,250
but who use it but nobody use it open

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,530
source is that inclusion everybody agree

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:17,210
we should going to use it in this way

00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:21,860
and private branch means you just treat

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:23,360
by yourself in that way so your your

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,209
hope will be

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,019
performance will be better quality

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:32,120
because you fix it up you get open

00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:37,850
source code and you add a lot of a

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:40,579
preparatory solution and and you make it

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,950
fixed you may label you testing for five

00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:45,560
years about solid and maybe five months

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,589
and beliefs to the market yeah it will

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,800
be better quality and better function

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:54,200
but people do not agree with that open

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:59,480
source means people already agree with

00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,190
that then that's why why you can't stay

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,149
for long

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:07,880
normally we have my experience I have a

00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:11,390
detective branch no matter inside or

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,910
outside and then I put the long time

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:16,310
sheet it's there and then internally

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,040
when I sell to the market I have my

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:23,149
branch but that branch I can Alaska for

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,600
maybe five years or six years that's all

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:28,850
it should be end and then you should

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:34,220
take another new beliefs from the

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:37,339
altitude branch so I can save most of my

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,890
time I don't need to put many of a

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:45,430
michael again to the new solution and

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:48,740
then i i i made most of my engineer free

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:54,430
with no name right

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:58,070
i give an example how it is sign the

00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:01,610
external strategy for open source this

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:05,959
is a yuppie from the beginning when we

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:08,120
bring up the idea of yuppie people sing

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,490
oh we are going to make another

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,730
distribution actually if you take a look

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,370
to this picture it's a distribution but

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,829
if we do a distribution we become a

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:22,339
competitor with the other business

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:26,600
distribution provider and then they will

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:29,059
leave the ecosystem then why bother if i

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,720
want to quit and not the competitor it's

00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,850
easy I create another company and then I

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,380
directly sell to the market that's all

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,100
why I bother

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,480
to spend so many resource and putting

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,150
some person in person and try to

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:48,770
persuade them and then create

00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:53,690
distribution just not the sense so this

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:55,910
is it's a real strategy of yaki in Tata

00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:00,770
seen again there is a methodology he

00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:04,760
said singing is solid ok it's all

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:08,720
Chinese he talked about we do something

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,750
with no harm and we try to give benefit

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,390
with known name because when you give

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:18,560
one name you bring the name people on

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,940
you when they own you they hate you you

00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,300
don't want to say they're right but

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,850
actually that's the way so what we try

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,740
to do is we doesn't compete with the

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,990
ecosystem we are not going to create

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,450
another competitor in the ecosystem it's

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,520
not a long term support abortion at each

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,700
abortion is a longtime supporter version

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:42,710
so it's not going to launch in support I

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:47,720
upgrade the relation every half years we

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:52,190
try to make it for half solid happy yes

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,350
we try to make it six months so it will

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,510
be equate the very faster so it is not

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,970
going to be a distribution so it's not

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,610
going to compete with any diffusion and

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,380
it's not a landing project for SLC it

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:10,430
doesn't miss I'm going to support your

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:13,070
SOC it means if I release a new video I

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:18,950
hope your internal associate in joy and

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:20,870
then enable them so they still need to

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,980
do something they need to something they

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,010
are valuable

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,070
so tell you line to join it I'm not I'm

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,450
not going to date just so if I do that

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,600
and no matter they happy or not happy

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:36,140
they will try to avoid to join because

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,910
if I do to also do the same and SLC

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,640
enable team to the same they will

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:46,190
compete again no matter they want to

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:48,320
contemplate on 1 2 so 4 Yawkey this is

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,570
not going to compete with the ecosystem

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,620
but you have to give Benedict to the

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:57,200
Eurosystem so we try to make that happen

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,270
the Chetan is it we only was in that

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,580
sense the Potter latest feature and the

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,760
latest Linux kernel for am server

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,730
hardware you can you can buy er

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,290
distribution but normally this

00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,650
commercial distribution and he will

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:16,430
support maybe one year or two years ago

00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:19,190
technology but if you want to do

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:25,310
something new then he gives you the

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:28,760
benefit and any new feature can be

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:32,630
merged into an SDK version but we are

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:38,510
not previously if you can have it

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:40,160
suppose a associate provider or Linux

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:45,620
distribution provider they want to

00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:48,680
persuade people to use the solution then

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:51,860
tation chaja to MediaHub maybe happens

00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,280
and people can get benefit from that but

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,420
if we denote it by their self the people

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,970
we live this is the cheek of open-source

00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:05,090
you do more people will live but open

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,450
sources way is to let people join it's

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:12,860
not by yourself I remember last year

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:16,280
Jonathan from Alta Brienne the net he

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:20,960
said a maintainer of Lena of open-source

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,760
community is to create a welcome he

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,890
doesn't try to do something for the

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,710
others he tried to do something people

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:31,670
will lie to join you to provide their

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:34,670
effort so it's a variable to join the

00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:37,310
community it's not you provide something

00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:41,240
good to the others so they will join the

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:43,400
community and I also chopped work hard

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,650
to make all the narrow common teacher

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,340
newbie developer and burning fire only

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,730
on yachty

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:52,850
so it's also valuable for you to to join

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:55,430
and then to persuade the others to adopt

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,150
your solution so finally you can

00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,169
compatible with the ecosystem with the

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,419
others

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,309
and if you do everything by your own

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:08,239
then you don't need to join because

00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:10,730
that's your private surgeon people you

00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:14,419
have no need for the other to help you

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:17,239
right so think about that many of our

00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:20,299
open source activity is a waste of time

00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:22,639
if you don't need people to join your

00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:26,899
ecosystem you don't need a government

00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:27,919
source so this is the conclusion again

00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:33,669
I'm sorry

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:38,629
it's a a statement from the other team

00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:40,909
singham was a change is it means the

00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:46,159
best King because 13 is a polka written

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:51,889
to the king the King - not selfish

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,230
selfish so he kept his selfies again
