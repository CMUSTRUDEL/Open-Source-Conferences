Speaker: Renato Golin

★ Session Summary ★
To improve reliability, performance and maintainability, LEG is moving all of its labs (DevCloud, MLab, HPC, etc) out of the Cambridge office into a professional data centre. 

In this presentation we show what problems we had and how the new lab will solve them.

This pattern will be reproduced in other data centres around the world, in partnership with our members, to develop new best practices for Arm enterprise deployments.
