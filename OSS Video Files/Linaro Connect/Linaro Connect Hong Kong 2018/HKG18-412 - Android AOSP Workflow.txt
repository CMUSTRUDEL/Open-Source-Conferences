you

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,660
so this talk it's gonna work

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,599
there actually between AOSP and their

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,460
workflows sort of basically tries to

00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,960
answer a number of questions that I've

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:33,110
been given last year so kind of need

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,239
some diagrams to describe so first of

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,220
all I really don't have any internal

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:41,300
knowledge on how this really works it's

00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,739
second hand rumors but the diagrams in

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,680
this presentation are really simple

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:47,120
models help people understand how it

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,839
works for house attitude

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,489
I'm sure books clarify love or

00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:54,940
complexity so this is very much like the

00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,940
Thomson's model

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,970
you understand club mechanics it's just

00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:04,129
kind of help you understand phases it's

00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:09,229
up here at the top of the screen we're

00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:11,390
going to be focusing on internal anger

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:15,800
of your posts of people these are all

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:19,340
great product focus every year and then

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:23,960
down at the bottom of a community focus

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,570
three votes that are public so here's

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,780
kind of the basic diagram we have down

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,810
here

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,649
the AOSP master branch this is basically

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:36,210
the trunk of the tree open year round

00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:41,000
it's public external development

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:44,040
in taxes to Garrett we have cases where

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,870
external contributors or external

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,170
developers even have commit access in

00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:52,320
some cases and then basically once a

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,300
year or I guess I give it a year who

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,050
will break off and start doing their

00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,610
private development expander and they do

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,080
all that you know Stephen internal

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:08,009
development finally gets stable enough

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,700
tagging for police it's more tenuous be

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,470
mastered

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,780
what about we will be done and then that

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,970
will get merged the bastard and then

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,140
basically the whole cycle will repeat

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:21,150
again for another release now there are

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,010
a couple of cases where there teams who

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:31,980
do they're going directly against this

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,270
tree and then the tree this does it

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,800
requires a fair amount that should work

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,570
on their parts we really love these

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,650
teams it's great to kind of follow along

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,180
externally but they're rare so this is

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,450
sort of the standard model where people

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,450
or not

00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:52,750
that always master and there are some

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,460
cases where you'll see changes from the

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,830
internal trees come out to beoh stream

00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,900
master deviously will disappoint the two

00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,160
branches to diverge too badly so

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,960
sometimes some of the things are working

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,030
on they want to get that push back into

00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,610
a okay master but for the most part it's

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,610
until the tack is where we don't see a

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,240
bunch of those changes so sort of the

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,980
first issue I'd like to kind of cover

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,980
causes a lot of confusion release tags

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:29,860
so last year as an example we had early

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,680
in the year Google kind of forked off

00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:38,610
the SP it started their own developer

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:43,660
tree and they did all that then in April

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:45,820
we did we finally got 160 support merged

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,100
into a low speed it's a lots of

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,140
excitement lots of you know Pierre and

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,970
what I really went out to kind of notice

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,250
that it's very exciting people box for

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,550
words to rock that's forward a couple

00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,400
months later I guess

00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:04,300
August September the Oreo release came

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,620
off the tires are paid to master this is

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,980
really excited about this people jump

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,280
out they check out their Android you

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,270
know release and then they start to

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,190
build it for their high keyboard to

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,610
realize it is not actually any support

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,519
it's not a Ledge target and part of the

00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,849
reason

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,580
you know the tags are made on the

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:27,349
internal branch and then pushed it so if

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,449
you basically pull those keymaster here

00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:35,270
you can get the murder of Gertrude and

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:38,210
almond on there it's about 60 but just

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,530
at least the no.10 didn't and so this

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,330
was very surprising and lots of people

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,250
were asking questions about this and so

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,530
basically the work that goes along my

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,169
name is key master while that private

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:51,289
dog is really gonna show up in the next

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,550
release you know in this case the IQ 960

00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:55,069
was calling because when they did they

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,599
point one tree they have been called up

00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:00,229
further they was keymaster to do that

00:04:56,599 --> 00:05:01,460
tree but you know when folks are going

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,720
to go in against a tree that's where we

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,909
do have to kind of think that this is

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,909
potentially work that is a year ahead

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,580
so the next type of issue of diffusion

00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:17,539
that we see is a dumb question

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,629
sure what do you remember gap length of

00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:23,310
time between

00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:23,310
support merged and the like

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:43,919
I feel like this was and then you know

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:46,080
they wouldn't do it show them there but

00:05:43,919 --> 00:06:00,180
it was a fairly good gather time there

00:05:46,080 --> 00:06:02,250
oh yeah there so the that there's an

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,740
aspect to some of the released tags that

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,419
sometimes they have this is again this

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,629
is the internal complexities the quantum

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:13,729
mechanics of it they have multiple

00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:17,189
branches per device and so in some cases

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:19,110
when they release a tag the tag is for

00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,550
specific devices see some features show

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,589
up in one tag or disappear in the next

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,449
tag and show up again and whichever one

00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,729
is ready I obviously this is where they

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,830
don't have definite answer questions

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:35,520
there but that that's a very good

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:37,080
flexibility so yes so on depth we're

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,339
testing just go the next aspect is

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,830
disgusting so very ASP master this is

00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,920
all available publicly so Vanara can't

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,510
do regular you know

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,430
and testing against it and so we're

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,900
doing that kind of all the time making

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,750
builds going on when we do fairly

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,830
regular testing but things to break you

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,290
know sometimes the changes that are

00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,940
being made but some of those changes

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:03,950
that are getting pulled down from the

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:05,120
tree will cost something break and you

00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,860
know hopefully we were able to kind of

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,200
quickly catch it and fix it up fairly

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:14,180
fast but it does have a probably more

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:17,300
often in the chart here shows up now no

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,250
internal trees basically you know

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,020
they're focused on the phone's dead

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,180
points there so it's one of those things

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,410
where you know

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,020
Dmitry's a kind of soul that he goes off

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,060
and occasionally takes some time to test

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,150
their internal branches against the hi

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,410
keyboard and you know sometimes it works

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,460
sometimes it doesn't

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:39,050
but it doesn't go begging to see who's

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,850
who might you know what the progression

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,820
was maybe if we can get that fixed if

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,280
that makes sense

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:49,520
sometimes that stuff can be done quite

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,380
often when those tags are made it's not

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,640
really working well on the networks and

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,970
that's just because internally there's

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,360
not a lot of testing just because their

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,710
product focused this had kind of a

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,150
secondary side effect if when those

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,800
changes landed today was remastered

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,240
there's about a week of chaos where

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,000
we're trying to fix the assignment it's

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,880
go again and this is kind of rough

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,470
because I mean you know folks who hear

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,420
about the release and about the police

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,090
they want to go grab those tags and even

00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,920
japanese puts a ton of work in the LCR

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,720
bills which start with these tags and

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,110
then he tries to back for all these

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,330
fixes that we make here or even pull

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,290
fixes the kingdom through here up into

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:33,920
that tree to make those go but it's a

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:36,070
lot of work and meanwhile down here not

00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,720
really sure if we're gonna run to need

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,540
trouble spots so it's sort of the

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,370
situation that I don't know people dog

00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,250
owners are not you have the sort of

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,310
aspect of you know the trustworthy and

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:53,590
reliable incontinence of the dog versus

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,880
the chaos and craziness of puppies and

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,500
really I think that's one of those

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,370
things where you kind of on it something

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,800
kind of in between so one of the things

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,390
we've been working on disparities to try

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,710
to help here is this idea of no good

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:12,740
manifest so it's like that we do again

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:16,370
daily bills are just part of you know

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,470
good hygiene create these pin manifests

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,060
and this allows folks to recreate the

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:25,220
builds of an adult eternally and

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,490
separately from that I usually do you

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,690
know hands-on testing on the wards

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,130
saying build everything make sure

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,300
everything's really working well you

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,860
know try to taste a few buckets of

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,150
dinner and to some extent we're trying

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,590
to combine these two efforts so

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,570
basically now so the meet just doing a

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,580
repo sync and testing what I have on my

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,440
tree I can make use of the magnet bills

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,870
which have these pin manifests that

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,520
allow others to produce them and I can

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,870
basically run through my tests make sure

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,310
everything's looking good there's no

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,319
performance issues

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,749
very obvious and then I can kind of say

00:09:54,319 --> 00:10:02,060
okay this is good bless that manifest as

00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:04,550
big and hopefully with this kind of

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,290
allows folks to do more ASP master

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,790
development but kind of a loyalty

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:12,709
stability pitfalls that we sometimes see

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,139
if you want to find this this is a hub

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,660
here that is exploited they were

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:20,410
speaking husks there's some instructions

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,399
on how to use the manifest to swap back

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,720
ideally you don't want to be running the

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,069
manifest forever so we've swapped me

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,410
back to a misty master's fairly easy

00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:33,769
with them then as far as things that I

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:37,519
hope to evolve it's been somewhat new we

00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:39,110
had two weeks of conferences here at the

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,759
last moment manifest is a little stale

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,970
this point I hope to have a weekly

00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:46,220
update for the case there but what I'm

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,069
excited about is that in the past when I

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,720
was doing my development I'm doing this

00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:52,490
testing along with kind of keeping my

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,680
develop the trees up to date with the

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,509
latest dates from master and so I often

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,240
run into the case where I do a repo sync

00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:00,920
and end up with a broken middle or

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,990
something just long and then I'm sort of

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,690
stuck because there was no easy way to

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,460
and

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,650
you can track of that and so like this

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,110
we now have a real easy way to kind of

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,880
get back to a good point but we also

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,610
have kind of two manifests that they

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,930
have this reboot diff Manifesta tool and

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,070
this little-ass kind of to narrow down

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,650
islands we need to start doing things

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:24,260
like mice acting to help find out what

00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,610
caused the regression a lot faster so

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,170
I'm excited about this and trying to

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,890
figure out how to introduce in tooling

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,090
to improve that ability to bisect down

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:35,030
some other aspects is that since we do

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,860
these daily builds that's done a lot

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,560
Ravel kft work so their greatest

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,820
validation on those builds but it would

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:47,540
be nice to be able to kind of pull it

00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:48,890
those signals into and then kind of a

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,110
further stretch goal there would be

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,480
maybe we can extend up aft a little bit

00:11:51,110 --> 00:12:03,140
we might be able to do some of the

00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:07,060
manual HDMI peripheral I'm a little

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,060
skeptical because I feel like a lot of

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,550
its

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,550
other ideas

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:26,770
so the last thing I want to cover so

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,330
they got straight about a girl community

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,330
we have this concept of average window

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,700
basically after police intimated there's

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,920
a two-week window where new features and

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,990
functionality to be added after that two

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,820
weeks then between the closes and for

00:12:40,990 --> 00:13:01,810
the next six to eight weeks

00:12:42,820 --> 00:13:05,460
its functionality in any time but we've

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:12,660
run into a couple of cases where develop

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:16,390
you know fairly large substantial change

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,790
and they spent a number of months

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,670
developing and polished to get ready to

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,260
submit upstream and they get it upstream

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,790
and we start getting folks trying to get

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:30,940
used to review it and see if it can be

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:32,830
merged not this year that can be kind of

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,870
devastating if you spent all this time

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,470
on it might get six to nine months

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,800
before they looked at and so it just

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,600
sucks that there is a emergent deal or

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,890
more complicated changes there's times

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,050
where maybe it's a little easier for

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,960
Android developers to be able to have

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,470
some time

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,170
things that are fairly complicated work

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:59,390
that maybe they want their eternal bills

00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:01,070
to damage too much from master seems to

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,560
be kind of shortly after these tags are

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:10,390
made and before the great job for the

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:13,100
next to the northern hemisphere decide

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:16,270
that's up she's there but it does sort

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:23,330
of follow I would guess probably

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:25,520
traditionally early fall but yeah so

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,170
that's just something I wanted to will

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:32,510
be aware of the tread figure out you

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:33,890
know how many dresses I guess I'm

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,589
thinking about it's just kind of has a

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,000
community kitchen window concept be make

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,470
it a little more wiser if he's

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,790
documented in some way because I think

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,649
it is one of those things there's a time

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,660
and the other developers do you know

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,800
they can't really South they can go on a

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,100
vacation they've got a little bit of

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,150
time to think that's sort of the time

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,640
having more complicated things

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,380
see here so I just want to make sure the

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,260
other developers don't get surprised to

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,930
the way we have in sometimes as far as

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:07,320
mother is we might as community be able

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:08,790
to know what what your own input on this

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,950
as well but just I'm trying to think of

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,620
things like ways improving just general

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,820
stability Tomatoes a master if there's

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,339
some way that we have tomorrow maybe

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,350
could do something like you know watch

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,960
Garrett as you convinced you up tried to

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,610
do some pre submit testing for Lords

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,200
basically so similar to what Google

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:30,000
already does what 300 but maybe more

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,779
point specific testing that's just

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,339
something to kind of start thinking

00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,500
about this first we might be able to do

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,580
that now that sort of ideas it's kind of

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,589
nearly can we find what is to get more

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,560
participation into something as master

00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:46,100
and people

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,420
tip of the tree because you know as long

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,170
as all the vendors are kind of focused

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:54,050
on their just the stable leases AOSP

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:58,430
master I guess doesn't amount of

00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:01,689
collaboration and shared testing I think

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,689
that we kind of

00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:29,250
more recognizes that there's a real

00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:33,000
tendency the people consuming to be

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:35,610
almighty 962 what to take April 1/3 next

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,620
April reasons did mentioned they had be

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,780
merged in but it was not in a state to

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,910
when they emerged into have xox practice

00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,910
so I would want is still not

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,220
that's yeah that's where y'all put it's

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,430
done a lot of her to try to do that but

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:57,540
that's often LCR and that's not really

00:16:52,430 --> 00:17:00,480
yes it is tough though yeah I mean AOSP

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:09,390
master is the only branch that is really

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:10,589
supportive yeah okay this is the branch

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,550
that supported will have service

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:17,850
snapshots on that bridge basically and

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:22,950
to some definition of it's one of those

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:26,810
things where I can't promise at least be

00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,810
really obvious terrible stuff

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:38,210
currently the the primary communication

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:44,070
channel or intentions will get it so

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:46,110
submit a patch review so our thinking if

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,870
there any chance you can get something

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,149
like curved if ever two people can have

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,679
the mail let stand poised about ten of

00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:55,919
these components are also people can

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,309
chocolate in and works we constantly

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,200
have them new idea for economy movement

00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:04,260
we can't have so instead of waiting for

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,399
like several months for a big release

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,470
and also endured copies open-source but

00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:12,330
to some extent it's very different from

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,029
the way currently Peloponnese open

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:17,700
sourced lots of things here keep behind

00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,990
the doors and here there's a formal

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,870
release and awesome until we know

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:25,110
exactly what next few years so I'm not

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,960
sure how these things can be done more

00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,450
better openly

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,700
communication generation so previous

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,260
years we've had similar discussions and

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,390
I know that you know the Google

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,950
developers they're always like I feel

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,200
like their intent is to try to make it

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,640
so that people can submit to books when

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,410
stuff goes up and if something's you

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,520
know sitting there for a long time make

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,350
sure you let them know because they

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,370
really don't intend to be you know

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,960
neglecting submissions one of the things

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,960
that we've talked about a lot inside of

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,410
our ways is trying to build up a sense

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,300
of not maintainer but commentators or

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,980
the idea of like you know having folks

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,660
who are introducing the specific topics

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:08,630
and you can go in and do additional

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:10,790
review and try to help get close to

00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,590
crunch time on a product like the amount

00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:16,940
of free time they have to go review

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,050
whatever crazy idea and so it's one of

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,580
those things we've been we've talked

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,170
about I think it would be a good idea

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,670
I think it is still hard because we and

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,220
all of us have our own things to do and

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,570
even just across all of open-source I

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,210
think there's kind of a maintainer

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:32,500
deficit and we don't really have a great

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,500
way to manage

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,679
the description at least for people in

00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:24,309
the narrow account circumstance again

00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:26,529
welcome SP to what it does there was

00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:28,450
some discussion like that what we

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:31,480
encourage you to welcome War II the

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,159
universe because that you can more
