I'm gonna turn it over to the best known

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:17,340
mark in the room please join me in

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:26,310
welcoming mark Hamilton this is the

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:29,099
design of the t-shirt so it says on the

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,929
notes introduce yourself I figured

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,000
that's probably a good start my name is

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,079
Mark Hamilton I lead the open source

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,730
software group in central engineering

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,430
I've been doing it for about three three

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,079
and a half years and I always assumed

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,090
when I do these things that most people

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:51,899
might sort of know me but I figure I'll

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:53,579
just say hello good morning so today I'd

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,149
like you'd like to introduce you to a

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,090
new trend that we're seeing describe the

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,309
what and the why and some key attributes

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,510
but also explain why I think it's

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,760
important to all of us

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,409
and hopefully you'll start to understand

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,210
why I'm getting quite excited about it

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,770
and why I've been talking about it in

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:19,170
many of the steering committees what am

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:23,189
I going to talk about Fogg 20 years ago

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,990
I did a startup that got a good reaction

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:30,990
from at least cancer that's actually

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,850
taken from a TV show that two of us in

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,640
this room hopefully Ryan managed to make

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,229
it in this morning oh there we go I'm

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,579
expecting Ryan to go to sleep in three

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:45,630
slides but 20 years ago I actually did a

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,470
startup that's actually the team now we

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,450
we started working on moving core

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,119
network services to the edge as part of

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,159
the broadband revolution it was becoming

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,740
clear that the sort of things that we

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,320
were trying to do with our internet

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,610
connectivity weren't going to scale as

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,040
we could we were connecting more and

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,299
more devices and yes it was 20 years ago

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,520
we were talking about one and a half

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,520
megabits per second at best

00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,310
this is actually an example of an edge

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:19,100
compute system it's the the 19-inch rack

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:23,090
thing in the corner yes I am running Red

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:31,580
Hat on the on the displays I've since

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:34,010
moved to a bun - sorry John now we've

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,050
done the smartphone revolution we've

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,960
nagged we're now securely backing up our

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:42,140
photos or contacts everything about our

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,690
lives into the cloud we can now

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,050
reinstall everything at the flick of a

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,310
flick of a touchscreen

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,709
we've better connected than we've ever

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,310
been through these through these

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:57,620
seminars and we're kind of doing the IOT

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,810
revolution now where we're collecting

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:05,900
sensors and actuators - cloud services

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,550
and then use a portal in the cloud to

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:15,790
control and monitor things about our

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:18,140
lives but IOT is getting more complex

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,300
these are some of the things that you

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,120
could describe as an IOT device if you

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,670
think about it so I've got a connected

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,769
car looks like George has got a

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,230
connected car because he was showing us

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,580
the the output from his - when he was

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,790
looking at the versions of his kernel

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,010
yesterday but when we start connecting

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,380
drones when we started connecting all of

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,900
the elements of a smart city wind farms

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,239
electricity generation etc etc you're

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,640
starting to talk about thousands of

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,610
devices connecting to connecting to the

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,650
internet but actually a lot of these

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,930
devices a lot of these these collections

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,260
of devices from smart city smart home

00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:01,610
smart factories share a lot of the

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:04,850
attributes of the autonomous vehicles so

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,790
when we think about a smart anything it

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:10,760
will most likely post multiple sensors

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,160
of different types control actuators of

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,709
different types connect to multiple

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,370
cloud services services for different

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:21,000
purposes require storage for local

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,430
content caching

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,210
and compute resources to do stuff with

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,950
that data so actually it's not really

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,300
that different what you think about when

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,300
you think about not wanna miss vehicle

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,430
so why isn't the endpoint to the cloud

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:46,680
necessarily the right answer

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:50,070
well think of the smart light bulb it's

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,990
great when everything's working but this

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,550
is an example from Facebook I got from

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,190
one of my friends back in this Indian

00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:00,380
days there you go I got to say Symbian

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,380
on stage again another llanera connect

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,590
basically the system that he was using

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,900
defaulted to one when the power went out

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,150
and then came back up no internet

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:16,010
connectivity basically all of the lights

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,390
in his house came on full full blast I

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,040
believe he also removed all of the light

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:25,860
switches why do you need them when

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:28,650
you've got a smart home but imagine that

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,810
happening in your autonomous vehicle if

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,150
it was completely reliant on cloud

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,479
services to give it its its indications

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,610
of what to do it's not gonna work is it

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,030
so you need to start thinking about how

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:46,020
you push more and more processing and

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,950
intelligence towards the edge but also

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,770
when you think about things like

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,600
autonomous vehicles think about the

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,380
connectivity challenges that you have on

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,000
a day to day basis I live on the

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,419
outskirts of London 12 miles from

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,830
Heathrow and I regularly go to Heathrow

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:08,130
as we probably know I can't actually

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,500
have a phone call in the car as it takes

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:14,040
me to Heathrow the foot the phone will

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,600
drop at least twice that's obviously not

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,240
acceptable when you've got a complex

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,240
machine trying to do something

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,240
and so when you think about it the

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,370
number of devices that we're connecting

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,700
to these cloud services is increasing

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,530
exponentially the data requirements of

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,130
those cloud services is increasing

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:41,010
exponentially latency is critical to a

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,030
lot of the things that we're doing too

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:47,400
many of these new applications and that

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,610
doesn't scale even with all of the new

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,090
connectivity technologies so something's

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,090
got to change

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,100
so the trend I'm talking about is

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,300
pushing data center services to the edge

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,100
which we referred to as either edge

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:08,400
computing or Kyle or the fog we're

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,990
building compute storage connectivity

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,750
control and decision-making into these

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,760
clusters of devices much closer to the

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:23,400
edge in between the cloud and the local

00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:28,320
network to enable local processing and

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,540
decisions for latency sensitive services

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:35,250
when that cloud connection is not always

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:37,590
available obviously the light is a very

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,320
simple use case and you can solve that

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,870
in many different ways just by putting a

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,570
light switch in but think about some of

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,340
the other things that we're building

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:50,160
into this modern connected world and you

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,220
start to realize that something needs to

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,220
change

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,540
so what do we mean in reality well you

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,610
can't always assume physical security

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,460
right in the data center there's

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,620
generally an access control cage and you

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,670
don't need to do quite as many things as

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,370
you would need to do on the modern-day

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,200
smartphone so you think about the

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,030
modern-day smartphone it's probably got

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,470
a lot of the security attributes a lot

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,100
of the update attributes that you need

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,710
for this kind of device but also it's

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,630
quite a controlled environment if you

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,490
then think of the sort of data center

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,640
services that you need to build into

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,130
these modern edge services you're

00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:36,420
merging the data center and mobile

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:38,580
compute but then you add in safety

00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,060
critical systems and you basically have

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:46,170
a data center on wheels with mobile data

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,030
with mobile security it means that we're

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,340
merging technologies from multiple

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,350
segments we're adding safety critical

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:56,270
requirement safety critical system

00:08:52,350 --> 00:09:00,350
requirements along with mobile

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,350
communication technology mobile security

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,110
sounds like fun

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,420
it sounds like the sort of thing that

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,900
kind of challenge that we'd like to to

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,900
take out

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:19,980
so really the move to fog is about

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,530
latency security privacy and autonomy

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,680
when things go down the picture says it

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,680
all

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,890
but it also means that device creators

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,200
it does feel a bit weird calling a car a

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,690
device but I'm gonna go with it right

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,560
because I do think of them all the same

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:45,310
these days but device creators can pick

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,110
the right size compute storage

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:51,770
connectivity for the thing that they're

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,120
building which means that anything to do

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,720
with the fog has to be multi

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,180
architecture from the outset right no

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,640
one architecture no one vendor is going

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:06,260
to win the fog space well that at least

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,180
that's my prediction but it's also going

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,709
to be truly open and scalable because

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,290
you're going to be moving services from

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,300
inside the data center much much closer

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,800
to the edge running it on hardware

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:21,230
that's not necessarily owned by the

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:23,930
service vendor so that means adopting

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,500
standards for software for platforms

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,490
that we probably don't know about yet

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:36,940
Charles are smiling because that means

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:38,930
he's in the job for life so hopefully

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,940
people have already been looking around

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,200
at this but if not I'll do a little bit

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:47,270
to introduce the open fog consortium

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,290
this was founded back in November 2015

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:54,080
and as you can see among others Intel an

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,390
arm were founding members that means

00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,790
open fog is multi architecture right

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,459
from the beginning now I'm not saying

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,890
this is the only consortium that's

00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:05,540
defining the fog there are many

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,029
standards bodies that are looking at

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,930
this sort of thing right this is just an

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:13,970
example but it is really encouraging

00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,779
that right from the beginning we've got

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:22,000
multiple architectures involved in in

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,000
defining the solutions to this problem

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,160
now the open consortium has defined

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:35,589
a reference architecture which contains

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,589
its eight pillars of standardization

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,760
it's a unified home framework to help

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,029
software developers land their

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,140
technology on these platforms to develop

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:52,550
compute network storage control

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,070
accelerators communications

00:11:52,550 --> 00:12:05,540
I think networking communications are

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:07,730
the same thing don't read the notes in a

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,800
in an open way so that you can move

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,100
services between between each of these

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,130
devices so interoperability is very key

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,339
here but it also creates a common

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,410
language for us to discuss the different

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:26,750
attributes that we expect from a fault

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:31,959
node so I'm going to look at a couple of

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:35,089
these pillars always start with security

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:40,430
none of this makes sense if you don't

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:45,860
have a security platform that you can

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:48,260
trust there are going to be gazillions

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,839
of these things out in the field so one

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:56,020
of the basic tenets of security is

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:59,440
update ability and being up-to-date

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,850
Jorge mentioned this yesterday right

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,589
this very little point in saying that

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,920
you're secure if you're running software

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:09,589
that's ten years old on devices that are

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:14,089
trying to talk to other other security

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:16,820
critical devices it means we need a

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:20,029
standard up tool and standardized update

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,740
mechanism right we've got to be able to

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:25,640
update every single piece of software

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:29,930
running on those devices but it also

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,790
means elongated maintenance periods for

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,220
each of these devices I've been saying

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,260
this for a while expect maintenance to

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:41,010
get

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,340
imagine buying a car that within four

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,780
years goes out of its maintenance period

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,480
no longer receiving updates with

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,390
security flaws in it that's not gonna

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,670
work consumers aren't going to do it

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:56,340
so smartphones you see those getting

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,930
updates for know four or five years it's

00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,000
going to be much worse the more complex

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:04,680
these systems become and let's face it

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,780
service providers aren't going to be

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:12,180
deploying services to devices that they

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:15,630
cannot trust so one of the key

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,670
attributes of security is trust and one

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:22,230
of the key attributes of trust to me is

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:24,750
identity you need to know what the

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:28,530
device is that you're running on and be

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,940
sure that it is actually that device but

00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,730
in the fog there will be multiple

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,220
devices talking to each other

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,990
imagine the car in front is able to give

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,710
you information about what's going on on

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,270
the road if your car can't trust that it

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,430
is actually what it says it is and where

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:49,050
it says it is you can't make use of the

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:50,940
data you have to discard it so there's

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,370
going to be a focus on actually defining

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,240
what identity means and what trust means

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,240
over the next few years

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:08,670
one of the big upsides of more local

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:10,860
processing for me is privacy I really do

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,460
understand the convenience of these

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,500
online services these cloud services I

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:21,060
post on Facebook I use all of the backup

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,100
services I get with my smartphone but I

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,980
would also like to choose which services

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,380
I opt into and what data is shared about

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,380
me I've got a connected car

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,470
I was recently quite surprised what the

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,020
dealership knew about my driving style

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,790
before had handed them the keys they

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,860
also knew exactly where the car had been

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,520
and could tell me what speed I was going

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:51,120
on my journey and I don't remember

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:53,220
signing anything so I don't think the

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,720
balance is quite right at the moment I'd

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,420
still like access to all that

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,510
information I'd like to understand what

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,270
the car what the car knows about me and

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,950
whether I might use the accelerator a

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,570
little bit too much and maybe I hit the

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,810
brakes a little bit too hard that's all

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:16,800
very useful I'm not sure anybody else

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:21,990
needs to know so I think privacy also

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,940
gives you a great sorry move to fog also

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,580
gives you a great opportunity to get

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,720
some of our privacy back some of the IOT

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,910
offerings that we've got at the moment

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,430
are collecting wonderful amounts of data

00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,500
about our lives but it's not necessarily

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,610
held close enough to where that data is

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,610
generated for my liking

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:49,430
now decentralized processing and control

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,750
can enable multiple local nodes to

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,510
handle the workload that you would

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,810
expect to be handled in the data center

00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:58,730
so if you can use multiple Fog nodes

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,980
within the network to do the processing

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,529
of the data center they need to have

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,949
there needs to be a very open set of

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:08,689
communication between the two so open

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:13,040
and scalability of very important

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:15,319
pillars for me it means the relationship

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,140
between the nodes obviously must be

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:21,730
underpinned by trust and security so

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,730
most of these pillars are interconnected

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,690
and then when you bring it all back

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,029
together you can see that they're

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,190
defining a pretty comprehensive baseline

00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:44,460
for what you'd assume is required for

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:46,850
this emerging trend so let's take a look

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,850
at some examples

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:57,630
video surveillance so when you think of

00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:01,830
the amount of data being generated by HD

00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:03,990
cameras streaming all of that data so a

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,880
cloud service is not going to be cost

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,010
effective and there probably isn't

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:13,289
enough bandwidth in the world to be able

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:15,360
to do that on a city scale so processing

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:18,029
in the fog enables you to make local

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,090
decisions about which data needs to be

00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:23,610
stored into the cloud you can do smart

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,250
things like you know image detection

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,230
pattern detection using local processing

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,919
nodes before you need to move any data

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:34,590
up into the cloud so they can

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,880
intelligently partition local processing

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,880
and cloud storage

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:50,309
but also imagine drones being controlled

00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:52,830
by a central control office it's not

00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,690
going to scale you've got a lot of

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,409
latency in there when trying to control

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,539
tricky things like takeoff landing

00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:02,399
loading and unloading although I quite

00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:08,039
like the idea of parachutes and just

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:11,149
drop this stuff so you you can support

00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:14,039
autonomous awareness and very very

00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:15,720
fine-grain control just by moving the

00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:22,489
processing closer to where the drones

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:24,659
are actually operating I couldn't really

00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:27,859
address this audience without putting

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,859
something up about beer-making

00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:35,789
manufacturing so any factory there are

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,519
going to be industrial secrets being

00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:40,349
exposed by the IOT devices that are

00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,279
monitoring you know all of the

00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:48,590
attributes of that manufacturing plant

00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,590
one example here is craft beer making

00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:55,149
I thought the audience had been a bit

00:19:51,999 --> 00:20:01,690
too quiet that's obviously the fog from

00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:03,460
last night so the fog can enable lots of

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,679
systems that have been installed over

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:10,509
the over many years to be connected up

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,489
and monitored by local servers you don't

00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:15,730
necessarily necessarily need to upgrade

00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:19,629
the whole factory to give you the you

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,549
know the very real-time data on what's

00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:24,879
going on inside your your manufacturing

00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:27,279
plan but you can also use it to protect

00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:30,039
the data about what you're what you're

00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,539
generating do local encryption and do

00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,769
some kind of local processing to

00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:38,619
minimize the amount of data that you

00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:42,070
have to share that brings me on to a

00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:44,799
another example so I've been talking to

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:49,659
a company called swim for over a year

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:52,570
now I guess these guys have realized

00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:54,850
that to make smart cities for example

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,539
they work across multiple segments to

00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:01,779
make those those smart cities work it's

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:04,830
actually not cost-effective to connect

00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:09,039
every sensor directly into the cloud

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:13,359
the simple cost of transmitting all of

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:17,429
this data over telephony networks just

00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:21,549
makes it makes the cost prohibitive so

00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:27,090
they're using small scale processing

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:30,369
units to turn the data into stateful

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:32,619
transactions so that for example when

00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:34,450
traffic lights change or when traffic

00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:39,549
sensors detect that there are a queue of

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:41,499
vehicles they can use a local mesh to to

00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:44,440
actually indicate into the cloud service

00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:46,960
that you know that estate has changed so

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,210
turning this this gray sensor data where

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,139
you don't really understand what it is

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,169
locally into something that's meaningful

00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:57,399
to the service that's being that's being

00:21:53,169 --> 00:22:01,710
provided and that's all based on fog

00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,710
technology and it's being deployed now

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:13,480
so there's always they're always ship

00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:16,659
yes so what slide in anything moving

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,909
services closer to the edge means that

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:22,119
we're going to be distributing compute

00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:24,639
rather than necessarily concentrating in

00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:27,369
the data center the computers going to

00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:30,039
be anywhere you can imagine on your

00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:32,919
network it means two different shapes

00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,049
and sizes the reason why I'm interested

00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,419
in that is that's what the arm

00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:39,609
partnership does we make computer

00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,399
different shapes and sizes different

00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:44,109
power levels you know it's it's

00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:48,850
bewildering that they're kind of form

00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:52,840
factors that we that we work on it also

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:55,840
implies more security we've got the

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,359
mobile security model we're molding it

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,739
with the data center model we need to

00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:02,019
bring these two things together and

00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:04,649
define what that actually means to give

00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:08,080
us the right level of trust and identity

00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:10,989
and it means interoperability on a scale

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,919
that we've never seen before so that

00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:17,049
means new runtimes new communications

00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:18,489
protocols potentially or just making

00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:24,580
sure that the ones that we've got are

00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:28,389
actually fit for purpose and secure it

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,919
also means new levels of trust if

00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:32,320
service providers are going to start

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,139
moving cloud services onto pieces of

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,519
hardware that they don't actually own

00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:40,659
that's another level of trust that we've

00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:45,389
not seen standards are going to be

00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:47,679
really key to this security is key I

00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:49,359
believe having really good upstream

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,429
support for the hardware is going to be

00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,619
key because you're going to need to be

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:57,580
constantly updating the devices that are

00:23:53,619 --> 00:24:01,080
running within the fog I think that's

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,080
what George said yesterday as well

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,280
to me fog brings together the best of

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,320
all of the segments and all of the

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,780
challenges of all of the segments right

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:18,190
it's not all upside some of the problems

00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:19,419
that we need to solve for the probably

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,059
one of the hardest problems like the

00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:25,510
autonomous vehicle are going to be hard

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:31,030
but once we get there the possibilities

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:33,220
are endless it requires us to work

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,860
together to make sure those data center

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,710
technologies can be delivered on top of

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:43,780
things like mobile security and

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:46,720
automotive safety criticality it means

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,000
working together on standards not trying

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:54,400
to give you more work Charles but is

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,520
what it is and standards that work on

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:04,270
any hardware topology any architecture

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:06,909
it's got to be truly inclusive I thought

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,559
I put Allen ro slide in here because

00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,850
let's face it a lot of the players that

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,669
are going to be working on folk

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:16,809
technology are already on the left-hand

00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:20,039
side and actually quite a few of the

00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:22,450
components that are going to be

00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:26,710
important for technology already on the

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:29,650
right-hand side what we now need to

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,690
start thinking about is how we merge

00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,360
some of these components how we how we

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:37,919
build on top of them to deliver the next

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,919
the next Fogg experience

00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:45,669
I couldn't do one of these without

00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:51,789
putting the the robot picture right it's

00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:54,219
like my pot of M&Ms this is my call to

00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:56,710
action what I'd like to see is that we

00:25:54,219 --> 00:26:00,340
all get engaged on what the next

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:02,590
disruption is I really believe that

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:06,219
systems of connected embedded devices

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:08,049
are the next big disruption right we've

00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:09,729
been through many waves of this this is

00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:11,639
the next one that I think is going to

00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:14,619
hit us

00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:17,830
so please think about edge computing

00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:20,559
folk computing and where you fit in I've

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,690
raised this at the TSC you've probably

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,129
seen some of the some of the

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,210
conversations that George and David have

00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:29,799
been having I want to see how us as Alan

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,479
our membership and the wider arm

00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,479
partnership play in this new space

00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:39,099
covers everything as far as I can tell

00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:42,580
this is the new thing that everybody

00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:45,920
will be talking about and thankfully

00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:50,469
that's it for me

00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,469
[Applause]

00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:00,450
okay thanks mark here we go

00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:03,200
and he didn't break a leg all right so

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,200
