Session Name: HKG18-108 - Deploying OPNFV on Arm with Compass4NFV
Speaker: Yibo Cai
Track: Enterprise


★ Session Summary ★
This session introduces deploying OPNFV on Arm with Compass4NFV project. OPNFV deployment is a complex and painful experience, and it's even worse on Arm. For Arm to be successful on OPNFV, we added Arm support to Compass4NFV, one of the official OPNFV installer. Now with Compass4NFV, we can easily deploy OPNFV infrastructure and scenarios on Arm servers. Includes: - Introducing OPNFV and Compass4NFV project - Adding Arm support to Compass4NFV - Deploying OPNFV on Arm

	00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,590
you

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,300
I mean should have introduced some of

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,000
our our experiments of deploying up

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,860
seeing at the unarmed platforms so a

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,860
more specific career I'm to introduce

00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:34,559
the compass for an FB project so use

00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:37,770
this tour token the young arm the agenda

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,410
first Adobe n feo builds and introduce

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,500
our experience share experiments of

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,570
deploying ophie ophie and then I would

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,570
reduce the contrast for Navy project

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,329
architecture focusing on bare metal

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,300
provision and the virtual purview then I

00:00:51,329 --> 00:01:00,329
produced the OPF is the ICD and the

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:03,059
testings also we were introduced our our

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:08,640
works to make compass for any of the

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:14,070
running smoothly on platforms first

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,900
about us so we we are armed C OSS teams

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,170
essential engineering open source

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,710
software will focus on open source

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,869
community enablement optimizations for

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:32,850
our platforms so focus on the enterprise

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:36,180
software such as an uber stack and big

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,509
data's networking that activity K all

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,600
these server level software's so this is

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,719
that a project that for OPM visas

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,170
project collaboration with networking

00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:52,020
and workloads teams so the the goriest

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,329
to develop containerized network Allah

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,280
so acceleration solutions and the

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,810
developer containerized the being F

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,210
solutions also we needed to ramelteon a

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,460
fee on our platforms and also we will

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,460
follow the community and best practices

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:15,040
so first our opening at the overview so

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:19,989
this is a very brief diagram of what

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:23,379
is omega P so trail PNP is a community

00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:25,769
is is a open-source software community

00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:28,230
so the purpose of OPM is the leverage

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:31,540
upstream open source software's

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,069
constructor referencing FB platform so

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:38,829
what it means is that OPA methey is self

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:41,980
doesn't have to say this is not focusing

00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:44,950
on developed but the horn solutions by

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,459
itself but it is an integration project

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,250
to integrate upstream open-source

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:55,329
projects to combine them and trigger

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,609
them and to make a deployable and a mean

00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,919
to enable the user to testing understand

00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:02,260
other any Fe platforms so the major

00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:07,299
components is integration deployment and

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,310
testing so for for this six slides and

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:15,280
focusing on a deployment and a testing

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:18,400
parts of Okemah P first time I want to

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,000
urge just to use some of our experiment

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,209
sister for deploying opieop e

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,040
unperformed

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,010
so this is kind of a frustrating

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,349
experience I have to say so first you

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,840
can see has three steps but at the very

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:35,530
beginning we are using few installer for

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,090
decoying OPM fees but a few installer

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,229
this is a very complicated software it

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,199
it has a beautiful you are

00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:46,180
II just can't avoid over complete

00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,329
assistance justified clicking your

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,849
mosque but the problem is that sometimes

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:56,349
it'll will fill but if the feels that

00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:57,970
you must have to develop or of the the

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:01,250
debugging of the field in storage very

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,440
hard especially on our platform because

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,720
fear is the first develop around the

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,060
executives for our platforms there are

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,430
many in three days and you needed to do

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,200
many harder debugging so this is a very

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,700
time-consuming also if something

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,430
something that happens you have to

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,620
redeploy the core system again muster

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,820
tear down the floor architecture and the

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,760
reading for again this is very

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,460
time-consuming

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,220
if I remember correctly the costs of six

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:35,540
hours to read the product texture of for

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,960
service this is right Azumi system soon

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,990
also fear is now discontinued by the

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,840
ranking system this is so this our first

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:50,180
step we said it works but it is not very

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,510
smooth sometimes it is a ping-pong

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:57,740
experience so second that we move to our

00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,650
own scripts based on as a publisher

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,140
scripts to to deploy the first of the

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,850
Provost text and above all listed we use

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:12,830
standard over static on projects like

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:17,000
ironic and other other projects to spawn

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:20,120
a kubernetes cluster about this so it

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,890
works and it's also because we designed

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,580
to by ourselves so it's easier to debug

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:29,180
and it works smoother but the problem is

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,860
this is not a is this is the under

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,160
visual solutions is a designer by

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:37,820
ourselves so it's not a G&P community

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,580
standard solutions so this is a big

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,240
problem so we cannot integrate our

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:49,000
installers our deployment processes with

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,000
the standard unity community

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:56,110
or some problem so we and we tended to

00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,840
our a certain such third approaches

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:02,880
I saw the tries we are using Jordans

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,460
order Jorah day is standard open heavy

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,320
installer so this is officially

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,990
supported it is developed by canonical

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,870
so it'll be in a backhand is to use

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,890
masks and a future or bare metal and a

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:24,070
playable Kunis deployment but the

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,320
problem is joyed only supports but when

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,350
I suppose you want to because it's a

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,770
canonical software so it's a talented

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:34,060
support centers or other districts so

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,070
this is the one probabilities not a

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,140
guest show neutral and the secular

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,190
program is due to talented supported

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:44,530
communities on arms so we want to

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:49,300
contribute a to jewel project but this

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:52,380
is not a very very smooth so so so they

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,479
say the sudden twice

00:06:52,380 --> 00:07:00,300
we didn't think it's a very successful

00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:05,590
trial so combining all these three

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:09,150
experience first either and we need an

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:12,520
official OPM big community of official

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,830
solutions and a study we did oversaw

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,110
such open source project so we can

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,110
contribute and we can and make it work

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:33,699
so nowadays we tend to our force force

00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:37,570
tries the compass for EMP we tend to

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:40,720
this project this is this is also a

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,400
community OPN FB community stand out the

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,979
booking fee installer such as an

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,860
official supporter installer so this is

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,490
a lightweight device that is also placed

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,490
on ansible

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,669
and the scripts so she has ripped so

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,580
there's a lot of easy guidance you need

00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:02,110
to the partners you can use just use

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:04,570
come on the lines check all the logs and

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,330
and everything is just that so it should

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:10,630
adhere if you found some parts they just

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:14,590
check the logs and take the details is

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:17,169
beautiful easy for newcomers so with the

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,240
talented support arm but the community

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:22,030
is it is where comes where comes the

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,789
contributors so we did much better

00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,199
billions through this to combat sport in

00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:30,849
a big project that were maybe the work

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:33,490
arms was and it's a sports post over

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:36,459
spec and the communities so we are

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,890
focusing on for for now we are focusing

00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:41,320
on communities difficulties there are on

00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,890
bare metal so this is a perfect fit for

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,630
our department also itself containerized

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,910
the deployment so the deployment and

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,310
procedure that

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,870
on the components of the drum post and

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,160
the runs around inside inside cocky

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,310
 I think until about the

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,410
environment so it's easy to meet him

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,600
also this edition neutral or so this is

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,090
very important so it apparently depend

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,380
on some districts you can deploy to

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:13,080
basically you can deploy any mainstream

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:17,840
Venus gift shops thus based on ansible

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:21,030
and this has flexible configurations so

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:25,260
last time I give an example of how to

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:27,180
quickly respond cookies clusters in

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,500
virtual machine just using one line of

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,840
code actually this is the one arm code

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,520
but evil runs it over costing more than

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,340
one hour to finish so here's the

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,240
catchment and lots of things this is a

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:44,610
deposit jealousy into deployment code

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:51,690
especially heavy tasks we can use just a

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:55,440
simple mantra no sir compass for lengthy

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:59,220
architectures you can see here this is

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:03,540
the major components of the come first

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,700
of all Navy jump postage on post at the

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,600
upper levels it's a composite deck is

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:13,080
container running the learning all the

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,750
API services so you can use modernized

00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,510
scripts or even the web UI just the

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,940
sooner rest apology I to connect to

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,690
controller for deployment processes and

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,210
as we inspect the results and in the

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,640
middle of that for middle levels middle

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:34,920
whereas reputable QE the message you

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:36,540
kill my sick database so this is store

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,650
some information

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,420
and process and this is the most - two

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,420
most important parts ability performance

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,990
so for every department actually there

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,820
are two components the first is the

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,800
ability from the bare metal operating

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,640
systems to be a metal so this is what a

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,960
compact corporate us it deploys the

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:02,280
Ubuntu or CentOS or other divinities

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:05,340
choose about a metro service and about

00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:09,180
this after operating system is running

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:13,050
can use compass tasks this is another as

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,570
abou based project it is easy to deploy

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:19,380
cognize a communities or deprive

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:23,580
openstep about this about the running OS

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:27,380
and about which we can develop our being

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,380
a virtual natural functions

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,210
there's a deployment procedure you can

00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:42,460
even know the left side a congested

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:44,770
check this one's so I just just lost a

00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:48,480
slightly compass Cobra and the compass

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:52,150
tasks to video components so for compass

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:58,030
table this is a Cobra Cobra upstream in

00:11:52,150 --> 00:12:02,560
exiting stolen so Cobra use this Cobra

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:05,290
as the core component so it imports the

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,900
Linux guests show ISO images inside and

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,030
so through that Hopa so it's running

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,180
inside I talk about it user host network

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,910
so it kind of says the network interface

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:21,030
cards out of the jump close the directly

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:25,830
to employ their operating systems use it

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:28,900
Society of Jesus consider standard

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:33,670
primitive ways and after this

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:36,430
also he wanted combat tasks committees

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:39,070
combat tasks so this is that based

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:42,810
around food esprit project for the spray

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:46,750
those community standard a standard

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:49,990
projector to wrong to deploy and around

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:53,110
the communities casters so this is the

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:58,510
deployment the prominent project for two

00:12:53,110 --> 00:13:03,420
minutes so this is the total steps

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:07,870
- wrong - kunst clusters from a bi-metal

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:12,270
service so all this already already

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,270
working on the r6 support freshman's

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:22,080
know if some ripping show how to deploy

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:25,120
a bare-metal de braga

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,100
better services this is visible to full

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,060
configuration parties you need needed to

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,220
container before the network files need

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,180
to configure before you deploy to

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,500
deployment

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,370
the first thing the hoster

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,040
configurations can see host adjust for

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,980
Lester a hosting commission system most

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,460
important is the holy of Grameen of

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,860
hosts

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,110
he used up a DMZ for excessive power

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,700
soon with BMC IP address username

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:59,350
password under the MAC address so that

00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:02,230
GPX me sir PFC services can match my MAC

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,630
address to give him appropriate IP

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,700
addresses so this is the distal hosting

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:12,940
from issues and so this is listed

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:15,310
networking for issues so for Napa focus

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,590
or at least a two networks are a part of

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,790
the management so this is the forest

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:25,000
origins the listed are share versus what

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:29,490
is also related projects is executing

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,790
eager to give him some dynamic addresses

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:37,750
fetch the installation images before the

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:41,980
of resistance and also it's not listed

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:46,300
here at the external yeses so the notes

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,760
also need a little extra no external

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,220
uses to access the internet so this is

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,230
the tool basic to a basic address is

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:58,630
required by a miss Custer

00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:04,740
is the choo-choo interface or has a

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,740
management this is the public

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:14,899
similarly trying to deploy our virtual

00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:17,009
machines so so the commas also surprise

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:20,689
supposed to pro version which this is

00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:24,149
the very very very easy for providers

00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:26,610
before you to actual physical primitive

00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:28,379
and first a try or every environment to

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,989
design a virtual environments so you

00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:34,079
could you just up all these virtual

00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:37,350
machines virtual of VMs and spoon

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,799
started jump host so we can use just the

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,230
one

00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:44,069
once the Alliance the one bare metal

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:48,179
server to experience the core deployment

00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:52,350
processes for virtual machines they also

00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:55,559
needed this requires a host account for

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,480
reaching the kind of is easier than and

00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,299
they are met with it but we didn't we

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,420
don't need at all it was a spider I

00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:06,929
chain a PMC informations for virtual

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,470
machines ever powers into the buyer

00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:12,329
perverse deliver but allergic amounts so

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:16,399
we don't need to exact for network

00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,399
introducing it's a similar similar

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:25,810
configurations now I will introduce

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,750
option VCR MST

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:32,440
so what we TFE I just said this is an

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,710
integration project so the continuous

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:40,750
integration and CD is a very important

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:43,270
folder for OPM big project so basically

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,870
the Committee of the community who

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,839
convene community provides the

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:52,540
infrastructure in this green green

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:56,680
classic room for boxes it provides a

00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:00,640
Chinese masters so - if you want to run

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,670
your own daily tasks or very fulfilling

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,600
classes needed to register seconds too

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,280
late to the the connector to the

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,730
required group connected to the

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:18,010
okey-dokey community so you can run your

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:22,059
own test cases in your own lever I'm

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:25,150
father this this is your own level this

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:27,760
is the interface selective order the

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,390
gentle sway vodcast John host connected

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,250
to the community

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:36,670
so you set up in your own projects or do

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:39,429
the jobs using the real amp project so

00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,070
we run projector setup jackets jobs

00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:44,490
Jerry Jones jobs is sugar divided Jake

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:49,059
his master's so the techno masters will

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:52,540
the indigenous Java so to specify which

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:55,720
node which name should run this specific

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:59,050
task so so all the tasks there instead

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:02,990
of running easily in your jackets in

00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:05,480
your own pop so this

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:09,399
and virtual machine or this can be bare

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:17,649
metal service you can just configure the

00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:17,649
pretzel bread yeah this is the ICD

00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:26,360
now I summarize some of our power what

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:30,480
what have we done so for compass

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,340
performs the criminal status is only

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,960
drove interests are already supported

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:40,919
among platforms we submit about twenty

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,039
across patches or ability to make a

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:47,460
compass or Nephi project to support up

00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:52,889
to can enhance the program there metal

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,240
service smoothly so for now Rhonda can

00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:57,029
pass called an inner zone

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,970
I'm John post so this means the

00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:02,580
Chancellor at happy and the peer mentor

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,309
who was deployment and akunis deployment

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:09,570
the country we supposed to be one point

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:14,029
seven goodness and also we can set up a

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:19,230
food Billy CI CD drops on Palmetto

00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:21,509
course so not a plan is first to support

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,450
a group needs to be 1.9 dose it's the

00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:26,879
latest version and also so supportive

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:30,450
Ryan you want offer we are now a list

00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:33,240
for Amtrak forgiven enable the samples

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:37,220
Esther know that option system we are

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,220
planning to support one faster

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:45,770
and also the refine our CD transfer to

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,660
be increased to Adamo tasks us committed

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:53,850
to live a more validation assemble at a

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:57,630
more provision tasks the community that

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:59,990
the tool is difficult more ground retail

00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,990
passes

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,630
okay so any problem and any questions

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,100
so this project is initialized by far

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:40,180
away and what is the the proper time we

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,070
can install this arms yes this is

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,580
project common spine physical issue by

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:49,870
Polly it's not okay it's not running on

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:52,120
arm so that the code are already merged

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,230
and the installation documents are

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,190
already merged you can just the

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,640
references as a

00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:00,100
arm-based operating document see this

00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,680
our student community upstream therefore

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,730
also use the upstream ripple we can we

00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:10,330
already can try this oh yeah yes so do

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:13,420
you have any recommended choices to

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:19,030
deploy this devices I have a server

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:22,410
which this is suddenly depend on arm so

00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,410
you can use just your

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,760
okay so this is kind of high levels of

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:32,139
presence in earth their activity just

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,929
that if we Ubuntu and or Sanders Kenya

00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:36,220
is kind of wrong on that set up

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:38,529
everything okay

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,309
so so the children must already can

00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:43,840
deploy it on our platform but is very is

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:46,330
strictly constrained with Ubuntu

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,060
distribution but with the business over

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:58,880
is this camp

00:21:49,060 --> 00:22:01,480
yessssss to do us another register to

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,220
two supports deploying all those parents

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:08,660
campuses already for the confirm cookies

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:12,350
arm is not forest pressure so we cannot

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:17,050
use the jutsu or to use the Jordans

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:17,050
order to intercept adversity product

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,550
