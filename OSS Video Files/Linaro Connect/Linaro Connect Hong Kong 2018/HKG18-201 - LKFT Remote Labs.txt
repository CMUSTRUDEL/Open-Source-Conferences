Session Name: HKG18-201 - LKFT Remote Labs
Speaker: Ryan Arnold
Track: Mobile


★ Session Summary ★
Linaro created the Linux Kernel Functional Test (LKFT) framework as a service capable of functional testing the Linux kernel under a full userspace image (e.g., OpenEmbedded and AOSP), on a variety of hardware and selectively reporting the results upstream (or to anyone who wants them) when regressions are detected. The purpose of this presentation is to describe Remote LKFT Labs which is a proposal to extend the reach of Linux kernel functional testing to Linaro member SoCs in a way that can accommodate privacy/confidentiality concerns of members as well as address device complexity concerns of Linaro engineers. This presentation will describe the proposed capabilities, deficiencies, and compelling arguments for adoption of remote LKFT labs by Linaro members.
