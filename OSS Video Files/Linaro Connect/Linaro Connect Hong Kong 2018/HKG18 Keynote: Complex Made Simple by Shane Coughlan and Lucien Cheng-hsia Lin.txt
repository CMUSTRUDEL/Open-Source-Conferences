at 11:00 a.m. in this room by Lucie

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,080
enchant from the open culture Foundation

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:14,519
and now please welcome Shane Coughlin

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:16,590
director of the open chain project hello

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,609
all and thank you so much for welcoming

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,650
me back to Len ro Connect I was here a

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,430
couple of years ago with Harold belt a

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,449
to talk about open source compliance at

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,669
that time Harold and I essentially

00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:34,760
talked about two different sides of open

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,370
source and compliance and governance

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,559
Harold talked about how the community

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,629
and individual developers view

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,039
compliance and I talked about how

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:49,410
companies view compliance now in some

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,190
ways that made a lot of sense to show

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,989
two perspectives but in other ways it

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,329
also makes it seem like there's two

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,620
communities one community of individuals

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,769
and one community of corporates in

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:07,799
reality of course here in open source

00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:10,020
we're all so interdependent then we're

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,060
really one community and we shouldn't

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:18,210
split things too far today is really

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,060
going to be about an assessment of where

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,409
open source compliance is and where

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,680
we're going next one of the key things

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,939
to start with probably that open source

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,100
is not a solution open source is a

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,970
fabric from which we can create

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,780
solutions and it has become so

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,930
successful that it is in every area of

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:49,700
computing today just a couple of weeks

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,530
ago I was at an automotive conference

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,409
where we talked about not only open

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,549
source in cars but open source across

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,759
the embedded cloud and enterprise system

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,570
as well and one thing that was evident

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,899
at that time was that everyone is

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,430
becoming clearly aware that open source

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,700
as a fabric as a platform

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,150
is going to be absolutely everywhere

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,939
that we do software and of course we all

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,019
know that software is absolutely

00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:29,409
everywhere that we do engineering

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:31,689
now given that open source is the fabric

00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:35,319
of computing given that it is something

00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:38,260
that we need it needs to be understood

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,870
how we will use it we need to have

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,560
shared rules we need to share the

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:49,209
results open source as I said is not a

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,459
solution in itself but it's 80% of the

00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:55,329
solution that you need no matter what

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:57,400
sector you're in because everyone needs

00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:00,090
it because everyone relies on the same

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,700
foundation we also need to rely on

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,120
shared rules shared understanding so

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,560
that we can get the results that we need

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,599
this has probably been one of the

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,319
greatest challenges in open-source

00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,419
governance in the early days well how

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:22,389
many of you were in this field 20 years

00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:25,989
ago oh god are we dying off already in

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:28,829
the early days say 20 years ago the open

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:32,290
source community was so small that

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:34,959
basically we all knew each other and the

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,889
idea of having shared rules was very

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,560
simple now it's very different at a

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:45,569
conservative estimate we have tens of

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,909
thousands of contributors to Linux alone

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,150
we have an enormous community around the

00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:54,040
world of individuals and companies

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,699
across multiple geographies across

00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,430
multiple languages and across completely

00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:03,099
different understandings of let's say

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:07,209
legal approaches and the requirements

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:10,750
for things like copying and sharing this

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:14,560
has made it somewhat challenging to have

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,380
clearly shared rules and that in turn

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,000
makes it somewhat difficult to have

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,080
shared trust and great collaboration

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,900
this has been something that we've been

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,120
dealing with in the background

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:32,880
many years now we are probably at the

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,360
brink of some great solutions to make

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,690
sure that everyone is happy but we still

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:44,220
have a little bit of work to do the

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,800
challenges today fundamentally are based

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,229
on the fact that we're not looking at a

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,440
cell mall community with shared

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:54,449
agreements we're looking at a very large

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,260
community for some people have different

00:04:54,449 --> 00:05:01,169
understandings or different behavior and

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,600
on the edges of this community we have

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,090
faced some quite severe challenges in

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,350
the governance area how many of you have

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,360
heard of Patrick McCarty quite a few now

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,000
I know Heather was here I believe last

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,180
year and she mentioned Patrick

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,949
McCarthy's case Patrick used to be a

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,500
core developer and net filters a

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:27,030
contributor to the Linux kernel he had

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:29,900
quite a high profile he receded from the

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,560
active community of development and

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:37,800
began to undertake a series of lawsuits

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:41,550
based on his code in the German legal

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:46,440
jurisdiction now these lawsuits for the

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,979
first two or three years exposed the

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,659
slight difference of opinion between

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:54,710
some individual developers and some

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:58,409
corporate investors in open-source

00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:02,370
Patrick went after businesses that made

00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:05,300
mistakes in GPL licensing and in the

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,099
early days of his activity people said

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,690
well it sounds right he's fixing

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:12,919
something that's going wrong he's

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:16,080
forcing companies to behave and

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,409
companies said it's something a bit off

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,020
about this because we have Patrick

00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:24,419
approached us we have to sign an

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,139
agreement then he comes back with a huge

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:30,930
laundry list of potential additional

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,080
violations and requested substantial

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,450
amount of money and for a few years this

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,020
was going on for individual developers

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,060
and

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,509
aspects of the traditional development

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,580
community felt that nothing was amiss

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,770
and corporates were increasingly saying

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:51,900
behind closed doors something is

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:54,750
extremely amiss thankfully communication

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,330
started to happen and we began to see as

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,870
we talked with many people that the

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:03,629
stories were aligned essentially

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,159
companies were being shaken down and it

00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,259
had very little to do with community

00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,000
norms it had very little to do with

00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,960
doing what's right it had everything to

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,139
do at a profit motive around last year

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,479
we began to see businesses talking more

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,940
openly about what patrick was doing and

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,490
we began to see the overall community

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,599
engaging more actively in saying that

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,969
some behavior is quite harmful the

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,490
netfilter community released an

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:34,440
enforcement statement very clearly

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,960
stating that they believe everyone must

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,780
follow the licenses but also clearly

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,210
stating that activities such as legal

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,110
enforcement court cases should be a

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,330
matter of last resort not first resort

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,759
the Linux community released a statement

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,800
as well that statement was originally

00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:58,940
drafted by grant he's in the corner

00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:02,669
there and we saw additional activity in

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:06,210
lawyers such as Heather clearly

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:10,529
explaining why copyright trawling was a

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:15,440
huge issue I talked about this quite a

00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:17,789
bit because Patrick McCarty's activities

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,279
litigating for what appears to be a pure

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:23,699
profit motive were harmful to our

00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:27,000
community but more challenging is the

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,639
fact that he has created a line of

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,490
activity that could be inspirational to

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,640
more dangerous actors you're all very

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,930
familiar I'm sure with patent trolling

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,130
copyright trolling is the last thing we

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:43,589
want to see an open source I would say

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:47,970
that activity like that is probably our

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:49,350
largest single challenge today and it's

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,840
a challenge that we're working on

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,660
address

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:57,460
say but it's one that we haven't yet

00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:00,220
solved the solutions that we're looking

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,160
at an open-source for governance tend to

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,220
be about communication I mentioned at

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:10,060
the beginning of the talk that nowadays

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,910
our community is so interdependent that

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,770
you can't split it out by one handful of

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,960
stakeholders and another handful of

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,360
stakeholders you can't split it between

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,910
individual developers and corporate

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,790
investors it's it's quite frankly

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:27,730
impossible over 70% of the code

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,370
committed to the Linux kernel originates

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,980
in corporate projects but an aweful of

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:37,630
that a lot oflot of that code is made by

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:40,450
very high-profile individuals as we

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,550
acknowledge our interdependence as we

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,890
understand that we must always work

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:48,490
together in areas like law as well as

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:52,030
software we're beginning to apply

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:56,470
solutions that rely on a certain type of

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:58,780
community spirit with mccarty we had

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,600
clear statements from netfilter and the

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,390
Linux kernel saying that speculative

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,560
copyright enforcement is not something

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:12,520
that our communities support in other

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,650
areas such as corporate code we saw

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,650
clear statements from companies like Red

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:20,770
Hat and Google saying that when it comes

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,460
to let's say GPL 2 licenses they will

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:30,010
only enforce them in certain ways

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:32,170
similar to the GPL 3 license these

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,580
solutions have all been about coming

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,260
together agreeing on shared norms and

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,040
making a certain pledge or promise to

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:46,330
uphold them this is terrifically

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,540
important today when we're looking at

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:52,120
the cost of something like copyright

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,180
trawling we're talking about millions of

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,430
dollars when we look at the potential

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,790
cost of breaking collaboration in the

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,090
commune

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,640
of not having shared understandings of

00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:10,690
not working together we're looking at

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:12,730
billions of dollars of loss now as we go

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,120
through our solutions in this modern

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,340
world there's a tendency for the lawyers

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,230
to think every solution is a contract

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,990
and there's a tendency for the engineers

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,970
to think every solution is code I'm a

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:29,400
political scientist so I think that

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,400
every solution is an essay or manifesto

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,580
and it's actually interesting I don't

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,680
know if you've noticed it but somewhere

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,130
at some point political scientists like

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,590
myself permeated open source and we're

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,940
popping up in all kinds of positions the

00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,250
last president of Free Software

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,130
Foundation Europe was a political

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:54,160
scientist as well and I think the reason

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,770
you find disappearing is because it's a

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,880
social community it depends on social

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:03,370
norms and social collaboration the

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,400
solutions like I said are cooperative

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:10,780
and I'm going to give an example through

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,430
open chain open chain is a project

00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,880
that's been running for about three

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:20,020
years but it's only been public for

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:23,410
about a year and this project is about

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:27,550
addressing one simple question how do I

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:30,010
trust my supply chain and I think this

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:34,240
is probably a question that in an area

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:38,620
such as China people can really resonate

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,990
with talking with embedded companies the

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,130
average supply chain has between nine

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,230
and twenty seven hops going from the

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:50,470
initial silicon to a finished product

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,570
and because open source is everywhere it

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,360
tends to enter the supply chain at

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,790
numerous points and with so many

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,280
different hops where open source can be

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,200
introduced it's actually very hard to

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,420
keep track of everything and mistakes

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,070
happen

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:10,850
that's actually the weakness

00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:15,259
in industrial production that McCarty

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,899
manipulated no matter what you do as an

00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:20,509
endpoint company with your sticker on a

00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:24,529
finished product no matter how good you

00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:27,170
are at compliance one of your suppliers

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:29,269
somewhere might make one mistake and

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,699
that might fold into your products and

00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:34,579
that might hit market and you can do

00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:37,250
everything that you possibly can

00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:39,649
to try and catch it but because of the

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:43,310
complexity of code because of the speed

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:49,420
of products something somewhere will go

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:52,009
wrong in open source we had essentially

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,470
expected that when someone finds that

00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,709
something went wrong they'll let you

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,120
know and you can go and fix it

00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,819
McCarty was the first time that we had

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,850
someone who didn't care if you could fix

00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:08,089
it he wanted to get money out of you

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:12,380
from that mistake no matter what you did

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:14,480
next and this meant that we had a

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:18,199
serious problem with the global supply

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,149
chain I used to help GPL violations org

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:23,060
I used to run the legal department of

00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:25,130
Free Software Foundation Europe now we

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,829
used to do a lot of test purchases on

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,959
devices GPL violations would test

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:32,620
purchase and fsfe would help in

00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:36,500
analyzing what we should do

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:38,930
can you guess the percentage of test

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:45,079
purchases with an open source compliance

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:47,829
problem yeah 100% we never had a test

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,360
purchase that didn't find a problem and

00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:53,120
and that's fascinating because a lot of

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,019
these test purchases were from companies

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,480
which do try hard and really do have

00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:01,459
sincere contributions to the community

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,029
and we were looking at a supply chain

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:08,420
problem and that particular problem is

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:11,540
more than an abstract in terms of our

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,550
community we need to work on that

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,010
because we need to have shared trust

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:20,040
it's very hard to trust each other if

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:23,410
not everyone is following the same rules

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,870
in terms of our ability to use

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,690
open-source we need to make sure that

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,930
those hiccups in the supply chain are

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:35,339
less and when they do occur we have a

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:38,170
chance to fix them without big problems

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:41,470
regarding finance or distribution of

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:45,730
products now open chain helps address

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:49,089
this by well I suppose you could say

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,190
giving the big picture open chain is not

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:54,310
designed to be a prescriptive set of

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,310
code a prescriptive set of processes or

00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,520
a prescriptive set of policies this is

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,800
where we are a little bit left field

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,430
compared to a lot of other open source

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,950
projects open chain is about looking at

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,970
a legal entity and saying it's got

00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,010
inbound

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,110
processes for software it will have

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,220
internal processes and outbound

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,180
processes and what we do is we ask

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,250
organizations to confirm they have

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,610
certain processes in place

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,190
do you have an inbound process do you

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,440
have an open source policy do you have a

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,709
development process do you have an

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,680
outbound process we don't actually care

00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:39,070
what the process is we just care that it

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,800
exists because if the various companies

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,680
in the supply chain can confirm they

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,580
have these processes the likelihood is

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,690
they will catch open source software

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,400
entering the products and they can

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:55,390
describe it as it moves through the

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:58,810
supply chain that's why I said how do I

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,850
trust my open source supply chain if

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,240
they've got these processes in place you

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:07,329
can trust them more and as a side effect

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,400
as they make a list of their processes

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,160
internally they can provide that

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,350
information to their customers this

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,439
means that a company producing let's say

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,850
a system on a chip can actually tell the

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,150
purchaser who's putting it into a

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:26,709
product they can tell them how they

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:29,050
monitored the code internally this helps

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,270
a lot in reducing problems and it

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,670
indicates a very promising future for us

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,000
and

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:39,080
the source given when I told you about

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,020
our market situation number one we have

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,070
a huge community everything that is

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:48,140
software is related to open source

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:50,840
number two we have the emergence of

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,850
things like copyright trolls who no

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,690
longer follow the same community norms

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:59,060
as before number three we have a pretty

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,350
consistent and excellent track record of

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:05,240
having problems in our supply chain and

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:08,060
number four we're thinking through how

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:12,470
to solve them has led to an interesting

00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:15,440
mix of I suppose collaborations that we

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,550
didn't have previously it seems strange

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,770
to say it but the emerging and then

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,980
clearly understood threat of Patrick

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:27,140
McCarty brought together individuals and

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,530
lawyers and companies in a way that we

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,730
have rarely seen before an open-source

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:35,570
everything from software freedom

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,690
Conservancy x' guidelines for GPL

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,760
enforcement through to the statements by

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,830
Red Hat about how they would deal with

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,700
copyright enforcement around their own

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:51,410
code has put us more in tune than ever

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,350
before and this harmony this

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:56,140
collaboration has led to some

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,570
fascinating and brilliant results

00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:04,280
Patrick McCarthy had a case just a week

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:07,280
ago quashed in German Court not because

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,820
they rejected the GPL not because they

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,380
threw out enforcement as a viable option

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:17,060
but because they said McCarty was

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:19,370
overreaching he was trying to use the

00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,370
combined work of the Linux kernel as

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:26,980
something he could use for litigation

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:30,230
and the court said no your own

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,380
individual copyright is what you can use

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,270
in a case and you have not provided

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,440
sufficient evidence regarding your

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:41,289
individual copyright to maintain

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,929
current case and thus it was that an

00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:49,299
overreaching trawl was squashed in one

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:52,389
case he'll be back but we have a little

00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:55,240
bit of control about saying no you can't

00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:58,690
litigate with the whole kernel now that

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,700
particular case outcome didn't come from

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,610
the company that was defending itself

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,250
solely there was support given

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,590
affidavits given from all types of

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,789
individuals and community organizations

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:15,759
to help bolster that case and that

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:18,850
ladies and gentlemen is our future as we

00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,409
deal with open source growing we now

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,309
understand that we have to deal with

00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:26,590
governance in a slightly different way

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:29,379
one person's problem one organization's

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,649
challenge is a challenge for everyone

00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:35,500
using open source we need to have clear

00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:37,899
understanding of our rules and today we

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,139
have much clearer understanding than

00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:44,590
ever before grants work with the Linux

00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:46,929
kernel enforcement statement inspired

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,379
netfilter netfilter was first to market

00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:52,690
so they went on speed but it inspired

00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:54,399
netfilter to make their statement the

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,159
Linux kernel made their statement

00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,860
SFC released principles of GPL

00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,710
enforcement we've seen a terrific amount

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:05,080
of consolidation and the future is not

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,779
just statements and documents the future

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,200
is a lot of tooling to back this up I

00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,879
don't know if you know it but right now

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,120
we've got somewhere in the region of

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:19,629
eight or nine major projects helping

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,639
with describing open source scanning for

00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:24,940
open source and continuous integration

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:26,230
continuous development open chain is

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,230
basically at the top

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,509
we're like the ISO 9000 saying do you

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,029
have this overarching structure just

00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:36,700
below us there's a project called SPD X

00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:38,950
which says here's how you describe

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,190
what's in a file here's a license

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,539
identifier here's other identifiers x'

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,029
then we've got scanning tools like

00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:48,279
fossil adji and scan code that can

00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:50,490
automatically scan through your code

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:54,059
read the identifiers x' and tell you

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,200
what's there we've got C ICD tools like

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:59,040
quartermaster

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,890
we've got catalogue tools like SW 360 we

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,929
have new tools which have metadata for

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:07,620
projects like the recently announced

00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:10,679
clearly defined from Microsoft combined

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:14,550
these open-source tools and solutions

00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,860
allow us to have end-to-end governance

00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:19,230
that can be automated to a very high

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,650
degree and gives us a very good baseline

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:26,340
of where we need to be the future of

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:28,500
open-source governance is probably we

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,090
keep doing exactly what we're doing we

00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,820
keep working together we take this

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:36,270
momentum that was partially inspired by

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,970
a negative actor in our field and we use

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:41,070
it to make sure that our supply chain is

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,470
as effective as possible that where

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,860
mistakes occur we can identify them and

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:49,170
fix them as quickly as possible and that

00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,900
as a community we acknowledge the value

00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:55,080
of shared rules and shared understanding

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,240
we understand that the complexity of

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,750
software the complexity of the supply

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,150
chain may lead to mistakes but we also

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,850
clearly understand that we can and must

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:08,580
fix those mistakes so that we all remain

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,760
confident in open-source I'm very

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,970
optimistic about this future because in

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,950
just the last five years alone I've seen

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,860
compliance changed completely from

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,620
something that was individuals trying to

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,950
get large corporate entities to comply

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,900
in to having a pretty flat arena for

00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,570
virtually everyone agrees on the same

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,050
ideas and is working actively to support

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,710
them

00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:37,230
now when Heather spoke last year I've

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,380
seen her talk and it was an excellent

00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,480
talk and I think it highlighted the

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,630
sense of urgency we had around

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,820
compliance at that point what I'd like

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,240
to do what my talk is to underline that

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:54,030
we took the urgency on board and in

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,620
every area of our community we worked

00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,200
hard to address the challenge

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,890
and today we're in a great position to

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,370
have fair and reasonable compliance and

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,159
to address trust between organisations

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:12,820
and individuals it's a very positive

00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:16,240
moment compared to the slightly worrying

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:19,510
moment we had just 12 months ago now as

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,070
part of this we're getting better at

00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:24,610
dealing with the fact that not everyone

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:27,220
is from North America or the British

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,230
Isles or Australia and and I'm from

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,210
Ireland I'm from the British Isles and

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,950
then this is a colossal struggle for me

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:37,000
the idea that everyone doesn't speak

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:39,850
English but there you go

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,330
and that's where the next speaker comes

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,059
in

00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:45,820
so Lucien is going to come to stage and

00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:48,279
he's going to tell you a little bit

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,320
about license compliance in Asia first

00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,470
in English but then he has an excellent

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,260
talk coming up in Chinese and that's

00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,330
what's really cool the open source

00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,309
compliance community doesn't depend on

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,520
figures like me coming and talking in

00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:07,270
English anymore it's more of a beautiful

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,370
courtesy that llanera extended to me it

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:12,429
has great thinkers and great minds

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:16,510
available all over the world and today

00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:18,580
we have a Chinese speaker speaking

00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:21,790
Chinese and explaining how this works

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:27,000
please welcome Lucian to stage

00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:32,399
[Applause]

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,399
thanks friend for the introduction I

00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:41,639
think I have 10 minutes to do the Asia

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,639
update about its license compliance

00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,059
according everyone my name is dilution

00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:54,870
and you are very welcome to come my

00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:58,419
Chinese name the in Changsha if you like

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:02,440
I have been doing the open source legal

00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:07,360
research for about 10 years about maybe

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,570
12 years ago I was the academic

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,879
professional in academia sinica

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:18,159
now I am the legal advice of open

00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:21,190
culture foundation Taiwan so what I am

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,399
going to introduce to you is fewer

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,740
description about the update about open

00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:29,350
source license compliance the situation

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:35,440
in Asia to be clear mainly in the

00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:37,299
current China area what I can share with

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,129
you in the past 10 years

00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:47,049
let's go back to 2005 d-link lawsuit

00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:49,980
back to 2005 I don't I think not

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:54,330
everyone in this room knows that dealing

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:57,519
lawsuit may be the first first one

00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:02,860
substantially reward open-source about a

00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:09,850
GPL infringement in whole word this it

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:14,250
is good in a public pool in Germany and

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:18,070
telling his Taiwan pastor ICT companies

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:22,809
it sells a lot of embedded system

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:26,649
equipment back to 2005 and 2006 as far

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:28,690
as I know people in Taiwan engineers in

00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:31,299
Taiwan in the ICT industry they really

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:36,400
don't know much things about open-source

00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:38,820
license and the GPL so

00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:43,450
most of the question they proposed to me

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:49,020
in the tent you know ten years ago was

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:52,390
such I think okay so there's a point no

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:55,830
no no points so okay there's a no laser

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,750
pointer so that let's just describe it

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,340
that's the whole question

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,430
most of our frequent the question they

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,930
proposed to me question number one do we

00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,440
really have a use of the GPO license

00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,540
code

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,040
I don't think electric propose this

00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,650
question to me unless you propose this

00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,870
question to RT departmental then self

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,059
the question number two what the

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,850
personal reinstatement means if we're

00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:21,490
not allowed to reinstate show the

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:24,970
product business to deliver by Kurt

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:28,450
order yes might be in serious serious

00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:30,640
situation on the trip here 2.0 and the

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,980
question number three why you have to

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,570
provide a so scoping written on our own

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:40,080
I think relay they just don't understand

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:43,030
their staff are doing the development

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,750
based on others people's open source

00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:49,929
code at the question number four how can

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:52,000
the product be up a few skated so that

00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:57,700
no one will know less the GPL license

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,410
and material inside whenever they posed

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,830
this question to me I will let you know

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:07,090
that my ability in engineer is limited

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:09,340
in debugging and testing so if a lady

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,110
really wanted to the officiating they

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,990
have to find someone else it to that

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,050
fall in but every time I were telling

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:22,330
that this will cost you a bunch of times

00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:25,450
and legally it will constitute some

00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:29,290
somewhat well for environment if it it

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:35,530
have been identified and tested question

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:37,900
number five our own sauce our own sauce

00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,940
Co had been lost because of the

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,300
engineers in charge already lapped

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,290
employment what can we do under the

00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,260
circumstances

00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,470
when will a saving a warning later for

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,390
source code

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,600
this is the real cast in real life

00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:56,540
actually it did happen a few times in

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,850
the past ten years so they don't have

00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,740
any repository or version control system

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,980
for the code that they use in the

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:09,200
product so what have been changing in

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:12,140
the past ten years after dealing there

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,710
comes a serious a lawsuit in the United

00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:19,040
States this is a preliminary injunction

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:23,920
issued by the federal court in the Union

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:27,530
United States it is a bitty box in 2009

00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:31,400
peepers with the help of her software

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:37,370
freedom Conservancy it pros the lose a

00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:39,320
lost blow lawsuit against 14 Famers ICT

00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:42,470
companies in the United States

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,040
as you can see same song is England list

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:48,760
and besides same song the other the

00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,990
other companies actually are the

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,500
partners of Taiwan o yen and the

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:58,010
audience so this is a series of lawsuits

00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:04,130
change compliance in current China area

00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:07,070
a lot after that that the company in

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,830
Taiwan and the company in mainland China

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,990
came for my consulting they don't ask

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:16,550
the question number one to number four

00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:19,460
five anymore they are going proceeded to

00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,050
the number six and seven what exactly is

00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,390
the scope of source code we should

00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,890
provide and how can we properly

00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:28,190
attribute which all the contributor

00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:30,410
notice and disclaimer with so many free

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:33,410
and open source components in one single

00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:38,000
one productive so as you may might agree

00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:42,190
there is improvement in attitude so but

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,190
positive in the open source components

00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:51,240
in the past two years a future a beauty

00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,760
company based on men in China even come

00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,550
to me about discussing about their

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,290
strategy they want to know how to put

00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:03,510
open-source management into the

00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:05,340
competing surgery in the future but but

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:08,040
for now we have to automate one since

00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,110
there is indeed different stinking ways

00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:14,060
between free and open-source communities

00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:18,000
and oh ye n OD n so-called manufacturers

00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:21,290
for the promoters and communities they

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,450
believe beautiful coding shall be out

00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:28,770
yet for the manufacturers I think I only

00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:31,950
want trying to market and for

00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:34,590
communities they believe intellectually

00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:37,920
right it can be only respectively but

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:40,440
for the manufacturers they just want to

00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,620
do if they can they just want to do the

00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,930
IP or management on his own for

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,910
communities every contribution of codes

00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:52,680
shall be attributed properly to an

00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:55,620
extent and for the manufacturers I think

00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:59,250
allay appreciate no extra obligation

00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,800
imposed and for the community so scope

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:05,690
shall be provided openly among

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:08,970
participants but for many manufacturers

00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:11,190
if awakened they think the source code

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:15,570
provisions should not income finish with

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:20,700
the company's benefits and overall for

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:22,770
communities sure the knowledge is the

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,680
one thing that they think they should do

00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:28,740
but the folder manufacturers I think

00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,750
most manufacturer that the department in

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,130
short they think and they just they

00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:36,630
really want to quit and know how

00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:40,500
confidentially internally if possible so

00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:42,990
after I think just as like Shane

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,200
mentioned open-source in today is like a

00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:48,360
fabric no matter you like it or not you

00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,430
believe or not it's a kind of a fun

00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,330
dimension we do the development of

00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:57,990
computing so finally we have to make the

00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:59,120
piece so how can we make the piece based

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,430
on experiments

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,070
I spent English open-source researching

00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,560
the past 10 years I think the main point

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:09,500
is that we learn the rules for on the

00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:12,140
license we honor the doers fungal

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,750
license and we have to find a way that

00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,430
Mehcad accompanies the manufacturers and

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:21,530
the community working together person

00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:26,740
positively so what I can share to you is

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:29,060
that if you want to make your company

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:32,210
compatible with the open-source license

00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:34,910
application the most crucial part is

00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:38,810
that you have to do the fundamental

00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:41,630
chaining for your engineers you have to

00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:44,510
let the engineers learn copyright spirit

00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:46,550
in training courses causes for the

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,820
better judgement because for open-source

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,550
they are different from a commercial

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:55,100
solution for commercial solution your

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,620
legal apartment will decide which one

00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,690
you should buy which one you can use but

00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,710
for the open source solution they are

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:05,990
you usually used by the engineers by the

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:10,520
research department itself so you have

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:12,890
the two diseases in training so I think

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:16,540
the most part I can contribute it to the

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:20,120
Nano connected this year is trying to

00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:23,300
share my experience about how to expand

00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:26,600
the implant word and in interactive mode

00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:30,020
with the developers that McClane can

00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,150
understand license obligations in simple

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,870
Wakeley but a simple way and the two

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:38,330
herbal way so in the 11 o'clock I will

00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:41,210
hold a workshop about common

00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:48,200
understanding of copyleft English very

00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:51,050
ruin because most of the scenario most

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,940
of the miss Anton's misunderstanding

00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,250
scenario are collected for on the

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,280
current China area the workshop will be

00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,860
delivered in Chinese Butler the slide of

00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,980
the workshop are made both in English

00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:05,360
and the Chinese so if you find anything

00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,500
interesting to you

00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:12,410
in lost light please fear of every me to

00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,140
send me your suggestion or finding a

00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,750
through the email so thank you for your

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:26,180
patience and attendance for the update

00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:28,070
now before you get rid of us off the

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,950
stage because technically we still have

00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:35,720
a tiny bit of time I wanted to give you

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:38,390
two two insights one is that a couple of

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,400
years ago when I was dealing with

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:43,100
governance people would often talk about

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,280
mainland China as if companies didn't

00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:49,970
understand copyright and that's always

00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,730
been incorrect and some companies in

00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:56,360
China deserve to be given credit as

00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:58,970
leaders in open-source governance fall

00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,310
way for example has had a great open

00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,980
source team for many years and has been

00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:07,460
very proactive in working with the

00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:09,500
international community so one thing I'd

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,510
like to stress is that even though we

00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,520
come from different cultures we have a

00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,910
great amount of shared understanding of

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,930
what we need for third parties to work

00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:23,720
together the second thing is to give I

00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,940
think a rosy picture of the dark deep

00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:29,930
underground of compliance what really

00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:34,280
what really happens out there in two

00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:36,290
years between 2006 and 2008 when I was

00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,890
running FSM fees legal department and

00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:41,990
collaborating with GPL violations we

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:46,040
addressed and solved upwards of a

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:48,350
hundred and fifty cases and less than

00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,880
one percent needed to be taken in to any

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:56,090
form of legal interaction the vast

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,280
majority of cases at that time when we

00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:01,010
got a pure 100 percent score of in

00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,380
compliance no matter where we looked the

00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:07,280
vast majority had majority of the cases

00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:11,030
were resolved by communication and by

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,670
collaboration and since that time now 10

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,410
years later we've got a lot better at

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,570
this and I think Lucien is one of the

00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:20,720
key examples of someone who has spent

00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,880
over a decade going around training

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,490
people non-stop and it's had a

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,869
tremendous impact

00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:31,089
on bringing us all closer together so

00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:34,569
this workshop at 11 I think is a bit of

00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:36,520
a milestone for us Lucien has been doing

00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:39,369
workshops in mainland China

00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,589
I believe in Taiwan as well helping an

00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:45,069
awful lot of people understand but

00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:47,349
today's workshop kind of is a a moment a

00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:49,210
milestone where a very large

00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:52,150
international community with a very

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:55,299
large international conference gives a

00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:57,099
track in the local language on this

00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:59,049
topic and gives plenty of room for

00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:01,059
people to have great learning

00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:04,270
I think Lonardo deserves great credit

00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:06,760
here for making that happen so on that

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,440
note thank you very much all appreciated

00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:16,569
your time and if anyone's got an urgent

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:21,839
question we can take it now or later hi

00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:21,839
