so first of all this is a little bit of

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,180
an experiment it's the first time

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,970
actually I'm using my Qualcomm arm

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,150
tablet running Windows 10 and attached

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,769
to it is that Lennar Oh HDMI dongle so

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,609
if anything goes wrong I'll blame it on

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:20,369
the dongle so with that I want to talk a

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,949
little bit about how we run as you are

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,350
is the second-largest cloud in the world

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,269
and as you probably heard we're doing

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,529
quite a lot of things with arm and so I

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,570
want to talk a little bit about that as

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,940
well I want to talk about how that is

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,620
relevant to arm what we're doing what

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,930
kind of things we're building hardware

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:43,140
platform software but also talk a little

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:47,160
bit about the challenges so Ezzor is a

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,930
humongous set of servers across the

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,270
whole world one of the really

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,879
differentiating things in Azure is that

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,680
we go where our customers are and we do

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,960
that for a few reasons we do that

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,510
obviously for performance reasons

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,010
bandwidth reasons latency reasons but

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,199
we're also doing that for regulatory

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,570
compliance reasons there are lots of

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,880
reasons cut for example when you have

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,040
customer data in Europe you're not

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,409
allowed to move that customer data out

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,840
of Europe again so a reason for us to

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,240
have data centers there we call these

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,090
regions we call these combinations of

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,770
data centers regions every region has at

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,790
least two data centers and we do that

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,070
for failover

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,930
so we can basically lose a data center

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,060
and still continue operations on the

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,159
other one I am and we currently have

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,270
regions in every continent of the world

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,549
except for Antarctica we're growing like

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,710
gangbusters so I think last year we

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,060
doubled our infrastructure doubled the

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,670
number of servers we doubled our revenue

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,270
and to give you an idea of that I'm

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,280
gonna show you two pictures so here is a

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,040
bird's eye view of a data center in

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,930
Virginia here you seeing two data

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,790
centers various generations but if you

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,479
look at those trucks you get an idea of

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,759
how big these things are this happens to

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,350
be a site where we actually run one of

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,149
our government data centers we actually

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,890
one of the would things we do if you're

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,180
a large enough customer will actually

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,920
build a special-purpose

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,719
data center for you and as you can

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,879
imagine it's typically governments that

00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,969
like to do that we do that in the UK we

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,469
do it in Germany and so obviously we've

00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:24,269
got some special restrictions around

00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,430
that as well who can get into those data

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,359
centers but to give you an idea of how

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,189
much we've been growing so that picture

00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,920
that you saw in the previous slide is

00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,099
that blurb that is on the top right

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,099
since then we've built a new data center

00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:44,639
and we've clearly broken a lot of ground

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,919
for the rest of the growth and that data

00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,319
center that you see there right at the

00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:53,959
top that's actually our standard format

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,980
that we nowadays use there for buildings

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,609
interconnected with an enormous amount

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,560
of fibre basically projected for for

00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,969
network bandwidth for the next twenty

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,450
years because that's typically how long

00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:09,269
these things last and we provide just to

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,280
give you an idea 40 gigabytes at this

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,739
point we provide 40 gigabytes between

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,450
any server to any server in those four

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,629
buildings right so that's sort of the

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,190
speeds and feats that we're driving and

00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:22,440
clearly this is growing like gangbusters

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,659
and this is one of many data centers

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,180
that we have around the world I think at

00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,239
this point were probably around or well

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:35,669
over 150 data centers in the world and

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:38,459
growing so we've been in this data

00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,669
center game for a long time almost 30

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,280
years and so we started off back in the

00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,439
early 90s with building standard

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,900
infrastructure so you put up a 19-inch

00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,930
rack you build individual servers from

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,049
vendors you wire them up to a network

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,169
it's basically hotspots of things right

00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,379
so they're very labor intensive they're

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:04,290
not particularly efficient so the metric

00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,870
that you see at the top of this block

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,120
PUA stands for power utilization

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,560
efficiency it's a number that was going

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,139
to buy the green grid computing

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,389
organization and what that is is it

00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,759
represents the total power that you

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:20,659
spend on a data center divided by the

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,010
amount of power that you spend on

00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:26,610
billable

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,990
billable hardware billable components so

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,760
this is your computer this is your

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,530
networking that kind of stuff but it

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,270
doesn't include things like your air

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,280
conditioning or other kind of other

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,530
cooling mechanisms that you have work

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,200
backup power those kinds of things so

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,390
clearly a factor of two is quite

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,280
expensive so one of the things you'll

00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,350
see over the next couple of blobs is

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:51,240
that we're actually reducing that to a

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:54,420
much much smaller number so in 2007 we

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,730
really started to do this in earnest and

00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,670
what we started to do really is build

00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,400
custom design of custom VAX

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,230
standard servers but in custom racks we

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,240
would all pre configure them and we

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,920
would very much focus on driving the

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,720
cost down and really getting more

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,940
density out of it get more and more

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,880
scale and by the way one thing I want to

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,340
point out is that with all of these

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,050
steps we grew and it's kind of

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,560
interesting that in the data center

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,930
someone who told me that's if you go to

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,300
medical school half of the things you

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,310
learn in school right will be proven

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,560
wrong by the time you're at the end of

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,570
your career and pretty much the same is

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,390
true for building a cloud data center as

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,220
well because you get new insights when

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,170
you go from a hundred thousand to a half

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,540
a million notes when you go from a half

00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,550
a million to a million and so on but you

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,620
go to two million and beyond there are

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,720
constantly new things that you learn and

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,710
we're constantly experimenting things

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,440
and changing things so second generation

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,770
is very much focused on density how do

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,360
we pack as much as we can the third

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:04,350
generation is actually where we

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,560
introduced zones so we had cold aisles

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:09,630
and hot aisles so you've got cold aisles

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,070
that's where the cold air comes in you

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,990
would suck it through the machines

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,730
through the notes and then you would

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,520
have a hot aisle where you would exhaust

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,620
it out and one of the things for example

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,860
that we do is we actually have all the

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,020
i/o be on the front end of the machine

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,640
so that the operators actually are in

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,740
the cold aisle while working on that

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,960
because those hot oils can get pretty

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,770
hot indeed and so you don't really want

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,690
people to work in that

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,419
you'll be sweating like a pig in you

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,520
there that clearly induced the

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:44,770
efficiently a lot we went actually to

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:48,370
one point two and one point five we then

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,139
started looking at pots so one of the

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,090
challenges that we have is in building

00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,009
data centers does that eight if you

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,419
build a building you put it full of

00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,819
machines but you need to get an

00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,409
occupancy license for it even though

00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,870
there are hardly any people in those

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,400
data centers you still need to make sure

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,860
that people can actually get into the

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,509
building and it's safe for that and it

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,389
can quite easily take six months or more

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,250
to get that license so as we're growing

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,960
quickly right we're building these data

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,919
centers we don't have to wait six months

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,210
to go and get that occupancy license so

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,610
what we started doing instead is

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,860
building pots or containers so these are

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,020
literally the first one was literally a

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,360
shipping container and we put it full

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,169
with servers and there were basically

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,110
three inputs cold water power and

00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:37,509
networking and that was it and in

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,250
Chicago one of our data centers near we

00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:41,440
literally put these things out on a

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,419
field wire them up and we were up and

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,490
running the problem of course with these

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:48,340
kinds of pods is that maintenance isn't

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,400
that great so it's difficult you don't

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,520
have a lot of space to work in they tend

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,919
to be very dense so with the six

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,349
generation or the fifth generation we

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,259
actually went back into our data centers

00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:05,710
but we did focus very much on Software

00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:07,360
Defined so we build smart Nix pushed a

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,930
lot of the complexity out into those

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,620
kind of devices that again drove the ple

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,729
high or lower so more efficiency and now

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,069
we're actually on the sixth generation

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:22,569
and I'll talk a little bit about that in

00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:24,009
a minute so but before I continue with

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:28,539
that let me talk a little bit about what

00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:30,729
our arm server approaches so last year

00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,680
we actually publicly stated that we're

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:35,789
evaluating arm for use in our data

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,890
center and we're still evaluating arm

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,300
actually a lot of efforts around it

00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,860
there's a lot of software that need to

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,190
be ported before you can operationalize

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,320
that

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,870
but the reason we're doing this is

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,090
somewhat confusing people I always still

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,430
get requests or still questions from

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,620
from journalists is like oh you're only

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,950
doing that to drive down the cost which

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,510
isn't actually the reason if it was cost

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,270
we would actually just stick with the

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,150
suppliers that we have the problem is

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,340
that we have only one supplier and so

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,770
given the rate that we're growing like

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,050
if that supplier ever has a hiccup or

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:16,290
anything or any other kind of challenge

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,660
we cannot grow that's the situation that

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,850
we want to get out of this is not about

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,650
cost in fact if you look at arm servers

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,570
they're probably over time are going to

00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,400
be more expensive than other servers out

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,680
there because there are just it's just a

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,660
function of scale right on the arm site

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,220
the skill isn't there so designing a

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,350
motherboard building a motherboard is

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,450
gonna be more expensive than building a

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,270
motherboard for the commodity part with

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,580
a high skilled part so the main reason

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,770
for us actually is supply chain reasons

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,720
we want optionality we want to be able

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,630
to continue to grow we do not want to be

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,700
blocked growing because we're dependent

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,720
on a single supplier and that supplier

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,310
has an issue we're also doing it because

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,840
we want to take advantage of innovation

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,120
and we want to actually see more

00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,190
innovation in the server space and we

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,930
think that arm is a much better

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,210
ecosystem to go and drive that than

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,670
anywhere else and obviously it also

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,340
helps that we do have things like client

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,020
builds windows client which is still

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,330
with a lot of other applications depend

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,670
on so it's a much easier porting effort

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,660
for us than anything else so we're also

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,420
interested in creating a healthy

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,880
ecosystem why not interested in one arm

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,650
server player we're interested in

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,660
multiple arm server players so we're

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:31,350
working currently with three two of them

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,050
have been public welcome caveum and we

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,210
actually there's a third one wants to

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,770
remain an infamous at this point

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,220
although probably most people in this

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,900
room know who they are and then there is

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,870
actually a other ones that we have been

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,660
able to mean arm for example on the

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,060
things they're doing our running Windows

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,350
Server and pair actually just showed

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:57,079
this week at OCP summit back in

00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:02,839
in Santa Clara that they're running

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:04,430
Windows Server so we are interested in

00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,680
Windows Server but we've only been doing

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,610
that for internal use that is another

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,160
thing that I've gotten a lot of

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,709
questions over the reason for that is

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,569
where we see the opportunity like taking

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:17,269
on and building an operating system and

00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:19,790
providing a 10-year life guarantee for

00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:22,779
that is quite a commitment now if we

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,639
look at this market right we see a

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,620
growth on cloud tremendous cloth of

00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,680
growth wind cloud the kegger is around

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,199
40 percent if we look at enterprise

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,980
standard enterprise there is basically

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,649
no growth

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,839
it's a stabilized market so from our

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,540
point of view the opportunity isn't an

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,639
enterprise right moving a stabilized

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,670
market to a different architecture is

00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,139
extremely difficult and expensive and we

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,940
just point out we don't see the

00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,100
opportunity now obviously if that market

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,279
whatever to materialize we have the

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,769
capabilities but for this point at this

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,720
point we're not doing a retail version

00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:05,329
of Windows Server we're only focused on

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:08,209
our internal applications the key focus

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:10,610
is on internal cloud applications and

00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:13,850
with that I mean applications like

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:15,920
search you can think of it as sequel

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,990
service all those kinds of things

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,610
that where we actually control the stack

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:25,130
and it doesn't expose the x86 Ness right

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,079
deck you see and B X so the traditional

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,120
VM hosting business is not something

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,399
that we're seeing going to arm anytime

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,829
soon unless there is an ecosystem around

00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,690
that that builds up but without that

00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:37,790
ecosystem we're just focused on the

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:41,329
internal applications we're also

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,100
developing Hardware one of the things we

00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:45,199
do is we actually build our own servers

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,360
we do that for cost reasons we do that

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,339
for quality reasons and so we're doing

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,750
the same thing and the arm space and

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:54,319
I'll show you some pictures on it later

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,389
on so where do we see the opportunities

00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:58,880
well I already mentioned search and

00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:01,069
indexing um we got a lot of servers

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,350
devoted to that high performance storage

00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:06,439
is an obvious candidate because again

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,320
the stack is what we control there are

00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:08,910
no user app

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,420
patience running there are no use of the

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,310
m's running it's all our own code

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,470
machine and big learning obviously is a

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,490
taking up a larger and larger percentage

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:22,320
of our data center capacity and so on

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,200
platform as-a-service again anywhere

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,110
where the ISA doesn't shine through wait

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,940
is actually a good candidate for arm

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,860
servers and when I talk about arm

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,020
servers the ones I'm working with are

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,310
building high ends high-performance

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,910
servers because that's what I'm

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:41,310
interested in I'm not interested in in

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:43,320
putting a bunch of a 53 cortex a53

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,210
together because that's not sufficient

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,220
for my work clothes most of my work

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,380
loads still benefit from single threaded

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,210
performance improvements now if you add

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,100
all these properties up it turns out

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,110
that's well over 50% of my data center

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,240
capacity so there is actually a very

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,980
good opportunity for arm servers now

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,270
obviously there needs to be a value

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,740
proposition right so that I think is the

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:09,570
one that we are still having challenges

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,010
with so here's an example of what we

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,020
have done and I'm sort of focusing on

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,670
Windows Server that we're running the

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,010
pictures that you actually see here on

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,500
the side our task manager running on a

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,450
caveum pox cabin to pee box and the only

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,910
reason I'm showing that is because it's

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:27,420
sort of cool to show up 256 Hardware

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,010
threads executing but obviously we have

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,740
similar kind of things on other hardware

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,830
platforms running we do have Windows

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,240
Server builds again for internal use

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,980
both core and fool is what we're

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,050
building we actually have the full

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,870
compiler support that's actually part of

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,490
Visual Studio 17 that you can actually

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,460
download and you can use it on those

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:51,330
client systems as well we're integrating

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:54,540
hyper-v we actually have over 500 arm

00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:56,340
servers in in Microsoft for our internal

00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,770
developers so that's what we're using to

00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,940
develop performance testing all sorts of

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,400
kind of things that we're doing with

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,870
that in fact we've got so many arm

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,280
servers that we even surplus things some

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:11,180
of the arm servers right now because

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,180
they're too old and to not very powerful

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,800
and we have that of that list that I

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,680
just showed a number of those properties

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,059
are actually evaluating our server so

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,579
what's still missing

00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,109
a lot of performance optimizations right

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:27,569
the thing that the benefit of the x86

00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:29,369
ecosystem is that you've got about 30-40

00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,139
years of performance optimizations both

00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:33,539
into compiler and libraries and other

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,219
parts of the system we missing that on

00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:38,039
the arm side and we're definitely seeing

00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:40,409
that the other thing we're arm is

00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:43,169
actually running ahead of some of the

00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:45,599
x86 architectures is the high core cones

00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:47,839
and the interesting Numa properties that

00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:51,809
come with that once you start running

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,839
256 threads on a single box hardware

00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:58,019
threats they're very interesting things

00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,559
that happen in the OS windows definitely

00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:04,079
has its share of issues in the scheduler

00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,299
and stuff like that my understanding is

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,209
that Linux has a lot of the same kind of

00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:11,279
issues so it's kind of interesting that

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:17,089
we're with arm platforms running into

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:21,419
that first okay project Olympus

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:24,059
so project Olympus is a hardware project

00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:27,179
and it's a think of it as a modular

00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:29,729
approach of how we build Hardware so we

00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:33,389
built our own Hardware in Microsoft for

00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:36,449
cost reasons for reliability reasons for

00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:40,319
support reasons we really liked as much

00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:42,809
uniformity as possible and so we built

00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,839
standard chassis and that go is a pretty

00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:47,909
standard motherboard yeah we put some

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,729
other things on it but in overall it's a

00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:52,679
standard sized motherboard and the way

00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:55,019
we really differentiate a lot is

00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,339
actually in the power supply so when

00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,349
you're in every continent of the world

00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,419
one of the biggest challenges is

00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:02,609
actually get power in all those servers

00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:05,490
and do it in such a way that you can

00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:07,529
build once SKU of servers and deploy

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,939
them everywhere and so the way we've

00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,949
done that is we've actually build a

00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,779
special power supply it gets three

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,549
phases of input and really the only

00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,649
thing we change these racks go

00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:18,600
everywhere around the world the only

00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:20,689
thing that we change are the power

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,869
connectors that you see on the upper

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:28,289
right side there the nice thing about

00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:30,299
this modular architecture is that for

00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:32,789
arm I only have to focus on building

00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,690
motherboards right I do not have to

00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:37,509
build an entire server it's one thing to

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,820
how do I get Arman to Azure it's another

00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:41,440
thing if I had to build standard servers

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,240
with that that I would wire up to

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,399
everything it has all our secret sauce

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,720
and that kind of stuff I don't have to

00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,240
deal with that right

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,460
I built a motherboard and those were the

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,929
board's we've been building we've been

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,720
building three

00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:58,090
we've have one with Foxconn and caveum

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,190
we build an earlier one with invent ech

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,559
and we've also been working closely with

00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:06,129
Qualcomm as you saw with all the

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,480
announcements in early 17th and again

00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:09,399
the nice thing about these motherboards

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,289
is they just slide into our standard

00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:13,600
machine so it just fits in our standard

00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:16,990
deployment model they're the same size

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,149
the same configuration roughly and so

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:23,440
our operational people know how to deal

00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:27,039
with this so let me talk about some of

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,590
the challenges in the army ecosystem and

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,379
I know you guys as an organization have

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:36,490
worked on this a lot but standards are

00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:39,580
an absolute requirement for armed 64

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,169
adoption at scale and it's also an

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,850
ongoing dialogue it's not something that

00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,559
you've done once and you sort of stuck

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,700
because there are new things that we

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,200
learn and there are like for example

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,870
recently a CPI introduced something

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,929
called the PP TT table it's a new way to

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,700
describe Newman notes and how caches

00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,909
relate to everything this is how

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,980
operating systems optimize things this

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:05,350
was actually driven by the arm folks and

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,629
we actually are using this we're

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,580
planning to use this on the x86 side too

00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:11,289
because we see a lot of the same

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,840
challenges that the arm systems are sort

00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:16,649
of running ahead with on the x86 side as

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:22,990
well but that standardization is

00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:25,360
absolutely critical hyper scale is about

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,190
increasing scale and reducing complexity

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,980
right when you've got very complex

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,429
solutions time scale that doesn't work

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,250
at all

00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:35,559
so we simplify things a lot again that's

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,600
why we build our own systems and that's

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,669
both from a technology technology point

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,759
of view as well as the supply chain so

00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:46,350
you'll have you see me speaking out very

00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:51,270
publicly around things like open BMC

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:53,880
as you ATK - because when I deal with my

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,980
partners if I have to add a third one to

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,650
it or a fourth one to it like an IB V

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:02,610
alright it increases the complexity for

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,870
me to manage all of us sticking to the

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,690
standards that we already know and love

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:09,660
love perhaps not for everybody but

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,640
definitely know is support that reduces

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,520
the friction it reduces the barrier to

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,970
entry and one thing that has been quite

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,740
complicated for the our Miku system is

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,380
that frankly hardware bugs a

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,840
non-standard design I not my problem

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,690
right that's why I'm developing multiple

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,600
and if you've got a hardware bug you fix

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,390
your design I'm not going to change my

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,150
operating system because I can deal with

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,520
having multiple Hardware fixes or

00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,590
hardware workarounds in my operating

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,500
system and that has literally happened I

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,780
have forced partners of mine to do an

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,299
entirely new spin out a tape out of

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,070
their part and put some new major

00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:53,539
functionality in it quite late in the

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,539
game because they were non-standard

00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:00,330
[Applause]

00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,909
still there are a lot of business

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,890
challenges so we're sort of at this

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:07,650
interesting spot where we're finally

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,539
seeing capable arm servers definitely

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,330
sort of at the Broadwell level and

00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:14,370
hopefully next year we're gonna see some

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,980
better ones that are even getting higher

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,419
than where the other competition is but

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,850
unfortunately there's also a lot of

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,860
server fatigue in the industry right

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,350
when I go and talk to I spent a lot of

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,929
time talking to my fellow cloud vendors

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,280
on my fellow cloud partners because yeah

00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:30,600
we're competitors but you know what

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,510
there are also areas where we're also

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,789
looking for collaboration because in the

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,159
end we're interested in commoditizing

00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:42,330
things like for example hardware right

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,679
we all benefit from scale and some of

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,840
these companies have been experimenting

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,380
with arm for over 10 years and they

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,960
started out with 32-bit processors and

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,120
it didn't cut it for their workloads and

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,059
so their senior management remembers

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,409
that right and so you have to overcome a

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,100
hurdle with them which is quite

00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:01,780
challenging

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,270
I still get a lot of complaints that

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,670
there are no ecosystem that provides

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,660
turnkey solutions again I talked to a

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:13,030
second tier cloud provider here in China

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,220
in last November and they said yeah work

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,070
out wise the performance is there it

00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,440
could sufficient for our needs but we

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,690
just we pull down apps and we try to

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,430
compile them it doesn't compile right or

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,290
we need this particular component and

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,570
there is no arm version for that so I

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:32,650
think that's sort of our next challenge

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:35,230
to get that level of of support in there

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:38,020
now from my perspective I go after

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,430
applications that I control right and

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,370
even that is a challenge because

00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,520
Microsoft has a lot of code right and so

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,470
things like we're on the x86 side we

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,300
have optimized encryption algorithms

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,520
optimized CRC check subs

00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,260
none of that stuff exists on our so

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,850
that's where a lot of our effort is

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:59,770
going the other challenge is still there

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,380
there's a lot of consolidation happening

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,840
in the semiconductor space and that

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,930
actually is making the arm Server future

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,840
pretty uncertain at this point okay so

00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:13,360
let me summarize so I think that as an

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,450
ecosystem we've made good progress both

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,700
on the hardware in the software front as

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,650
I said we've been driving hardware

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,420
vendors to make changes to it there's

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,010
been an enormous amount of enablement on

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,430
the Linux site largely through this

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:30,340
organization to go and standardize that

00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:31,510
and those standards are paying off just

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,730
to give you an example

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:37,510
all the arm partners I've worked with so

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:41,620
far we always required some fairly deep

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:43,690
debugging on both in the Windows to go

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,760
and figure out firmware bugs or in some

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,230
cases do some Windows workarounds

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,150
although our earlier said we don't

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:53,410
really do them obviously it's not

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,820
entirely a black-and-white story but all

00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,440
of them we had to do something special

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,090
with them and work with them and get

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:03,520
things to fix um last year um pair came

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,410
to me at that point they was still a

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,350
p.m. and they said we want to run

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,030
Windows I said look I'm unable to

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,270
support you right I've got over into my

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,760
hands full with Mighty

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,410
I can't take you on I'm happy to give

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,380
you access to the binaries but you're on

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,790
your own and so they went away they came

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,740
back to six months later and they said

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:25,040
we think there is a bug in Windows

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,200
because we can't boot from sada or the

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,140
direct-attached asada which is the sada

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,940
attached to the ax I interface and I

00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,380
said nope it works on other systems

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,300
literally that was the only thing I said

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,250
it works on other systems just fine and

00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,559
they went away came back the next day

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,179
and said yep we found the problem

00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,130
it wasn't the firmware we fixed it and

00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,020
they brought it up they were the first

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,900
armed server partner that brought up

00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:50,120
Windows without any of our help which is

00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,920
a big deal because unlike Linux where

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,630
you can look into the source code or you

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,820
can modify the source code to make it

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,530
work because I've seen the Y - with

00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,670
Windows you just get the binaries and

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,170
you don't get to change anything

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,059
and you don't get to look into the

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,860
source code so I think that's a

00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:06,080
testament for the standardization effort

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,230
state you guys have been driving and

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,900
they're actually paying off so format

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,690
Microsoft is your perspective we're

00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:18,140
maturing we're focused obviously on

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,780
targeted applications os/2 laying

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:23,510
workloads that kind of stuff as well as

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,190
the hardware designs there is sort of an

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,679
interesting stage at this point since

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,840
Microsoft is being the first one and so

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,420
far the only one to go public on arm

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,730
servers all of Wall Street is looking at

00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,610
me to make this thing a reality so

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,320
really my focus is on deployment inside

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,070
of Asia and I'm not gonna make any

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,780
statements about that here by the way

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,910
but as I said those business challenges

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:51,050
still remain so I don't know whether

00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:54,350
we've got time for questions I think we

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:58,010
can take a couple of questions really

00:25:54,350 --> 00:26:02,860
fascinating stuff do you have a hand mic

00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:06,590
that we could use maybe great

00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:11,930
anyone I'd really okay why don't we

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:15,110
start right over here so when you see

00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:20,570
them there is a reason of supply chain

00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:22,340
so how do you see the AMD servers Oh AMD

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,720
is very much part of our strategy as

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,500
well right

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,820
but what we're after is optionality

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,500
right the challenge a little bit on

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,080
betting on an ecosystem with on a

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,600
duopoly with only two players where one

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,880
can outspent the other significantly but

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,220
it creates lots of business risk as well

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,870
now on the other hands AMD is much

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,480
easier for us to adopt because there's

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,340
no software hurdle right so but they're

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,800
definitely part of our strategy as well

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,200
so we have a multi-pronged strategy that

00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,060
includes both and don't forget Intel is

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,130
our biggest partner right we work very

00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,960
very closely with Intel and they've been

00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,240
a very good partner to us and will

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,220
continue to work a lot with them so it's

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,110
not like we're actively trying to get

00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,120
rid of Intel it's just that from a

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:14,840
business perspective right for us to

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:15,740
grow we need optionality there are no

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,590
more questions

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,040
I just want have a little bit of a

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,470
shameless plug at 2 o'clock today there

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,720
is a panel where lenders is going to be

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,910
part of with some other folks from the

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,730
industry that well-known in this crowd

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:35,000
come on down ask these questions think

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:37,390
of questions and we'll be happy to host

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,390
you there

00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:49,490
do you think Microsoft Word participate

00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:52,140
in the consolidation within the industry

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,950
I'm sorry I think you had a lot to drink

00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,040
last night

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:58,470
[Laughter]

00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:03,150
do you think mark salt would participate

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:05,280
in the industry consolidation as a way

00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:09,300
of potentially protecting yourself and

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,170
his investments and well that depends on

00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,300
how it plays out

00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:16,470
right I I'm not really gonna comment on

00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:18,570
that here but we definitely have the

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,220
ability to do that it's the real

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,800
question is does it make sense for us to

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,540
do that right I think on arm what we

00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,790
want to see is an ecosystem with

00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,370
multiple players that's why we're

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:32,400
enabling more than one we are expecting

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,560
to see some consolidation I think what

00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,170
we're seeing today is a little bit more

00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,010
than we had anticipated so I'd like to

00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:42,560
leave it at that

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,560
so if we have time for one more anybody

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:48,530
okay okay Lina thank you so much for
