★ Session Summary ★
Having been around for so long already, many who view keynotes and sessions are jumping in at a bit of a learning curve. This session will take the explanation of Linaro and 96Boards back to basics. Focusing on the what, why, and how things get done within these two segments at a very high level.

00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,189
96 boards also if there's any questions

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,779
just feel free to raise your hand right

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:29,369
but 96 boards started in February 2015

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:32,520
this is almost when I showed up to

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,770
Lennar oh and I got two actually one

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,129
year later so I started in February 2016

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,930
and Lennar had already been a 96 words

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,829
had already been established now why did

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,180
96 boards come to be at least from my

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,790
understanding and I know there's many

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,020
different reasons however back in the

00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:54,180
day getting your hands on the latest arm

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,800
technology the latest RMS OCS and

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,130
getting the chance to develop on this

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,200
hardware was a little bit easier said

00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,310
than done right the the devices that you

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,079
would have to buy the development boards

00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,829
that you would get costed a lot long

00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,750
lead times and and so 96 ports kind of

00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,210
wanted to tackle this issue they created

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,430
a set of open hardware specifications

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,469
and I think I put did I put quotes on

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,170
Mel I didn't even put that quote okay so

00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,580
open hardware specifications it quotes

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,920
around the hardware specifications

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,020
because the hardware not necessarily

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,240
needs to be open but the specification

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,940
is the thing that's open and it is

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,920
actually a very beautiful thing because

00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,990
when you take into account all the

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,750
people all of the minds that went into

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,229
developing the specification that people

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:44,909
build this Hardware around you end up

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,500
with something that is is really you

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,130
know easy to work with and easy to use

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,610
right it also benefits those who are

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:57,450
working with it yeah so anyways a series

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,640
of hardware specifications SOC

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,110
independent right so across the

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,650
specifications you have the same

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,840
hardware but different SOC s so seamless

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,530
development transitions between your

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,230
development and and yeah moving forward

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,560
with with 96 boards you can go read more

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,239
about it on 96 boards org of course from

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,439
there you can branch off to all of these

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,870
different initiatives that we've been

00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:27,150
working on and and we'll talk about

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,140
those initiatives right here I don't

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,900
know why I have an extra bullet point

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,220
but from 96 boards that argue can branch

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,069
off to so many different things that

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,400
we're working on and this goes more into

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:41,370
my line of work so my line of work is as

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,920
community manager maintaining and kind

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,190
of managing these different initiatives

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,110
that have a public-facing role for 96

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,550
boards the first one list of course we

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,989
talked about the hardware specifications

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,520
this is something that again is

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,140
collaborated on by everyone that is

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,570
involved with 96 boards

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,160
the next thing 96 boards open hours so

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,860
you get opportunity to see that later on

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,959
today in about an hour we'll have a lot

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,550
of fun with that but not only are we

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,370
doing do we do this during connect but

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:16,440
we also offer this every single week

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:18,810
without stopping what is it one hour a

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,930
week for 96 weeks right so I'll talk

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,410
more about the history of 96 boards open

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,930
hours later mezzanine community this is

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,950
coming up right now by the gentleman in

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,380
the front row here they're going to talk

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,220
to you all about that community projects

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,989
so we host helped maintain and push out

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,000
to the public all sorts of 96 sports

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,410
community projects these are all open

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,680
source repositories and libraries you

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,079
can go visit open-source academics this

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,329
is a initiative that I was hoping to

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,630
talk about more during this Connect but

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,280
unfortunately was unable to however we

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,470
do plan on talking about this more in

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,230
the next connect and if you tune in to

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,910
open hours from now until the next

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,220
connect you'll definitely hear a lot

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,040
more about what we plan to do with that

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,420
I'll give you kind of a hint but what

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,630
we're trying to do is we're trying to

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,290
bridge the gap between industry and

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,180
academia we want to provide industry

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,220
with the opportunity to collaborate more

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:26,150
with academia and in turn incentivize

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:29,550
academia to offer various incentivized

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,260
returns to industries so when we

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,950
actually launched this it will be very

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,539
exciting I promise you and the 96 board

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,130
standardized libraries so we have people

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:40,650
within 96 boards who are working to

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,590
standardize libraries across our

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,509
families of families of boards yeah so

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,130
lots of exciting stuff going on and if

00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,389
you have any questions about that we can

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,789
always talk about it later if you find

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:54,289
me around connect I'd be glad to talk to

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:54,289
you about any of these initiatives

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,250
