Session Name: HKG18-416 - I'm BFQ, I'm dynamite (or almost ...)
Speaker: Paolo Valente
Track: Kernel


★ Session Summary ★
BFQ has greatly improved over the last months.  Now it handles I/O at
up to 400+ KIOPS with commodity CPUs, and extends its close-to-optimal
responsiveness guarantees on any single-queue storage medium, from
eMMC to fast SSDs.  In this presentation we show these improvements,
and:
- show how the work 'around' BFQ also influenced the benchmarking
arena: from the consolidation of a responsiveness (application
start-up time) test in the Phoronix benchmark suite, to the entry of
the same test in the MMtests suite;
- prove the good match between BFQ and the new blk-mq support in mmc
(Ulf&Linus work), with demos and graphs;
- provide an update on the status of the proposal of BFQ as the
default I/O scheduler for all single-queue storage;
- list the next important challenges for letting BFQ enter the
server&cloud world too.
