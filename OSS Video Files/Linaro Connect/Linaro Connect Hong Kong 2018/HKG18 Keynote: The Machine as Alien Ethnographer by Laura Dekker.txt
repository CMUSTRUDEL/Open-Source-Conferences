[Applause]

00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:11,719
the button I just need to fiddle a bit

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,719
first

00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,660
okay

00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:35,510
so wow there's so many people here still

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,790
I'm really impressed yeah thank you for

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,220
being here and thank you for inviting me

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,900
and Cantor I know you can't hear me

00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:47,210
because you're on a plane but thank you

00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:49,699
for bringing me here yes so I'm going to

00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,629
talk about the machine as alien

00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:56,600
ethnographer that's I was thinking about

00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,640
Mike the work that I do I'm I'm I have a

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,900
technical background but I'm a working

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,520
artist now and using technology and my

00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:12,110
work and it seemed that machine as alien

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:21,320
ethnographer seemed to kind of speak

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:23,150
about what I tend to do so I originally

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,920
I was working in the intelligent systems

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,740
group at University College London which

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,840
is when I met Kanter she was doing we

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,320
were both working on genetic algorithms

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,630
at the time and then I got more involved

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,940
in the machine vision side of things and

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:42,920
then I spent quite a few years working

00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:47,180
on 3d imaging of the human body and then

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:51,520
set up working commercial R&D and then

00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:53,870
set up a a company to do that and then

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,270
after some time when we sold that

00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,730
company I suddenly thought actually

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,640
there's this whole other side that I

00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:04,370
want to explore and I decided to study

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,830
fine art which I did at Central Saint

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,319
Martin's in London and then more

00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:15,349
recently at Goldsmiths College in London

00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:18,440
and since then I've been working as an

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:23,420
artist all around the world mostly

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,849
festivals and some working in kind of

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,920
white cube galleries but mostly out and

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,920
about in quite unusual locations

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:41,050
so that's enough of me what I wanted to

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:47,250
start with is you might recognize this

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:49,570
it's an excerpt from an ancient

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,750
encyclopedia called the celestial

00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,630
Emporium of benevolent knowledge in

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,800
which it's declared that animals can be

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,390
categorized into exactly 14 categories

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,590
those that belong to the Emperor

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:09,100
those are embalmed tame suckling pigs

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:12,220
mermaids or sirens fabulous stray dogs

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,180
and this one I really like included in

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,670
the present classification frenzied

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:23,200
innumerable drawn with a very fine camel

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:26,860
hairbrush etc having just broken the

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:33,190
water jug and finally ones that from a

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:36,040
long way off look like flies so so if

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,980
you recognize that though it may be

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,000
because it's from an essay by the

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,800
Argentinian writer Boris and if you

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,320
haven't read anything by him then you

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,630
must because he's absolutely brilliant

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:55,690
some of them are just half a page long

00:03:52,630 --> 00:04:01,180
and in that half a page he can set your

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:03,250
mind off on amazing journeys another

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,070
place you might have seen it is in

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:09,100
michel foucault the philosopher in his

00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,530
book the order of things he talks about

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:16,770
this not because it's amazing and absurd

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:20,910
but he says that this short passage

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:25,540
shatters our usual way of thinking and

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:29,230
and in this amazing exotic taxonomy that

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:33,310
boar has presents it's not just the

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,860
charm of that alien taxonomy it's

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,920
actually that it suddenly makes us

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,370
realize about the limitations of our own

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,100
thought and

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,900
so that's kind of the background behind

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:52,740
what drives most of my work this idea of

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:56,040
of thinking kind of trying to try to

00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:00,350
think outside of usual ways of thought

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,520
and there's quite a big philosophical

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,270
movement in the last 10 years or so

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:10,130
which has got various titles of and

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:14,250
through and I can't say this ante

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:20,430
anthropocentrism or the posthuman or the

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:23,550
nonhuman and generally these schools of

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,070
thought are about taking the humor from

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,880
the centre of thinking and and

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:33,389
reconsidering what it is to be human

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,419
some of it is technologically driven so

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:39,900
the idea of of trying to remove this

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:43,770
idea of rigid boundary between human and

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:48,180
machine or generally the tools that we

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:51,150
use and we're not just human and then

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,669
the machine is this other thing we have

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,610
an extended self that makes use of those

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:02,479
things even some technology as simple as

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:05,010
a pencil or the more sophisticated

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,810
technologies which actually are not to

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,180
set my timer you know this this

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:14,070
technology that is an extension of

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:16,050
ourselves to and there so this is

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,080
breaking the idea breaking down barriers

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:22,680
not just in human machine but also all

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:26,010
sorts of categories that get projected

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,930
onto us like gender and sexuality and

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:30,690
ethnicity and all those things so trying

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,710
to think outside of those boundaries and

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:37,620
what it might be to move those also

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,440
thinking about the agency of objects so

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:44,400
not just human is the only thing having

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:48,630
agency but machines having their own

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,680
agency and Indian objects like this

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,680
having its own agency

00:06:52,340 --> 00:07:00,110
so this is obviously in anything you're

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,120
always applying some kind of assumptions

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,130
and biases but it's kind of shifting

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,590
those assumptions and biases in in

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:12,980
different ways and and seeing what

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:16,550
emerges so finally some of my work this

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:22,490
is just a little example of it this is a

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:25,520
commission that I had in 2013 there's a

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:31,340
an organization called secret cinema in

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:33,110
in Britain and they they choose kind of

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:40,600
a usually a current quite a cult film

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:45,290
and then they staged this incredibly

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:47,750
deep intensive in immersive experience

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,390
that you sign up to this you don't know

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,280
what the the thing is gonna be or where

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,530
it's gonna be and then at the very last

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,870
minute you you're told of the secret

00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,090
location that it's going to be so they

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,030
invited me to do this thing for the film

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:04,490
Brazil and I hadn't never seen the film

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,820
Brazil and they said great we don't want

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,190
you to just be too much following the

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,980
film but these are the themes that we

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:17,030
want you to think about so I made this

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:19,930
this thing with these giant eyeballs so

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:23,870
this was projected enormous enormous Lee

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:26,420
with this giant tank of giant eyeballs

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:32,060
that kind of bobbed around and then they

00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:35,660
they follow the follow the people around

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:41,050
and they bounce off each other and you

00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:45,980
can see their pupils dilating and so on

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:50,930
so that the so the idea that it was

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:54,980
really thinking about so the these alien

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:58,160
objects are kind of looking out at you

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:02,570
and try as if they're so wanting to

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,510
interact somehow this was also at the

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,639
error for won five awards in

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,430
in San Francisco and there was projected

00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:18,519
about 12 meters wide on on a side of a

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:20,800
building which was great fun for me so

00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,800
back to this idea of the machinist as

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,920
alien ethnographers so my work tends to

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,279
be it's about a nonhuman entity

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,010
exploring the human world attempting to

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,399
provoke you as an audience member to

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:40,360
play and also it's about the Machine

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,790
creating on its own terms so if that's

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,199
possible the idea of a machine might be

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:50,529
creating things that are not controlled

00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:56,860
by by a human and if a machine might

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:58,720
have its own aesthetic so we don't don't

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,360
not quite even sure if that's possible

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,260
but it's interesting to think about it

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,230
so in doing that I think I've found

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,540
computation as an artistic tool has its

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,899
very particular thing that you don't

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,930
have with other art media is that in

00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,880
computation you can do pretty much any

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:24,850
kind of transformation that you want to

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,740
do and then by because the machine is

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,110
basically just manipulating a symbol

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,149
which you can interpret in any way that

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,430
automatically makes it possible for

00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:37,240
things like synesthesia so you're taking

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:39,910
data from one domain and transforming it

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,550
into a completely different one so it's

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:46,000
quite is just incredibly exciting it's

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:51,160
such a rich area there seemed to be no

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,529
limits on it so the kind of the tools

00:10:51,160 --> 00:11:00,430
that I'm using in this so mostly open

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:03,910
source stuff work a lot with open

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:06,130
frameworks C++ and increasingly with

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,149
Python because pythons brilliant for

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:12,610
natural language processing and I use a

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:17,470
lot of open data sources

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:21,160
and lots of so I was going to do a demo

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,230
but I I'm not I'm not actually going to

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,769
do Esther day but normally I'll be using

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:30,190
a lot of sensors and actuators as well

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:33,220
in the work and also because I don't

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,490
want it to be just about machines

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,320
there's also or kind of blurring the

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,260
boundary between a machine and and the

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,160
rest of the world I also bring in quite

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:49,240
a lot of organic stuff so even rotting

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:55,470
organic matter and and so on I don't I'm

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:58,690
not interested in slick I could quickly

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:05,890
hop through these ones because I don't

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:08,110
think there's too much time I'm gonna

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,910
help through to some more recent stuff

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,649
yes see one of the other things I'm

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,190
interested in is in the kind of the

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:18,040
discourses around AI in in like popular

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,070
conceptions of it and also how the media

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,279
treated this was a piece of work I did

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:27,250
two years ago because I'd been looking

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:30,040
at media output about AI and I realized

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,399
there were so many stories that were

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,820
hyping years and trying to install all

00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,230
sorts of fear into everybody and there

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,570
seem to be kind of five different

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:45,160
categories of the way that the media

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:47,589
would report about AI so eventually as I

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,810
was collecting these headlines together

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:52,420
and I decided to make a piece of work

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:55,600
about it and and the the the categories

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,180
seemed to be number one will a robot

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,880
take my job number two would you have

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:05,470
sex with a robot number three it was

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:08,680
about at AI ethics and number four was

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,070
seemed to be about kind of how AI would

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:16,180
relate to the rest of the living world

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:18,220
in so I saw that there was at the time

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,510
the the Dutch police had been training

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:26,950
bald eagles to to take down League

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:30,760
drones and they are and the final

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:33,700
category there was a article in I Triple

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,510
E spectrum about what Alan Turing really

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:41,410
thought about AI so I did these together

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:45,850
and decided to build five little robots

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:52,530
that would each act be an actor and act

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:58,270
out one of these headlines so this was

00:13:52,530 --> 00:14:01,090
this was a show that I was involved in

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,580
called technology is not neutral with

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,860
the so these are the five little robots

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,750
sort of moving around so I programmed

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,270
designed and programmed each of them

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,790
with different various different

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:17,710
capabilities to kind of try to embody

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:23,170
those those headlines so there's this

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:24,820
one here is the Google AI e3 need to go

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,350
back to remind myself what the headlines

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:32,860
were the yeah so this is an article in

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:37,420
the the UK's Daily Mail called Google AI

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,970
ethics board remains a mystery and so

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:44,740
the the kind of the little policeman

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:49,720
there is representing the the Google AI

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:53,820
ethics board on the right would you have

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:58,390
sex with a robot it was this this little

00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,280
thing that had a sort of capacitive

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,580
touch sensor shell so that if you

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:09,420
stroked it it would emit kind of cooing

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,420
sounds the

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,319
second from the right is was actually

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,779
it's hard to see in this light but it's

00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:21,509
kind of piled up with hundreds of tiny

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:24,839
little figures of people that's the will

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,730
a robot take my job and in fact on the

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,490
BBC online you could actually type in

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,500
stuff about your job and it would give

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,800
you a percentage likelihood that your

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,290
job would be taken over by a robot and

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:41,939
mine was luckily quite low which was

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:44,579
only four percent and then so there's in

00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:48,930
the middle there's the the trained bald

00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:59,790
eagle taking down a drone and then on

00:15:48,930 --> 00:16:01,889
the left here is is Alan Turing so they

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,089
would interact with each other sort of

00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:08,370
following each other and have

00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:10,889
confrontations and in the end actually

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,779
they though they were running for three

00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:14,250
months and they ended up being quite I

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,819
kept having to go and repair them

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:20,970
because he got quite battered and and

00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:23,250
children quite like to grab and and pick

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:26,459
them up as well which was fine that's

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:32,100
one of the hazards of doing public

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:33,899
public artwork so this is what I'm going

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,870
to go into quite a bit more detail this

00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,600
is a work that I've been I'm ongoing

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:48,470
work that I've been doing for the last

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:50,939
year and a bit and the idea is that

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:56,189
there's this machine that has built

00:16:50,939 --> 00:17:00,240
itself from all sorts of discarded parts

00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:03,740
and it's then trying to explore the

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,449
world in which it's found itself so it's

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,390
with its camera it's looking around and

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:13,319
it's tasting what it sees in the world

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:16,309
and then in response to that it writes

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,309
poetry

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:33,290
so there's a is it's projecting its

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,680
poetry down onto the floor and those

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,270
taste meters are showing the different

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:42,170
taste levels of what it's what it's

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:44,480
seeing so I trained a neural network to

00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:49,370
associate I trained it on with video

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:52,510
clips of it's all based around this idea

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:55,520
of something generating itself from

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:58,610
rubbish or discarded things so I trained

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,520
the neural network on rubbish heaps

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:04,910
compost heaps rot rotting and discarded

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,990
things with so I assigned different

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:14,480
taste values to the different types of

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:17,030
rotting stuff and then based on those

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,850
rallies so there's salty bitter sweet

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:25,490
sour and Amami it takes those values and

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,710
uses those as input to choose what words

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,830
it's going to use when it's writing the

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,140
poetry so in this version I used to I

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,480
used a genetic algorithm for the poetry

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,880
but I've been working on easy Markov

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,190
models now which actually works

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,700
it makes me slightly more human

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:46,720
intelligible poetry than the genetic

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:50,200
algorithm was doing so it projects the

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,270
poetry onto the floor and it also has a

00:18:50,200 --> 00:19:00,700
little thermal printer for printing it

00:18:53,270 --> 00:19:07,970
out too and I'm going to see right you

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:10,710
should be running yeah yeah so that's

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,210
what it's see at the moment and

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,210
[Music]

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,190
yeah so you can see the this is say this

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:28,480
is the output values from the neural

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:33,580
network up there and at the moment it's

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:37,120
your your quite sweet and quite umami so

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:40,780
that the number two so top one is salty

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:49,390
then sweets then bitter then sour and

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:51,340
then Amami hmm that's interesting yeah

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:55,870
the left and the right side is slightly

00:19:51,340 --> 00:20:02,470
different and then the on the right here

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:04,960
I have to say I can't sometimes when I

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:10,660
see what it's writing I'm quite

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:16,210
embarrassed but it seems to be safely

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:20,410
not to there are some words in here that

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:22,950
the so I've fed various different books

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:26,140
into it and and some of the vocabulary

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,690
is a little bit risque but at the moment

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,370
it's not

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,590
that's tends to be the salty word so

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:40,050
actually the moment salty is quite low

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:40,050
and so it's not to sexually explicit

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:58,740
so I'll go in a little bit more detail

00:20:45,990 --> 00:21:01,049
about about how I built that oh that's

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,019
another version of it where actually

00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:06,299
built it in in a big warehouse and we

00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:08,490
invited people to bring in old bits of

00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,679
technology and we built this enormous

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,179
heap so the heap was about that high and

00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:19,559
about four meters long

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:23,460
old all sorts of ancient computers and

00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:25,889
junk there were some Commodores that and

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,289
at the end every invited people to come

00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:29,730
they could take stuff off the heap and

00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:31,889
take it home if they wanted to

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,470
everybody wanted these old Commodores

00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:36,840
and but actually they weren't they

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,850
weren't available because the person who

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,679
donated that wanted them back but people

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,210
lots of people were coming in and

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,399
looking at all the stuff in this heap

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,320
and saying wow I used to have one of

00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:48,299
those phones and they were really

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,730
enjoying just looking at the junk in the

00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:56,250
in the heap so this is the kind of

00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:01,110
general structure of this machine and it

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:05,039
is based quite a lot on Daniel Dennett's

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:08,669
view of the human consciousness so this

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:11,690
idea that that there are there's no

00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:17,039
centralized control of over the thinking

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:20,789
and there are these greedy processes

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,340
that are seeking input and producing

00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:27,450
their output without without an overall

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:30,809
controlling structure so in this example

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:34,200
so I have various ways that the machine

00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:36,960
can take input and it processes it and

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,639
stores those in internal states and then

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,710
there are these processes that will

00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:47,549
express the machines in the States based

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:50,460
on on the data that it's consuming and

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:52,850
then then feeding that to various output

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,850
devices

00:22:53,859 --> 00:23:00,580
so in this in the various perception

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,450
moseys are some example so I'm taking

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:07,429
input from from the webcam they're

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,619
compressing it and then feeding it to

00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,869
the neural network and that which

00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:15,409
produces the taste values which are

00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:20,589
stored and then those are picked up and

00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:24,169
used when it's expressing itself and

00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:26,659
this is the structure of how the Markov

00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:29,330
model that you've seen the output from

00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:34,339
is working so I trained it on various

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:37,460
text sources which then feed into the

00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:39,979
production process so it's based on the

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:45,200
probability in whatever the text inputs

00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:47,869
were when it's producing a new piece of

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,419
output the words that it chooses in the

00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:54,830
next step depends on the probability of

00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:57,589
what was read in in the source text I

00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:01,749
also make use of an extended vocabulary

00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:04,849
so depending on what the what the

00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:08,629
current stimuli are it will choose

00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:13,849
vocabulary from different categories of

00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:19,609
data so the sweet words are chosen from

00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:21,830
one vocabulary set salty bitter sour and

00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:24,379
umami and so on from from different

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:27,830
vocabulary sets so the new mommy words

00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:31,969
are taken mostly from technical sources

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:34,309
so for example programming in C++ by

00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:36,739
Paul trillion some of the words from

00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:40,009
that those those have gone into the

00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:43,989
umami vocabulary set and and I've

00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:46,789
particularly liked words like that have

00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:50,149
meaning in normal usage but I also have

00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:54,379
very specific technical usage like void

00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:57,229
member and private and overload and so

00:24:54,379 --> 00:25:02,919
on which produces the kind of ambiguity

00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:02,919
of those produces quite interesting text

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:15,039
and I'm running out of time so just

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:19,979
finish off the where where I produce

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,979
these artworks is incredibly varied

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:28,389
sometimes I work in in in woodland and

00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:31,840
parkland and that's just a nightmare in

00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:35,830
terms of trying to get this equipment so

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:40,799
I in in into these places with no power

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:45,460
sources so I've had that connects and

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:48,309
max up in trees and using enormous

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,539
portable battery sources to try and get

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:54,879
these things working and there are

00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:57,729
particular challenges in all the in

00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:59,080
various they using like working in a

00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:00,940
heritage property where you're not

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,659
allowed to drill into walls or anything

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:16,450
like that it each time is is completely

00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:21,429
different and so yeah I'm gonna close

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:25,960
here so generally I'm working using art

00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:28,599
as a as a kind of a tool for critically

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,109
analyzing things and trying to see

00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,940
things from a different viewpoint and

00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:36,639
being here this week I realized as a

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:40,899
consumer of open source stuff

00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:44,499
I feel the kind of the need to put

00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:47,349
something back into that ecosystem not

00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:53,499
quite sure I mean I apart from doing bug

00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:55,840
reports and stuff like that and yeah the

00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:59,529
last thing I wanted to say was was is

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,769
actually a quote from an Italian

00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:06,770
philosopher who she said that this idea

00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:12,290
of the thinking of the the posthuman

00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:15,380
it's an opportunity to empower the

00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:17,270
pursuit this is direct quote from her to

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,490
empower the pursuit of alternative

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,640
schemes of thought knowledge and self

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:25,670
representation to think critically and

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,920
creatively so to develop a more

00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:32,540
sustainable relationship with the planet

00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:36,280
and and its other inhabitants I'll

00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,280
finish that so thank you for listening

00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:48,020
