Session Name: HKG18-303 - Automotive Grade Linux (AGL)
Speaker: Dan Cauchy 
Track: Automotive;Ecosystem Day


★ Session Summary ★
The race to roll out new technology features, mobility services and autonomous vehicles continues to heat up across the tech and automotive industries. Over the past year, we’ve seen a flurry of M&A activity, partnerships and new alliances, as automakers and their suppliers realize that the software and hardware required for autonomous driving is too complex for any one company to develop alone. 
While this is a step forward, greater collaboration across the entire industry is needed to accelerate autonomous driving. An open source platform for automakers to share information such as map data, miles driven and scenarios tested could speed up production cycles and decrease time-to-market.  
Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) is an open source project that is bringing together more than 100 members across the automotive and tech industries to develop a shared software platform for all in-vehicle applications from infotainment to autonomous driving.

	00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,590
you

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,060
hi everyone sorry for the slow start

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:24,349
here we had a bit of technical

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,730
difficulty so seems to be resolved my

00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:27,740
name is Dan Kochi I'm the executive

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,790
director for automotive-grade Linux at

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,130
Linux Foundation and today first of all

00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,350
a little bit about me um I live in San

00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:41,480
Jose because Canada is too cold where

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,100
I'm from originally and I'm an avid ice

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,690
hockey player in fact I played in a

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,250
tournament last weekend in Las Vegas and

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,740
we won the whole tournament so I'm

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,940
pretty happy about that um so today I

00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:55,550
want to talk about AGL so I know that

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,280
some some of you are familiar with AGL

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,290
so what I plan to do is actually give a

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,829
short introduction for people that are

00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:07,400
new here and may not know about the

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:09,170
project then I'm going to give you an

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,850
update on some of the latest development

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,740
and then one of the reasons I'm actually

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,329
here is to discuss what's called a

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,390
reference hardware system architecture

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,280
expert group and we feel that we need to

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,810
collaborate with Lennar oh and our

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,750
members on this which is one of the

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,159
reasons I'm here today and then a quick

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,590
update on some of the other expert

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:32,530
groups that are within AGL and then

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,530
finally if time permits a Q&A session so

00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,810
how many people do this in their own

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,380
vehicles I'm just curious

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:44,780
yeah see it's pretty common right we we

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,780
buy a vehicle we drive off the car lot

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,049
and one of the first things consumers do

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,600
is stick a phone with a sticky in the

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:57,200
dashboard right and the reason you know

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,880
this has been prevalent is because the

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
automotive industry let's be frank has

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,960
not kept up with the smartphone in terms

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,439
of features and software and innovation

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,269
okay and there's multiple reasons for

00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,060
that one of course is because building

00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:13,909
software for cars is honestly harder

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,010
than it is for cell phones but that

00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:18,140
being said there's no reason why we

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,780
cannot change the way car manufacturers

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,480
build software the reason we've ended up

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,990
in this situation is because there's too

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,050
much fragmentation in the market

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:32,050
you have different art tosses of the out

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,030
there you have you know Microsoft you

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,510
have Q and X you've got multiple flavors

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,660
of Linux and what this has led to is

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,130
massive fragmentation where there's no

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,530
one operating system there's no one

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,540
Android for cars right and so what has

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,480
happened is we've not been able to build

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,600
an ecosystem of suppliers and developers

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,430
and a community around one platform

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,620
traditionally and this is why AGL exists

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,470
this is why we're here we're trying to

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,420
break that model and we're succeeding to

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:05,830
be frank and I'll show you some examples

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,800
of that today so what is a GL well pure

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,410
and simple were a non-profit open source

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,560
project hosted at Linux Foundation Linux

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,900
Foundation now has in excess of 60 maybe

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,050
even 70 open-source projects everything

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,600
from telecom to drones to all sorts of

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,400
things and automotive-grade linux

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,660
happens to be one of the largest

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,370
projects at the foundation the goals of

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,890
AGL as I mentioned because we're trying

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,450
to break this fragmentation in the

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,940
industry we're trying to build a single

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,750
platform for the whole industry that we

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,330
like to characterize as 70 to 80% of the

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,910
starting point for a production project

00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,480
so what we mean by that is that you know

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,590
the board Support Package the kernel the

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,010
middleware for things like audio

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,660
graphics 3d acceleration and then the

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,780
application framework the security

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,550
framework and the API is for things like

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,690
speech recognition and the API is for

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,970
navigation all of these should be

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,920
standardized and we shouldn't be

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,020
reinventing the wheel every time a new

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,670
vehicle comes out everyone should be

00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,980
using the same platform and the platform

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,890
should evolve over time and it's very

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,989
similar to the investment Apple has made

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,270
in iOS and the investment google has

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,370
made in android the industry needs to

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,740
make an investment in this platform for

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,300
the long term and this is why AGL exists

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,760
and that's the problem we're solving

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,890
today a GL very it's very important

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,050
point a GL is a code first organization

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,210
code first code first code first this is

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,620
what we talk about all the time and what

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,230
we mean by that is we do not have a

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,900
compliance

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,490
program we do not we don't have a

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,470
software spec because we believe that

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,480
those lead to fragmentation even more

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,460
fragmentation because then you will have

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,250
vendor a vendor B vendor C they all

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,690
claim to be compliant to the spec but if

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,010
you look at the code and the API is

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,130
they're actually quite different because

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,630
it's hard to implement very strict

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,570
guidelines for for things like

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,580
compliance so we are a code for it code

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,790
first organization what that means is

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,430
when you start an AGL project for a real

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,230
production vehicle you go to the AGL

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,320
website you download the code and that's

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,640
the starting point by doing so we're

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,560
ensuring that everybody is using the

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,870
same software and we can break this

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,340
fragmentation cycle and finally have a

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:28,190
single platform that everybody's

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:30,890
contributing to we're actually planning

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,420
to work on everything in the vehicle our

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,420
initial focus has been infotainment

00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,010
because this has been the the biggest

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,200
pain point for the car manufacturers in

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,970
terms of being on par with the

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,700
smartphone and the expectations of the

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,220
consumer but that being said we're

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,590
actually just about to release solutions

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,640
for instrument cluster heads-up display

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,650
telematics and then we're also going to

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,200
be working on functional safety a Dassin

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,850
autonomous driving so our Charter is

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,430
basically to work on every piece of

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:06,260
software in the vehicle to be based on

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,000
AGL in some form or fashion we have the

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,340
support today of eight major

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,730
manufacturers as you can see Honda Mazda

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:17,150
Mercedes Nissan Mitsubishi Subaru Suzuki

00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:19,580
and Toyota we're also in discussion with

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,830
all the major other manufacturers from

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,050
Germany from the US you can imagine the

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,460
ones I'm talking about we've had

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,890
discussions with all of them some of

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,860
them are actually using AGL already in

00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:33,650
their R&D projects but have not made a

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,910
commitment to join just yet so it's I

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:40,670
believe just a matter of time we have

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,710
quite a strong Board of Directors as you

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,580
can see we have several OEMs on the

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,510
board

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,040
big tier ones like Denso and Panasonic

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,550
semiconductor company represented by

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,490
renesis NTT DATA represents kind of the

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,580
in telecom aspect and then most recently

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,400
Amazon recently joined our board in

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,759
February so we have a very strong board

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,740
and we're able to get a lot of things

00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,610
done by having the support of such

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,610
strong companies

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,240
speaking of companies we now have a

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:17,360
hundred and twenty-two member companies

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,210
in AGL I believe that makes us the third

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,849
largest open-source project at Linux

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,470
Foundation in terms of membership which

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:27,199
is quite remarkable because when I

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,539
started running this project we have

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,190
only had about 23 companies so in just

00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:37,280
three years we've we've grown to 122

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,650
what I like about the fact that we have

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,590
122 companies is also the the variety of

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,780
different companies so we have all of

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,780
the major semiconductor providers -

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,509
automotive as you can see arm is a

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:54,020
member Lenora is a member but also you

00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:58,190
know Qualcomm and X PTI Nvidia renesis

00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:00,259
are all members of AGL we also have

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,940
several big tier ones like Denso

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:08,240
Panasonic continental Harman electro bit

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,949
several others and then we also are

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,409
attracting companies that are interested

00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,900
in the connected car in the cloud aspect

00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:17,690
such as NTT DATA you know they're

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,060
traditionally a telecom company or you

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,680
know more of a services type oriented

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,770
company and they're interested in

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,020
providing cloud services and back in

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,759
infrastructure for the connected car

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,860
same applies for a company like Adobe

00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,750
you would think what are they gonna do

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,969
install PDF in your car no that's

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,099
actually not not why they're there they

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,860
actually have an analytics business and

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,140
they believe that the car is a perfect

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,510
endpoint in the IOT ecosystem for

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,760
analytics and so that's why they're part

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,829
of this project and then finally Amazon

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,570
recently joined because they have three

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:53,630
divisions that are interested in AGL one

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,339
is Amazon AWS services for connected car

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:59,510
they've actually already integrated with

00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:02,060
AGL the Alexa team is doing speech

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,880
recognition on top of AGL and then

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,140
finding the Amazon music team I'm

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,240
talking to them on

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,700
actually building an industry standard

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,850
API for streaming content to the vehicle

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:17,900
mean meaning music and video and TV

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:20,330
shows and things like that one of the

00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:24,920
big milestones that we reached recently

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:27,890
we announced this mid last year the 2018

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,530
Toyota Camry is now shipping with a GL

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:33,320
worldwide so that's millions of vehicles

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:36,020
by the end of this year and then most of

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,910
the lexus will follow shortly after

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,950
towards the end of the year most of the

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,350
Lexus models will also be also be

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,890
running a GL so this is a major

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:49,640
milestone for us because for many years

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,500
many naysayers have said you know you

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,040
can't put Linux in a car well like I

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,440
hope that all those rumors are or Fudd

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,240
or are now over with this with this

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:07,300
proof another recent announcement is

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:11,360
that with Amazon joining AGL we actually

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,190
made a lot of noise at CES recently we

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,760
recently announced that we're forming a

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,990
speech recognition expert group the

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,570
reason this is relevant is because

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,180
there's no standard speech recognition

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,760
API in the automotive industry so we

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,620
believe this is the first what this

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,470
speech expert group is going to be

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,600
working on is they're going to be

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,120
defining an API because we want a speech

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,610
enable every app in the vehicle and the

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,380
API will be independent of the

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,540
technology underneath so what that means

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,130
is if you're an app provider let's say

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,740
you work for Spotify and you want to

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:48,920
speech enable your app you'll be able to

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,020
use our API independent of whether it's

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,060
Alexa or nuance or voice box or

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,820
whoever's technologies underneath and

00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,050
it'll work for all AGL systems that have

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:03,470
a voice rect solution so Amazon Alexa

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,050
nuance and voice box have agreed to team

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,570
up form the sector for group and define

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,610
this API for us so we think that's a big

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:15,440
step forward in bringing speech

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:17,930
recognition to the vehicle in terms of

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,920
our community we're approaching almost a

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,450
thousand developers on our commute

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,360
mailing lists so we welcome you to join

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,209
that the mailing list the primary

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,410
mailing list is called automotive -

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,519
discussions which you can find from our

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,339
website

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,339
like I said nearly a thousand developers

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:38,250
that's almost doubled in the past two

00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:41,760
years and then in terms of the health of

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:45,240
the community we've had 2.4 x growth and

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,420
code commits this past year we've had we

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,600
have almost 6.2 posts per day on the

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,250
mailing list which is a very very good

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,230
sign of a healthy community so we're

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,880
really happy to see that so you're

00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,160
welcome to join us on that on that

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:04,100
mailing list now in terms of releases

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,630
our primary focus like I mentioned

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,730
initially has been infotainment because

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,540
that was the the biggest pain point as I

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,300
mentioned earlier we've now actually

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:19,139
released 5 different versions of this

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,760
already the important part is that by

00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,459
the way we name our releases after fish

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,019
so if you see fish names everywhere it's

00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,269
just a fun thing we do that's the

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,050
software serious but the open source

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:33,620
aspect is fun right we try to have fun

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,060
so the latest release is electric eel

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,760
was released in January to coincide with

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,310
CES and then we had a lot of demos there

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,890
with over 16 companies showing demos of

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,600
AGL and their products running on top of

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,029
AGL which is exactly what we're trying

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,630
to do is build this ecosystem all around

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:53,880
one platform but the most important part

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,769
about these AGL releases is that we're

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,779
now hitting them on a cadence of every

00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:59,880
six months so we released one in the

00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,410
summer June July and then we will

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,810
release one around the January time

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:07,140
frame and the industry now is starting

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:10,380
to depend on those releases and actually

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,180
making multi million million if not

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,640
billion dollar product decisions based

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,550
on AGL releases coming and then they're

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,310
but they're building their product plans

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,260
based on a GL as well so this is what we

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:25,470
want to see this is the whole reason

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,269
like I said that AGL existed or exists

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,550
in the first place so this is why you

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:32,470
know these releases are important

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,759
this kind of an eye chart but I just

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,680
wanted to show you all of the things

00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,709
we're working on the best way to learn

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,839
more about this is to go to our wiki we

00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:42,670
have release notes on everything we have

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,769
documentation we have a documentation

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:48,579
website called Doc's automotive Linux

00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:50,110
org we've done a lot of work in the area

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:53,699
of middleware in this past release

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:56,110
especially around window management we

00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:59,170
basically took some contributions from

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,569
Toyota and others in terms of window

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,819
management where you're able to support

00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:05,699
multi display and even swiping from one

00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:09,579
display to the next with your fingers

00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:12,129
very Minority Report kind of stuff and

00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:13,990
then we also did a lot of work on audio

00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:17,170
we completely revamped the audio to be

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,730
able to do layering in the car so if the

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,009
navigation system is talking to you

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,709
while the radio is on and then an

00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:26,139
important Safety Alert is coming in you

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,060
need to be able to layer that and mix it

00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:30,100
or take over the audio we did all of

00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,800
that and now the audio is fully

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,839
configurable with a simple XML file so

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,910
you don't need to do any coding to

00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,569
define the layering in the vehicle which

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:42,360
is a big step forward anyways like I

00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:44,949
said to learn more about all of our

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,569
features and the latest release please

00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:50,500
check out our release notes on the

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:52,560
website ok so I'm sure everybody's dying

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,240
to find out which fish is coming up next

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,880
so our next one is going to be funky

00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,459
flounder so that's coming out in July

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,709
and then our next release after that

00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:05,410
will be grumpy guppy

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:08,019
which is coming out in January details

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:11,610
about what's in those releases is on the

00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,610
website and our wiki page as well

00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:25,120
speaking of these releases upcoming I

00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,790
mentioned instrument cluster heads-up

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,100
display telematics we're actually going

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,680
to have profiles for those three things

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,449
in the upcoming release and what that

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,490
means my profiles is we're reusing a lot

00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:38,439
of the same base code and because we use

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,360
Yocto and I know a lot of you are

00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:42,410
familiar with Yocto we simply define

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,990
different meta layers

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,350
to exclude or include packages based on

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:51,019
the solution the telematics solution for

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,540
example is headless so no graphics no

00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,190
display capability no HMI and it's

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,480
intended to go into things like fleet

00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,339
management for Hertz FedEx UPS and also

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,050
good old-fashioned cars with good

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,300
old-fashioned button radios but they

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,459
still need to have connectivity and they

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,430
still need to have Bluetooth support but

00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,660
may not have a fancy display and so we

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,430
have actually a lot of demand for that

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,970
we have companies like Suzuki that still

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,300
makes cars low-end cars like this so

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,220
that that'll be used for those solutions

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,740
and in terms of hardware it also runs on

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,920
lower performance processors which means

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:32,930
lower cost etc etc so this is why we're

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:37,189
releasing these different profiles we

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:40,220
support a broad range of boards we don't

00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:42,079
have any favoritism we just we we

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,329
support the boards that semiconductor

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,889
companies will help us with so if

00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:48,740
there's a board in the future that it's

00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,810
coming we'd be happy to support it we we

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,310
have certain list of criteria for

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,220
example the board has to be a reference

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,050
board purchasable and we need the

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,120
hardware so we need someone to donate us

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,009
some hardware but as you can see we

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,280
support where NSS our car to our car

00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:06,740
three Intel middle board turbot and

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,809
jeweled TI Jacinto the Qualcomm

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,220
Snapdragon dragon board the BeagleBone

00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:14,720
black sabre automotive from NXP and then

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,370
finally we do support the Raspberry Pi

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,010
even though it's not a real automotive

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,919
board you can still do app development

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,600
using our SDK which a lot of people do

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,640
because it's an inexpensive board it's

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,980
pretty decent performance and you can do

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:33,020
some app development using it okay so

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,179
one of the primary reasons I'm here like

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,679
I mentioned is I want to talk about the

00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:43,280
reference hardware system architecture

00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:44,720
or our HSA expert group so we we

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,190
launched this expert group over a year

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,830
ago and the expert group basically the

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,140
idea is to define the soft or sorry that

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,650
define the the future requirements for

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,270
reference boards for

00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:03,210
automotive so things like the number of

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,740
radar lidar camera sensors the

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,330
interconnectivity of all these things

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,150
what protocols are going to be used what

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,250
the bandwidth requirements are what the

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,720
resolution of displays what what is the

00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,740
requirement for that all of these things

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,680
and the the really nice part about this

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,440
group is that it's being led by the OEMs

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,660
themselves it's being led by Mazda with

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,470
heavy involvement from Toyota Suzuki

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,300
Honda and Subaru so far and we're sure

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,630
Mercedes will jump in and start getting

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:36,810
involved as well the goals of the group

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:40,200
are to reduce the gap between reference

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:42,720
hardware and production hardware because

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,760
today there is a gap and there will

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,670
always be some gap but we'd like to

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,230
minimize it as much as possible so that

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,930
AGL that runs on the reference hardware

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:55,530
can be easily ported as it is today but

00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:57,570
even more so to the final hardware with

00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,760
very minimal effort and so that's one of

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,260
the goals the second goal is define the

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,210
scope of the peripherals and the

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,650
interconnection of all these things so

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,650
in a vehicle there's a ton of

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,960
peripherals as you know there's like I

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,770
said lidar radar camera sensors rear

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,510
displays rear seat entertainment there's

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,940
DVD players there's speakers there's all

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,440
these things and you need to define how

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,320
these are going to be interconnected and

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,020
what protocols are going to be used and

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,990
then also one of the goals of the the

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,420
group is to define the separation of

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,480
hardware the the main hardware board and

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,400
what they are calling an extension board

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,390
which connects all those peripherals and

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,390
I'm going to show you that in a minute

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:47,010
so in an automotive system we have this

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,290
common area that really doesn't change

00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,050
from vehicle to vehicle because most

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,360
vehicles need you know navigation media

00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:57,450
playback they need telephony they need

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,780
radio support you have this common set

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:02,400
of things that that the vehicle needs

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,980
but then on the outside this is the

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,290
stuff that varies a lot because when you

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,890
go from an entry level vehicle a compact

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,020
vehicle all the way to a luxury

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,070
vehicle the peripherals and the type of

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,490
things that are going to be connect to

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,930
the system vary quite a lot and then if

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,450
you get into autonomous driving then

00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:22,410
you've got all sorts of sensors on top

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:27,060
of all of this and so this group is

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:30,850
defining this architecture meaning a

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:33,190
mainboard which has a SOC either a low

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,460
grade SOC for entry level vehicle or a

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:39,520
high grade SOC for luxury vehicles of

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:43,270
course cost is a big issue and then has

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,590
this extension board again different

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,500
types of extension boards for different

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,590
types of vehicles and the idea is to

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,990
have the separation of these two things

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:56,290
so that extension boards are

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,330
interchangeable with main boards and so

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,550
the group has actually defined the first

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:03,610
draft of this specification like I said

00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,800
led by Mazda the spec is completely open

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:11,290
it's on our website today so you can go

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:14,610
check that out and what we're planning

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:18,070
to do is define all of these interfaces

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:21,010
in the next few months and then have a

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,950
proof of concept that so far renesis

00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:27,130
Intel and Shima Fuji have agreed to

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:30,940
participate in our proof of concept and

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:34,120
the proof of concept is to have a board

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,920
based on Kingfisher working and connect

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,620
the extension board that is connected to

00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,010
both a Renaissance arc our three gen

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,930
three board and also an Intel main board

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,690
and this is the proof of concept we're

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:49,810
going to try to achieve by the end of

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:54,880
this year and demo this at CES Las Vegas

00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:56,230
2019 so the reason I'm one of the

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,020
reasons I'm here is I wanted you to be

00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,390
aware of all this because we really are

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,610
calling on lonardo members and SOC

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,850
vendors to participate if you're

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,110
interested and in terms of funding I'm

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,880
pretty sure some of these car

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,530
manufacturers are willing to fund some

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,050
of this effort because it's very

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:17,650
important to them we're not a hardware

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:20,680
group but we decided to let this project

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,130
run inside AGL it doesn't mean that it

00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,930
has to stay there forever

00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,930
but that's where the project currently

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,580
is like I said we're a code first

00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,040
organization so we're really focusing on

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,170
the code but in this circumstance we

00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,660
believe that the the code we're going to

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,640
be producing will be heavily influenced

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,490
by these reference architectures that

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,350
the car manufacturers want and so what

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,230
better way to let the car manufacturers

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,570
tell us what they want let's go build it

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,430
with with hardware vendors and then

00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,100
let's go support it with software from

00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:55,520
AGL so that's the whole point of this

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:59,090
expert group project we actually have a

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,900
timeline like I mentioned we're planning

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:06,080
to have mainboard development going on

00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:10,640
towards all the way to the fall demo

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:14,480
system by the end of probably November

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,150
or so and then eventually reference

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,760
hardware demo at CES Las Vegas as I

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,710
mentioned so again this is a call for

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,650
participation if you are interested in

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,850
participating in this please let me know

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,290
I'll give you a business card afterwards

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:32,000
and we'll figure out how to get you

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:36,710
involved okay so in terms of other

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,020
expert groups my my community manager

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,060
Walt minor always says you don't have to

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,210
be an expert to work in an expert group

00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,740
and that's absolutely true it kind of we

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,590
kind of regret calling them expert

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,510
groups because we want to actually be

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,400
inclusive we want people to participate

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,800
on the on the conference calls and

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,170
participate in the meetings and we're

00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:01,070
certainly not the type of organization

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:03,560
that you know you were very inclusive we

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,490
want everyone to participate so even

00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,170
though they're called expert groups

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,170
anyone can join our calls and

00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,330
participate in the project we have all

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,100
these expert groups today I'm not going

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,380
to go through all of them but I want to

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,090
highlight a few updates and key features

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,820
that are happening in some of these

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,160
things one of them is the virtualization

00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,630
expert group in fact at the back of the

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,210
room here today you have a current

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,520
concept they're an AGL member and

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:32,680
they're showing a great demo of

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,880
virtualization using two different ADL

00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,750
systems running one an instrument

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,300
cluster

00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,740
and one an infotainment system so I was

00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,660
actually very happy to see that when I

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,180
arrived today

00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,030
so the virtualization expert group is

00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:50,150
looking at use cases for virtualization

00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:54,230
hypervisors containers pretty much all

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:56,870
of that is within scope the the group

00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,600
will be publishing a white paper very

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,460
soon that will define the use cases and

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,530
then what we plan to do is that AGL

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,350
we're going to pick the top one or two

00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:10,340
use cases and go off and implement it

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:13,700
and there's a lot of demand for use

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,670
cases around running a GL side by side

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,020
with an R toss or something that can be

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,420
certified for safety critical

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,920
applications so that's one of the top

00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,280
use cases that I believe we'll end up

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,930
implementing so that that's the kind of

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,760
stuff we're going to be working on this

00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,700
white paper should be published in the

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,620
next month or so again it'll be open on

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,430
our web site and available to anyone who

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,930
wants to dive in and comment and we're

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,480
looking for comments especially from

00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:44,810
this group very knowledgeable people in

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,350
this stuff so please let us know if you

00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,350
want to participate

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,070
I mentioned the speech recognition

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,070
expert group this group is super active

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:58,180
now we just launched it about a month

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,100
and a half ago group meets every week

00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,450
amazon alexa nuance and voice box are

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,580
leading the effort like I mentioned

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,040
before and we're gonna speech enable

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,080
every app in the vehicle that's the goal

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,410
here and we're already in discussion

00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,540
with Spotify and and Amazon music and

00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,680
others to speech enable those apps to

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,870
make sure that they're going to be

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,730
available in the car and actually

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:24,620
another cool thing I'm actually talking

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:26,500
to harley davidson because they're super

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,580
interested in this because they're

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,130
obviously you can't take your hands off

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,380
the you know off the by sar off the bike

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,790
when you're writing a bike and they want

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,350
to be able to speech enable the apps

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,680
that are used with harley-davidson

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:44,660
motorcycles using AGL so that's that's

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:47,030
pretty cool we also recently launched a

00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,010
vehicle to cloud expert group that is

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,549
responsible for defining things like IOT

00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,429
protocol

00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:54,980
cloud connectivity connected car

00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:56,330
features remote vehicle interaction so

00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,710
you can control and start your car

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,710
remotely especially in a cold-weather

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,659
environment Identity Management we

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,450
actually had a company called Ford Rock

00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:07,489
showing a demo with AGL where you take

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,289
your key fob and your identity follows

00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:11,419
you with the vehicle that you're even

00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:15,049
rental cars could would be able to

00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:17,179
implement this Identity Management for

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:20,360
example you come up to a car key fob

00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:23,539
gets swab your Spotify favorite playlist

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,279
gets immediately downloaded even your

00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:27,739
subscriptions for apps that you've

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,299
bought get downloaded everything

00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:31,460
instantly so that's the kind of stuff

00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:33,289
this group will be working on and of

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,659
course location-based services very

00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:40,039
important we have a lot of AGL members

00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:42,440
that are you know purely interested in

00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:43,940
location-based type services especially

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,600
the companies that are traditional

00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,190
telecom companies want to be part of

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,049
that ecosystem to provide all the

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:57,109
backend infrastructure needed to get

00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:58,789
this done what's next the board of

00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,730
directors of AGL is actually approved

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:06,259
and as approved funding to start working

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:09,649
on functional safety there's a movement

00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:13,369
within Linux foundation to actually get

00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:15,049
a small version of the Linux kernel

00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:17,149
meaning you know not the entire device

00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:19,330
tree but some version of the Linux

00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:25,129
kernel with the real time stuff

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:26,989
certified for functional safety so one

00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:28,279
of the key things that's happening is

00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:30,259
the real time project in the linux

00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,850
foundation is supposed to be finished

00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:34,190
most of their work by october november

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,080
this year meaning that the real time

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,720
patch will be integrated upstream in the

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,999
linux kernel and we plan to piggyback on

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,999
this where we're going to you definitely

00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:46,639
going to reuse all that capability but

00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:48,409
then there's other things brewing at

00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:50,359
linux foundation there's another project

00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:52,789
called civil infrastructure project and

00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,909
they're working on things like nuclear

00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:59,269
power plants trains things where safety

00:28:55,909 --> 00:29:02,670
is absolutely critical so they have a

00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:03,960
big movement to get linux certified

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,480
so all of these things are coming

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,340
together and so there's a definitely a

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,010
possibility that we'll be forming some

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,410
kind of functional safety group within

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,840
Linux foundation so that we centralize

00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,250
all this work and automotive-grade Linux

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,040
will be one of the benefactors of this

00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:23,130
and will obviously help drive some of

00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,260
this when the in their interim there's a

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,390
need to have some functional safety

00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,270
solutions like I said that our hybrids

00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,980
where we run a GL maybe side by side in

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,470
a virtualized environment with something

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,429
that's already been functional safety

00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,480
certified and that could be a nice

00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:42,210
stopgap measure for the next several

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,190
years until Linux can buy it finally

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,960
reach certain levels of safety

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,150
certifications which by the way I

00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,809
believe is completely achievable it's

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:54,030
the same instruction set it's the same

00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:55,770
even potentially the same compilers it's

00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,110
just a matter of following all of the

00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:00,870
rules needed to get certified doing it

00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,549
in the proper fashion and and

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,500
documenting everything so there's no

00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:07,320
when people say Linux can never achieve

00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,450
functional safety that's that's fun in

00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,190
my book ok we can totally achieve it

00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,500
it's not easy nobody says it's going to

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:16,559
be easy but it's totally achievable and

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,870
now we have several large companies that

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,910
want to back and fund this effort which

00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,240
is important and so I believe we'll get

00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,380
there

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,350
so AGL will be working on this as well

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,730
we're also potentially going to launch a

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,400
content delivery expert group I

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:35,520
mentioned earlier I'm working with

00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:38,130
Amazon music Spotify Comcast in the US

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,809
and there's a desire to create some kind

00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,870
of API for content delivery to the

00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:44,790
vehicle especially for backseat

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,799
entertainment so that's something to be

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:50,280
on the lookout for that we'll be working

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,809
on in the coming months and then finally

00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:57,929
just a shameless plug we are hosting the

00:30:53,809 --> 00:31:01,260
automotive Linux summit June 22 the 22nd

00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:03,540
in Tokyo we're expecting over a thousand

00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,090
attendees last year I think we had 650

00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,760
attendees to just the automotive Linux

00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,980
portion we're expecting over a thousand

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,809
because we're co-located with like I

00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,220
said open source summit Japan so this

00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:17,289
will be a very very large event so

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,880
we would love to see you there it's

00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:21,370
going to be a fantastic event for

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,710
discussing automotive and the future of

00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:28,899
Linux and automotive so that's it for my

00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,269
talk I just want to remind everyone I

00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:33,370
always do this at the end a GL is a code

00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:36,110
first organization it's all about the

00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,850
code so thank you very much

00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:43,080
[Applause]

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:43,080
it can take maybe a few questions

00:31:54,290 --> 00:32:05,060
yeah yeah I have one question about

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:09,930
content delivery do you foresee DRM

00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:13,620
secure video path to keys to be part of

00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:15,900
the yellow part of the platform yeah so

00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,830
far it's been out of scope things like

00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:21,300
secure boot and things like that we

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,300
ensure that we work in those

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,550
environments but it's not part of our

00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:28,140
deliverable right at least really like

00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,760
things like secure boot as far as

00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,920
managing keys and everything so far it's

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,990
been out of scope I was referring to the

00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:38,940
secure video path where or the secure

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:41,850
video sorry protected from Comcast or

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:46,440
Netflix or others yeah a lot of

00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:48,810
implications about being legal in in

00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,190
properly decrypting and rendering the

00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:56,670
video having any loopholes yeah so we've

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:59,370
not addressed that yet but the system

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:01,710
reference system hardware architecture

00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,690
team actually has started writing about

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,850
it in the document I mentioned earlier

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:08,760
and so they're gonna try to address it

00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,350
which will lead to software within a GL

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:18,360
to address it that's my belief

00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:20,520
yeah but we haven't yet yep so I have

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,930
two questions but I'll only ask one okay

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:27,570
so yeah

00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:30,300
my question is about given that you're

00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:32,640
gonna have a huge array of sensors on

00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,810
sure oh yeah I'm gonna say vehicle

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,460
because it might not just be a call

00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,170
right yeah sure AGL will make it into

00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,730
many different types of autonomous

00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:41,610
vehicles oh sure

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:44,450
is there any part of AGL that's getting

00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:47,010
involved with or even trying to drive

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:50,220
open data interchange formats and

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:53,670
particularly archival formats or storage

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,560
formats for sensor data so that we don't

00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,930
end up in a situation where people are

00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,270
always compressing and quantizing sensor

00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,950
data for their framework yeah and then

00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,180
you end up with kind of unusable data

00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,100
that you can't go back in mind later

00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,440
yeah

00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,849
well so are you familiar with the

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,879
advanced IDI

00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:14,669
advanced edge computing consortium nope

00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,940
okay so advanced edge computing

00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:20,760
consortium AECC which is being led by

00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,829
Toyota amongst others they actually gave

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,250
a keynote at our event a few weeks back

00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:27,929
and they specifically want to address

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,069
this so we're we're going to be

00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:30,839
collaborating with those guys because

00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:33,139
they're doing all this edge computing

00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:36,210
massive amounts of data is going to be

00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:39,599
exchanged and and we need we need to

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,220
address it so my answer is no not yet

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:47,010
but we're working on it and we're gonna

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:48,869
be working with a ECC to do it okay one

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:52,139
more question and then we have to cede

00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:55,169
the floor I have one about certifying

00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:58,290
Linux for safety okay given the pace of

00:34:55,169 --> 00:35:00,750
which Linux grows and with all the are

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:04,349
seconded a stable releases which shalt

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:06,569
know are you going to certify one LTS

00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,760
for example and yeah when you have

00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:11,130
security fixes that are back ported on

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,140
on an LTS how do you manage the security

00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,319
fixes versus the baseline that you have

00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:18,359
certified you should come work for us

00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:21,540
no but seriously I know that's exactly

00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:24,089
it we're gonna pick some LTS and then

00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,130
not not change it for years right and

00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,960
that'll be the one by the way when I say

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,670
fortunate little safety certification

00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,930
we're not actually going to be able to

00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,760
do that ourselves because we're not

00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,920
running on the final hardware but we

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,740
will do and produce all the artifacts

00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,470
needed for the car company to go do it

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,060
with their supplier so at least the

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,380
Linux part and the software part and

00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,329
that testing and the reproduce

00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,339
reproducibility and all of the testing

00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:49,050
artifacts we're gonna provide that and

00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:52,230
then it's up to them to go get certified

00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:54,000
on the final hardware not us just to

00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,490
clarify because we're not we're not in

00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,780
the certification game but we need to be

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:02,970
part of the supply chain for it so so

00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:07,050
yeah so we're gonna pick some ltsi

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:09,839
kernel and you know very minimal set of

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,670
functionality and keep in mind this will

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,250
not go into infotainment this will go

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:18,340
into things like instrument cluster and

00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:21,790
you know maybe a dass type of

00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:26,250
applications so it's totally doable it's

00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,250
just a matter of big effort to do it

00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,200
okay thank you very much

00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:40,650
