Session Name: HKG18-301 - Dramatically Accelerate 96Board Software via an FPGA with Integrated Processors
Speaker: Glenn Steiner
Track: LITE


★ Session Summary ★
Key Takeaways: 

With the drive to increase integration, reduce system costs, accelerate performance, and enhance reliability, software developers are discovering the processor they would like to target is simply not fast enough.  This session will help you the system architect or software developer understand how you can architect and develop software on an FPGA integrated processor, and accelerate software code via FPGA accelerators.

Abstract: 
As a software developer, in order to meet system level performance requirements, you may have realized that your next software project will be targeting a processor inside of an FPGA.  How will this impact your development process and what benefits might you gain with this tight integration of processor and FPGA?  Starting from the basics of what FPGAs are (in terms of software programming), this session will provide a simple to understand primer of what modern FPGAs with embedded processors can do.  We will wrap up with examples of how high level synthesis tools can move software to programmable logic hardware enabling dramatic software acceleration.
