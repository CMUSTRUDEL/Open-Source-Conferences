Description: 
	Chiplets are being increasingly used to build multi-chip platforms in order to increase the core count and the compute capacity on a package. Arm’s Neoverse Reference Design implementation provides guidelines to build a quad-chiplet package in which identical compute subsystems are connected through a high speed cache coherent CCIX link.

This talk focuses on the software design for an Arm architecture based CCIX enabled quad-chip platform using open source components such as Arm’s SCP-Firmware, Trusted Firmware, EDK2 and Linux. Various aspects of such a system including design that uses single flash to boot firmware on all four chips, performing cross chip coherent CCIX link setup, multi-chip interrupt routing and power management across the chips are presented. It also talks about the NUMA configuration and multi-chip SMP Linux boot sequence using the standard PSCI/SCMI interface. Details about availability of upstream software that can be reused on Arm based multiple-chip platforms are also presented.
