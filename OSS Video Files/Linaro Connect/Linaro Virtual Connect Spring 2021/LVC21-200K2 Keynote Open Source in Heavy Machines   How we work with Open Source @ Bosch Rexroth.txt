Title: LVC21-200K2 Keynote Open Source in Heavy Machines   How we work with Open Source @ Bosch Rexroth
Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	The success of mobile and smart devices leads to an ever-growing demand of functions and features in yet traditional industries. This is also the case for heavy machinery like agricultural or constructions machines. In the wake of this trend electronic architectures are changing and yet clearly separated and seemingly incompatible industry sectors grow together. Hence, Open Source enables us at Bosch and Bosch Rexroth to learn and develop faster while in parallel keeping and even increasing our product quality.

	00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,560
good morning everybody so

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,000
very warm welcome to my keynote speech

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,639
on open source in heavy machines how we

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,679
work with

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,560
open source at bosch rexroth

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,359
my name is christian graven and i'm

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,480
working with

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,680
bosch rexroth as a business owner

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,400
for connected off highway machines so

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,279
before we

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
jump into this topic i would want to

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,000
give you

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,640
some brief information about the

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
organization that i'm coming from

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,079
and this is bosch rexroth and bosch

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,520
rexroth is

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:43,600
a 100 subsidiary of

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,840
the bosch company so um

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:52,160
bosch company represents roughly 400 000

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,120
associates makes a yearly turnover of

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,680
80 billion euros i guess most of you

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,000
know

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,280
bosch from the automotive sector as

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,640
the number one automotive supplier

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,479
and you're right so automotive segment

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,840
makes roughly 60

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,320
share of sales beyond that there are

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,680
three other business segments and this

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,840
is industrial technology um

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
where i'm coming from and which it

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,840
contains mainly

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,880
bosch rexworth but also energy and

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
building technology and consumer goods

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,759
i guess most of you might also know

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,840
bosch from the consumer goods space

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
for example bosch siemens household

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,840
appliances with the brands bosch

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,400
and siemens of course but also neff and

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,840
others however

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,640
there is also the home improvement

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
branch with power tools you know it from

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,079
the

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:55,040
electric drilling machines or from

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:58,799
gardening technology like lawn mowers

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,479
rexroth itself is representing

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,719
roughly eight percent um from the

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,840
staff perspective from the employees

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,360
perspective with

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,360
30 000 um total staff

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,680
making 6 billion euro total sales and

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,000
being present in more than 80 countries

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,120
with sales and service network

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,440
and manufacturing locations in roughly

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,040
20 countries

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,599
but what does rexross stand for and

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,800
what are the products that retros is

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,920
supplying and

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,160
what industry are we talking about when

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,319
we talk about rexroth or the

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
division or the business unit that i'm

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,800
coming for

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,840
from we are supplying products into

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,080
the off highway segment or into the

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,360
segment of mobile machines as we

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,440
call it so mobile machines are

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,560
those machines that you can see here on

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
the screen

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,159
so those are for example construction

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
machinery like

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,760
reloaders or excavators on the right

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
but also material handling machines like

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,560
cranes

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,879
or forklift trucks but also agricultural

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,000
and forestry machines like tractors

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,959
harvesters and so on

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
so typically we supply hydraulic

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,400
components

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
into those machines which are then used

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,040
to

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840
um propel and actually propel the

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
machines in

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,239
themselves but also or actuate

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
the implements like the boom or bucket

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
of this

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,200
standard excavator beyond the hydraulic

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,840
components

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,599
we talked about a large electronics

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,959
portfolio and now we're getting a little

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,239
bit closer

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,440
to the topic of software on

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,680
open source so our

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,480
portfolio of electronics is called

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
borders

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,720
which stands for bosch rexroth digital

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,200
application solutions

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000
and then we have three pillars so number

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,599
one

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,040
is electronics and hardware electronics

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,200
hardware on the right

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:15,040
so consisting of control units sensors

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,799
hmis like displays or joysticks

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,600
so there's quite some synergy with our

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,040
automotive colleagues especially when it

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,800
comes to sensors

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,360
or control units and in addition to that

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,440
we're also developing software in most

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,759
cases it's standard software but we're

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,880
also doing customized software for our

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
customers

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,960
but this standard software is really

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,560
intended to run

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,320
on different kinds of machines reason is

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,759
that in our industry in our segment

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,400
we have much smaller fleet

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
than compared to the automotive industry

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,520
and

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
we can only leverage on economies of

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,759
scale

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,880
if we do standardization beyond that

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,440
there's our

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,080
third pillar our newest sibling and this

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
is

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,240
our iot and telematics offering which is

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,039
called borders connect

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,880
and which i'm representing today as the

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,000
respective business owner being

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,720
responsible

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,960
for the development but also for the

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,080
commercial part

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,639
now let's dig into that um for some

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,759
minutes

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,560
and have a look at how we use open

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,039
source

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,520
in these kind of iot and telematics

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,520
products

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,720
so here in a nutshell you can see a

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,600
high-level architecture or

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,680
how the data flow from left the

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
applications the machines to

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,520
right to the cloud and to the back end

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
in between

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,880
you see the hardware or the things the

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,000
big t

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,720
in iot and at the center

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
there's our connectivity unit which

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,720
transmits

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
data out of the machine into the data

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,880
management

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,360
backend where data are enhanced where

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,199
data

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,280
are aggregated and visualized

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
below there's the device management

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
which is used

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,960
for managing the electronic units the

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,639
electronic

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,800
connectivity unit or the electronic

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,280
control units or sensors

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,680
now let's have a closer look at those

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,639
two devices

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,919
which are clearly driven by software

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,520
there's a fundamental

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,960
difference if you look at those

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,319
components and

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,840
if you look at the top one this is the

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,319
electronic control unit

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,880
quite similar to the electronic control

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,240
units

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,400
that you know and that you see

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,280
in automotive industry and passenger

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
cars

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,639
so typically nowadays passenger cars

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
we're talking about

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,800
10th if not even hundreds of those

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,160
control units

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,440
which are in most cases powered by

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,759
microcontroller architecture

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,199
so for those microcontroller-based

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,639
devices

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,919
uh you have a

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,560
quite specific tool chain

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,199
so those microcontroller-based devices

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,400
they are

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,680
highly specified highly customized

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,680
they are very efficient but of course

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,800
they are not that versatile

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,440
as microprocessor based devices this

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,960
leads

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,280
to a more proprietary tool chain

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,639
and this also leads to the fact that

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,720
open source

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,680
modules are not that freely available

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,199
like in the other spaces this is

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,759
completely different when you look at

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,720
the microprocessor biased devices

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
like the rexrose connectivity control

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,599
unit

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,319
on at the bottom so here microprocessor

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,800
based

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,800
means in most cases there's an operating

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
system running on top of it in our case

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
it's a linux operating system

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
and of course with linux you already

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,840
know there's a clear relevance for open

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,479
source

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,479
and there are on top of it many open

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,039
source modules available

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,440
and different from the other

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,720
microcontroller based architecture

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,520
you have a large variance of different

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,720
coding languages for example now let's

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,000
have a look at

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,400
the software architecture for our

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,639
telematics control unit our rexworth

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,240
control connectivity unit

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,200
and this is what i've brought here i

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,640
don't want to

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,200
dig too deeply into that i just want to

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,880
show briefly our layered approach with

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,240
the linux operating

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,040
system at the bottom then a hardware

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,440
area communication broker and on top of

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,920
it

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,360
an application layer for this

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,399
application layer

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,600
we're using containerized modules

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:04,000
and there we're relying on linux

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,680
snap technology developed by

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,519
canonical as part of the ubuntu

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,839
distribution linux distribution

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,880
so now let's have a closer look at what

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
kind of

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,760
open source modules we're using for

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,519
example i already talked about linux

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,760
and we're using debian as our distro

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,640
then when it comes to the communication

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,760
broker

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,200
this is based on mqtt and for that

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,920
we're using mosquito interfacing to the

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,880
canvas

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,680
we're using can tools as an open source

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,680
module

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:46,399
and we're building our web front end

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,800
and our web interface on angular

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,120
now as i already mentioned for us it's

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,080
quite important to collaborate with our

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,640
customers and

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,959
to offer our customers the chance to

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,560
develop their own software to develop

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,040
their own

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,079
modules and to collaborate with other

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
partners

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,839
other suppliers for example and for that

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,320
reason

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:13,600
we disclose and distribute for example

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,120
example code as open source

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,160
on our github now

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,560
let me summarize why i believe open

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,040
source is a good idea in our industry

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,079
and a good idea in our segment

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,120
and for that reason i brought our top

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,880
five reasons

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:36,000
to use open source number one

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,560
time to market for us it's important

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,160
that we don't want to reinvent the wheel

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,240
so take what's already available use it

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,160
and this is one of the reasons why we

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,600
built upon a linux

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,399
operating system for example number two

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,959
proven by heavy use and you can directly

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,959
see it

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,720
by the example that i brought with me on

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,760
the top right corner

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,959
that for an instance

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,079
the kernel defect density for

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,760
the linux kernel is lower than

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,560
the industry average this already shows

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,000
that for open source there's a high

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,959
chance that somebody else

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,079
has already found the initial bugs but

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:23,360
because it's so heavily used

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:27,839
the quality is typically much higher

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,360
and this helps of course a

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,880
number three functionality so with

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,760
open source as standard and as such

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,040
in some cases also commodity we can

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,320
completely focus

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,279
on our core competencies and our

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,160
unique selling points so why would we

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,160
want

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,120
to work and develop something that

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,279
everybody else considers as a standard

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,480
and for which nobody wants to pay

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,600
anything

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,639
so this means clearly focusing on the

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,240
differentiating elements

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,480
number four and of course the issue of

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,160
cost has to come here

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,120
and i don't want to say that using open

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,880
source

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,079
means it's not associated to cost and we

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,720
don't need to

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,560
take some money in our hands even if

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
using or when using

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,600
open source of course there are also

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,720
maintenance cost

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,920
but nevertheless just by looking at

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,560
the linux fictive kernel cost

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,120
it's clear it doesn't make sense to

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,279
develop

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,360
something like that from scratch why

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,959
would anybody want to do that and again

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,399
here comes the argument

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,519
of our small fleet and our

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,680
small quantities

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,720
number five and this is about vendor

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,920
lock in

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,440
so this is a quite important argument

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,600
for using open source

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,639
so you can easily benchmark different

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
technologies

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,680
different solutions and then you can

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,160
take the superior one

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,000
this is important for us of course you

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,760
need to have the right competency

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,440
to compare to distinguish and then

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,839
take the right decision and yes i know

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
those are already five

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,279
but nevertheless i brought another one

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,120
with me and this

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,120
i call five plus and this is about cross

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,680
company collaborations

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
i believe open source is really a

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,839
perfect means

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,720
to facilitate this kind of

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,440
collaboration now having talked a lot

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,199
about

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,279
open source and why we using open source

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,399
but there's another topic that i want to

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,440
talk about and

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
from my perspective is closely linked to

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,920
the topic

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,079
of open source and this is inner source

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
so collaboration within the bosch

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,160
organization and as

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
i've already shown with 400 000

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,800
employees

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,079
of course collaboration within the

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
organization is

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,839
already something which is quite

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,880
important

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,920
so let me show you the endeavor that we

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,959
have taken

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,320
within the bosch organization and this

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,880
is about so-called bios bosch

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,360
internal open source this was started

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,160
2009 as an experiment and as a proof of

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,240
concept

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,760
to generate first learnings in 2013 then

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,000
we extended this and we created bios

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,519
as a new development approach 2016 was

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,720
then the starting point

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:45,040
of an extension and

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,519
branching so still bios

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,560
was and is the gold standard but we

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,399
realized

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:56,240
that by making use of the tool chain

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:59,279
of this bios approach this is something

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
which a lot of our developers could

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,440
benefit from

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,160
and this was the starting point of our

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,199
social coding platform

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,279
as some kind of tool chain also for

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:17,040
non-bios developments nowadays we focus

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,639
on decentralization the facilitation

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,440
so not only having a central team

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,800
focusing on our buyers activities and

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,759
further improve

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:32,320
our bios legal framework around it

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,279
in order to give you some idea how we

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,480
work with

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:40,959
bios and how this is used within our

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:44,160
organization i brought some statistics

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:54,240
this is about how frequently

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:57,360
um social coding be it buyers or even

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,240
non-bios is 13 000 users

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:05,680
and in total this means

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,160
20 000 repositories with

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:13,839
15 share of bios projects

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:18,079
within these projects

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:21,759
within these social coding projects

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:25,680
and in most cases it is like that

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:29,199
that developers or projects start

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,839
with non-bios projects so they want to

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,800
get

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,000
a first idea they try it out they try

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,279
out the social coding platform

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,560
and they are using closed projects but

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:46,000
starting from that they realize

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,199
that they realize how powerful

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,079
this bios approach is especially when it

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,560
comes to

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,519
collaboration between units

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,920
organizational units business units

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,440
when it comes to collaboration across

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,040
border

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,880
and then um they start going into

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,280
the bios region

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,679
this is also what we did with our

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,480
developments with our project

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,600
and we also started as close project and

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,880
then we realized

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,839
how beneficial it is to use this

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,839
bios approach

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,440
in this slide now i want to show you

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
um some network diagrams and

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,840
what you can see on the left is

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,280
basically

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,640
the network of social coding

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,200
so the different colors represent

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,080
different

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,000
organizational units so each color

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,720
stands for one organizational

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,080
unit and the lines represent the

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,840
collaboration between different units

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,039
the closer the units are and the closer

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,080
the individual

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,320
organizations are this means that the

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,960
closer the organizational units are

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,360
from a business perspective and from an

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,240
organizational perspective

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,640
the more remote they are located here on

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,320
this

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,760
frame the more remote they are also

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,640
located from a business perspective

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,559
on the right now you can see this green

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,679
organizational unit how this

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,160
collaborates

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,520
throughout the whole um bosch

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,280
organization

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,440
and you can see it's not only

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,000
collaborating with very

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,840
close organizations or which are in

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,799
their direct vicinity
