Title: LVC21-116 Physical Attack Mitigation
Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	Give an overview of physical attacks and how can they be applied to compromise system security (bypass secure boot or the configuration of memory isolation hardware elements). Introduce software countermeasures against physical attacks to mitigate them. Show in practice how these countermeasures are implemented in MCUboot project and TF-M runtime. Talk about the challenges and solutions of implementing these countermeasures in open-source projects. Introduce a QEMU based test environment which meant to simulate the effects of physical attacks on software execution.
