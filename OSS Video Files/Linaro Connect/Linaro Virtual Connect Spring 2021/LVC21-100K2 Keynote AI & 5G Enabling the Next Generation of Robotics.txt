	00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,919
greetings of the day i know a lot of

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,160
people have joined

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,480
from a lot of different parts of the

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,000
world uh uk us

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,040
so thank you for joining uh my name is

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,280
dev singh

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,039
i lead the robotics drones and

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,199
intelligent machines business

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,560
at qualcomm today we'll discuss about

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,560
the newer technologies like 5g and ai

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,320
how they are going to shape the future

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,320
of the next generation

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,920
of robotics and intelligent machines

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:40,800
so welcome and thank you for joining

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:44,559
so i can uh i'm very positive that

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,280
everybody here knows about qualcomm

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,160
and uh but again i'll give a benefit of

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
doubt

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,760
so qualcomm is at the forefront of

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,800
innovation for over 30 years

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,800
we pay a lot of attention to r d and

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,840
a new technology development so we spend

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,119
oh five billion dollars year and year

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
cumulatively so far we've spent 64

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,360
billion dollars

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,479
on r d alone that results in great

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,920
technology

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,600
and uh and things like the patents

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,520
uh we have over 130 000 patents

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,200
um that that that is a anecdote of

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,479
all the technology that we've developed

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,880
so qualcomm has been changing

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,720
how the world communicates computes

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,520
and the technology leadership that we've

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,600
had over 30 plus years

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,720
is enabling all of that we have defined

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,759
and the mobile communication we've

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,119
digitized it

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,399
we've defined computing both

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
desktop and smartphones as well and here

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,640
we are now

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,640
with 5g and ai transforming

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
industries connecting virtually

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
everything

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,239
so we are enhancing everyday life

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,119
uh qualcomm technology touches all

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,160
aspects of

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,680
of humanity

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,319
and within qualcomm robotics is a big

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
division

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,520
that's the division i lead we are one of

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,920
the few semiconductor companies

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,760
that are only one probably can claim

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,400
that we have a specific division

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,800
for robotics where we have software

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,879
hardware systems engineers

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,840
day in and day out their main job is to

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,440
focus on robotics

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,160
part of our charter is to edu to address

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,280
diverse

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,760
robotics challenges we are in

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
different kind of robots uh home care

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,519
robots

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,040
delivery robots warehouse logistics

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:57,360
agriculture manufacturing you name it

00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:01,120
and we are uh in most of the robots

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,360
and the proof is in pudding uh

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,040
the we have launched numerous robotics

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,239
products here you see

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,720
uh names like irobot sony

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,440
softbanks skydio drones brain

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
corporation

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,440
it goes on and on uh we put

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,560
millions of robots commercially deployed

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,560
with qualcomm

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,000
technology there so we are putting

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,959
uh robots in people's homes to clean

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,840
floors

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,280
uh putting robots in factories and

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,760
enterprises

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
at the same time in the same breath i

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,640
can say that

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,840
we have robots in outer space

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,360
uh the next slide is coming up

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,799
uh we we've been partnering with nasa in

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,319
jpl

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,760
and part of that has resulted in

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:59,280
a collaboration with

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,000
nasa and jpl on the perseverance mission

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,519
so part of the mission that we have with

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,239
nasa and jpl

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
be proud to be part of the ingenuity

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,879
mission

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,799
and for those who know about it

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,120
of course it is uh it is

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,359
game changing technology the first time

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,880
ever there will be a

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:26,160
a flight that's going to be happening on

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,000
mars which is defining how space

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,919
exploration happens

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,520
so unfortunately because of technical

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,320
glitch you were not able to see the cool

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,880
video

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,639
i'll try to see if we can go back but in

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,639
interest of time

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,840
i'll i'll keep going but yeah this is a

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,880
very uh momentous moment for humanity

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,080
and science

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,800
where snapdragon processor is on mars

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,280
with powering the whole helicopter which

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,600
runs

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,080
on on on the snapdragon flight platform

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,560
and for those who are following it uh

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,199
just quick update over the weekend

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
the perseverance is preparing for the

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,039
deployment

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,759
of the infinity helicopter it's dropped

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,880
the

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,440
debris shield that means within few days

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,039
now

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,360
anytime it's going to drop the

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,160
helicopter down uh place it down

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,520
and we'll have the first flight so it's

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
going to be a true

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,600
wright brothers movement for the

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
universe 150 years ago

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
on planet earth we had a wright brothers

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
movement which

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
defined how we travel how we uh

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,360
how logistics are done now that's going

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,320
to happen in space and

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,720
mars as well and all of this we are very

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,639
humblingly pride of proud of

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,639
is based on qualcomm technology

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,720
so let's today what we want to talk

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,160
about

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,240
is the technology that we are working on

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
which is fueling tomorrow's robotics

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,479
innovations

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
namely um things that i want to touch

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,759
upon

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,520
is the heterogeneous computing

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,840
distributed intelligence

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,000
and 5g connectivity

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,240
so again the future is

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
bright if you're a more you'll see a lot

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
of robotics

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,880
and iot devices out there and we've

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
pioneered the technology that's powering

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,319
this future

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,639
when it comes to connectivity from

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,880
anything from load power bluetooth to 5g

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,280
and

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,960
everything in between qualcomm has

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,280
pioneered those technologies

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
in terms of processing we have cutting

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,479
edge

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,199
snapdragon qualcomm technology

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,639
processors

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
that have the best computing

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,440
capabilities which we'll touch upon

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,240
in uh upcoming slides

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,960
so the first piece i want to emphasize

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,720
on

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
which is a fundamental building block

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,520
for

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,120
any technology or product development

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,880
is the compute and it's not any compute

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,280
and that's where i think developers have

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,720
gotten it wrong over the years

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,400
is they pick off the shelf gpu cpus

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,919
to do uh all kind of complex uh

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,840
tasks but the key here is to

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,240
use different types of processing

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,599
engines for

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,479
different computing needs every

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,199
processing

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,039
engine has its own specialization so you

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,639
need to assign the right task to the

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,240
right engine for the best

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,319
optimum efficiency and output

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,880
so for example if you have a sequence

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,280
control kind of algorithms

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
uh or uh use case you would want to use

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,720
cpu

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,520
you have computer vision you want to use

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,639
a dedicated hardware for computer vision

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,160
uh you want to use ai

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,800
yeah there's a lot of different ways

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,520
people are using gpus and others but we

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,240
think

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
a dedicated needle processing unit is

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,599
the way to go

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,879
when it comes to a heterogeneous compute

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,960
platform

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,560
so heterogeneous compute even though

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,800
it's not talked about much

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,360
is a fundamental building block and that

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,479
needs to be paid attention to

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,360
at qualcomm we have processors that have

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,160
this

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,759
like if you all call it as a swiss knife

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,720
you have the right

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,840
tool for the right application and

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
that's what

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,759
heterogeneous compute is about and one

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,680
of those

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,199
examples i can give about heterogeneous

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,479
compute is the cv

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,680
isp that we built a hardware

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
accelerator on the chip to do computer

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,320
vision

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,320
so in past people use isp

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,399
and ran computer vision algorithms on

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,000
cpus and gpus

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,160
well that works but is it efficient when

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,440
right here when you use a dedicated

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,160
hardware accelerator

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
for computer vision for things like

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,360
object classification

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,360
slam six darf depth sensing etc

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
you get extreme boost because it's a

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,920
dedicated

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,800
hardware accelerator at the same time

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,720
you get a lot of power savings so um

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,760
it's no brainer that you need to use the

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,320
right tool

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,399
uh to make your life easier so

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,519
definitely that's heterogeneous compute

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,480
i want to underscore the need of that uh

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,640
moving on the next technology i think

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,920
fundamentally that is coming together

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,320
is on device intelligence we've talked

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,320
about

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,600
ai everybody's aware of ai

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
but when we talk about ai today people

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,640
think about

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,399
central cloud but as devices get more

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,320
and more smarter

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,600
we we are seeing there's a lot of

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,279
momentum for on device intelligence

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,800
the attach rate for on device

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:56,080
intelligence in 2018 2019 around was 10

00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,080
but it's quickly going to be 100

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,839
attached by 2025 which is significant

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,560
and we'll talk about why on device ai is

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,839
important it is

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,240
not only important it is paramount

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,200
just an example or anecdote right there

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,680
is the mars helicopter right

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,399
it needs to be able to do things

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,920
perceive

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:23,120
reason act autonomously

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,120
do path planning obstacle avoidance

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
right then and there there is no cloud

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,680
there's no edge there's nothing

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
so the device has to be smart enough to

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,760
have lot of

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
intelligence so on device ai is

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,720
paramount

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,920
privacy reliability immediacy efficiency

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,279
and personalization

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,480
these are key reasons for robotics and

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:50,160
iot devices to have

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,160
on device intelligence of course

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
and when we talk about undivided

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,839
intelligence

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,760
it doesn't mean that it's easy solution

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,399
or easy problem to solve

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,279
there's a lot of inherent challenges of

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,760
ai workloads which are compute intensive

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,279
uh which are large complicated models

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,000
but at the same time

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,560
the device have constraints such as a

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,920
robot

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,600
or a handheld device would require

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,040
which will be battery operated so you

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
need to be worrying about

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,200
lot of things like storage memory

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,680
thermal efficiency

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,480
so power and thermal efficiency is

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,920
critical

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,839
for the promise of this 100 detached

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,880
of connected devices so

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,760
at qualcomm not only we

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,959
are championing the on device ai but we

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,880
are making it

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,600
power efficient for the reasons we

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,800
talked about in the previous slide

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,800
make it more power efficient and more ai

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
using right hardware like we discussed

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
about

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,760
heterogeneous compute that's the

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,399
building block you select the right

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,839
compute

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,160
task to get the optimization

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,200
and thermal efficiency so when you're

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,040
doing ai

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,720
you're doing it on neural processing

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,040
engine with

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,320
advanced algorithms that are state of

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,760
art networks

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,880
and and uh optimized to

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,000
run on energy efficient at the same time

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,800
having a full software toolset to make

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
it happen

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,440
so at qualcomm our r d is focused

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,480
on making edge uh edge ai

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,480
and on devices ai very very

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,279
pervasive so our approach

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,480
for ai is by having the right hardware

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,360
that we do

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,600
uh having the right hardware blocks be

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,839
it

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,839
socs or even server cards

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
frameworks or operating system

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,279
ecosystems this is an

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,600
end-to-end system problem and a company

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,519
like qualcomm that is an engineering

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,360
uh systems engineering company at heart

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
believes in an end-to-end system

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,079
solution and we are focused on all these

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,040
areas

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,560
so ai is definitely definitely important

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,760
and it is

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,680
opening up a lot of new

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
applications on a daily basis

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,720
so from ai we move to 5g

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,880
and we'll see how this all come together

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,320
but again 5g is another piece of

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,800
technology

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,519
that is outstandingly uh amazing

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,279
because of the reasons of uh it not

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,639
being just a mobile technology

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:44,000
we'll cover that but 5g is here here

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:48,880
2019 was year of 5g deployment

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
uh 2020 was rollout 2021 is expansion

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,480
so we are going to see 5g moving into a

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,519
lot of

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,000
areas beyond mobile broadband so people

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,360
think

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,480
5g as a next mobile technology

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,519
but it's far beyond that it

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,240
uh it it build on this fundamental three

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,320
pillars

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,399
mission critical services enhanced

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,360
mobile broadband and massive internet of

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,760
things

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,880
all of these have their own requirements

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,320
and challenges

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,880
and 5g is built to handle those kind of

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,880
challenges

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,880
and like i mentioned 5g is going to be

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,360
phenomenal

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,079
it is going to help grow the ecosystem

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,040
across

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,839
industries across segments based on the

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,959
reports

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,320
over 12 trillion dollars of digital

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,680
economic output

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,199
is going to be uh enabled

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:47,040
by 5g by year 2035

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,959
which is massive which is really massive

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,360
and why 5g is important for

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,600
applications beyond mobile for example

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,320
in mission critical activities

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,600
5g comes with a lot of bells and

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,279
whistles that

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,120
are features that are needed for

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,000
industrial iot

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,760
for example a feature like ultra

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
reliable low latency

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,120
so you have ultra low latency of sub

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,160
millisecond

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,959
end-to-end latency but at the same time

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,040
the reliability that is needed is also

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,399
achieved and availability too

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,680
so for factories and

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,920
autonomous vehicles and robotics

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,120
this kind of technology is

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,240
ground-breaking

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,440
it's going to assure new use cases

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,600
and change how robots behave in

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
factories etc

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,199
so there's cool features that coming

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,399
together on five

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,600
5g as well but we discussed about ai

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,959
and we discussed about 5g independently

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,720
these two technologies are powerhouses

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:58,560
they are like we discussed

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,920
uh enabling new economic streams

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,279
and generating uh new industries uh

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,880
and enabling new industries but when

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,680
5g and ai come together magic happens

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,240
so that's the age of 5g and ai where you

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,120
will see

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,759
a lot of we discuss about on device ai

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
but edge is going to be very important

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,759
as well

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,240
think of a scenario of a private factory

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,279
where

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,560
you need a lot of robots but at the same

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,040
time

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,399
because you need more compute and

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,880
there's no option of cloud

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,079
you need edge cloud which means on

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,240
premises

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:43,040
uh compute more than on device as well

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,399
so to be able to have scalability

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,959
robustness

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
big data analytics you need a lot more

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,320
compute

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,120
than on the device as well so on device

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,959
is important

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,079
but edge cloud is also important and 5g

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,199
is going to enable that that

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,240
that connection between the device

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,439
and 5g but the true

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,679
expansion that's going to happen is

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,880
with the concept of distributed

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,679
intelligence

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,760
with ai and 5g coming together

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,240
seamlessly connecting the device

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,520
to the edge and the edge to the cloud

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,559
central cloud

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,520
this is the concept of the distributed

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,079
intelligence paradigm which is required

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,120
for

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,360
a massive iot expansion and that's going

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
to

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,400
be happening because of these two

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,799
technologies

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
uh coming together and this is just

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,880
going to have

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,000
a tremendous impact tidal wave of iot

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,679
expansion

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,559
43 billion connected devices by 2023

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
itself it's going to touch every aspect

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,880
of our life

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,760
so these technologies are really

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,480
powerful

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,200
they are going to be applicable in all

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,080
kind of

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,679
scenarios enabling smart warehouses for

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,480
example

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,160
if you think about lights out

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,440
fulfillment center

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,679
5g robotics ai coming together

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,160
is going to make that happen if you

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,160
think about

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,320
industry industrial industry 4.0 or

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,559
factory

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,919
of the future which is smart

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,760
manufacturing

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,320
is made possible with 5g and with

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,080
edge ai as well where you have private

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,080
5g networks and

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,000
great reliability and latencies that we

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,000
talked about

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,520
so you can imagine the future of

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
flexible manufacturing

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,600
which means reconfigurable factories and

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,960
that's again the power of 5g and ai

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,640
i can go on and on uh things like remote

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,320
mining operations

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,679
things like port facilities things like

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,640
utilities grid operations

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,840
oil and gas offshore onshore all of

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,200
these industries

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,200
are going to be tremendously

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,960
uplifted with the use cases that 5g and

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,960
ai are going to bring together

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,600
so with all of this uh we've discussed

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,559
the technologies but with all of this in

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,440
mind

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,320
qualcomm is not only great putting great

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,679
technology

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,760
r d investment but we are

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,520
commercializing great

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,520
uh platforms and we launched the first

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,559
world's first 5g and ai robotics

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,480
platform

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:35,600
earlier uh last year and it's been a

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,720
tremendous uh tremendous

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
thing uh it's it's one of those products

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,840
that

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,600
not only brings the technology together

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,520
but we have built

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,039
it as a purpose-built robotics

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,280
development kit

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,600
so for the community what it means is

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,039
you don't just get the ai and 5g

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,840
chip you get a robotic development kit

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,280
that comes with pre-integrated sensors

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,120
pre-integrated vision

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,960
cameras depth cameras motor control

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,159
mezzanines that are there we'll talk

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,919
about the mezzanines

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,400
uh in a bit but this is all uh

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,120
the power of putting everything together

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,919
as a development kit

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,960
and of course we have uh ways to make it

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
quick prototype

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,440
at the same time be able to have

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,080
different commercialization choices as

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,080
well

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,760
for industrial applications we have

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,480
ethernet ethercat

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,520
you name it this is kitchen sink for any

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,640
kind of robotic application i would say

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,840
and not only that

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,919
we have been launching this product

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,440
it's being recognized heavily by the

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,480
industry as well

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,039
the last two years ago in 2019 we

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
launched

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,640
the rb3 robotics platform you guys will

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
be

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,320
very much aware of that and we'll cover

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,039
that in the next slide as well

00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,200
but that won the robotics innovation

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:04,880
award for ai at the global expo in 2019

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,320
then it was also ranked as the top 10

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,360
linux single board computers in 2019

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,320
and now with rb5 uh the

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,960
uh silicon valley robotics recognizes as

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,600
a

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,960
industry award for good robot uh

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,200
processing power

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,360
and the ai and 5g coming together so

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,799
it's gaining a lot of

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,440
visibility and recognition as well

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,080
but at the same time we have been

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,120
putting a lot

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,000
of work in collaborations there's

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,159
a lot of fruitful collaboration that's

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,240
happening especially with lenaro

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,760
we started this journey with linaro in

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,200
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,919
we uh we started working with linaro we

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,240
launched the dragon board 410c the

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,320
dragon boat 820 c

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,600
and this rb3 and rb5 platform are also

00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,919
in association with lenaro this

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:04,159
follows the 96 board compatible design

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
and that's where we have this lego kind

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,039
of hardware

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,679
which has the processor the mezzanine

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,880
cards

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,320
and everything to go with it so this is

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
and you will see many more rbx platforms

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,799
in future

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,880
i don't want to spoil the teasers

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,520
but stay tuned you will be hearing more

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,640
about future rb access as well

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,280
in collaboration with linaro and

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,320
linaro has been great they've been

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,120
working with us very closely

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,679
we have leveraged the 96 board consumer

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,799
edition

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,000
for the mezzanine design lenaro provides

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,200
and maintains linux bsps for the

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,679
upstream version

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,240
um for these robotics platforms and

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,760
and there's a big developer lenaro

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,559
developer community

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,520
working on these qualcomm technology

00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,520
platforms as well

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,120
and we talked about the hardware

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,360
being a lego format because it's

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,480
specifically in the 96 board compatible

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,320
design where

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,960
you can pick and choose the mezzanines

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,000
you want similarly our software

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,200
architecture is also has a similar

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
architecture

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,559
where you have of course the hardware

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,240
that we talked about which is

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,240
heterogeneous compute

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,960
you have all these processing blocks

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,320
cameras the dsps and the

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,640
ai engines and then on top

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,679
in the middle where you have this sdks

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,240
or the modules

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,400
which are the multimedia subsystem the

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,360
robotic vision module the robotics

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,120
navigation

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,760
and ai all of part of it and on the user

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,559
space

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,000
for developer community we make this so

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,120
easy with

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,559
sensor nodes as ros nodes and you have

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,559
ros applications

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,240
and you have open source applications

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,960
you can do your own

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,400
uh slam kind of applications when you

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,279
want to use fast cv

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
you have it when you use g streamer in

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,640
combination with

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,600
open source application or a ros

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,960
application

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,039
you can pick and choose so uh

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,320
the software architecture also goes with

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,840
the same thought process

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,240
of the 96 board community

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,039
approach of the lego format so that's

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,640
where we are

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,400
at um in addition to having

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,559
the rbx in linaro community

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
we also have a qualcomm developer

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,120
network

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,440
which has a multiple

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,440
ecosystem it's a member directory

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,799
qualcomm advantage network

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,840
where we have uh uh

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,039
development kits along with

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,039
uh projects so

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:58,159
in on github we have a few uh

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,960
a few uh uh codes

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,159
access to codes as well on github etc so

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,120
there's a lot going on

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,840
uh beyond uh just having the platforms

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,480
out there

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,480
we have community and others so with all

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
of this what we are doing is

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,320
enabling the development and make maker

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,480
community with

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,919
putting the brains of smartphones in the

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,200
innovative hands

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:24,320
to with key technologies

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,279
so i know there are few questions but i

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,840
have

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,960
this was one of my last slides where i

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,440
want to wrap up by

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,320
talking about the qualcomm philosophy

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,440
and approach

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,400
is an end-to-end system solution

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,720
approach

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,919
we have great chipsets we have a roadmap

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,039
of good better best

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,279
we can uh address a 200

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,600
toy robot needs and a two million dollar

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,080
factory robot needs we have that

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,720
breadth of the portfolio and we have the

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,200
software

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,919
and the tools to go with it uh like the

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,720
sdks

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,400
we have the hardware platforms ecosystem

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,919
support

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,559
and all of it so with the r d

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,440
innovation and everything that we have

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,679
been doing

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,279
which is laying the foundation with the

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,919
5g and ai

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,919
technology leadership advanced silicon

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,559
that we are putting out there

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,480
with the ecosystem investment we are

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,240
uniquely positioned to power the next

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,520
generation of connected machines

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,799
devices robots you name it so with that

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,679
um i'll thank you so much

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,799
i'll take some questions i guess they're

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,799
in the chat window here

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,360
i do have trouble with the speaker so

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,360
looks like uh

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,799
yes so the first question is where is

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,960
the place to ask the questions uh

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,080
they're in the developer network at the

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,520
same time

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,960
uh lenaro community also can answer

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,080
those questions about the hardened

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,480
processors we can

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,400
we can talk about it but we'll be happy

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,080
to take your questions on the developer

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,080
network

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:15,600
um did you need a red hardening for

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,919
mars actually uh that's the beauty about

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,120
it

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,080
we did not uh this was off-the-shelf

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,279
device

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,960
off-the-shelf product and um

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,480
among a lot of other processors that

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,279
were compared or

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,960
talked about for this mission qualcomm

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,919
was one of those ones that

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,120
was able to withstand the radiations and

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,440
the gravitational

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,480
requirements and g-forces it did not

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
disintegrate

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,480
we had done nothing for it to harden it

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,039
it is off the shelf

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,320
and we are all pleasantly uh happy and

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,880
surprised

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,799
not surprised but happy that the rigor

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,320
that we put into our products

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,640
is uh is going into uh these kind of

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,799
applications

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,720
support for eyes so next question is

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,399
support for isp for computer vision is

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
really interesting how can i know more

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,120
about this platform

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,919
um great again qualcomm developer

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,200
network

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,480
has all all the all the uh

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,960
details if you can i will type my

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,360
email right here and when you get a

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,960
chance if you want to

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,559
send me a note that will also work

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,559
i can connect you to the right people

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,679
and uh i think

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,120
so most of the questions are around mars

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,480
hardening i'm sure

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,760
uh nasa jpl has done a lot of system

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,480
level hardening but at the

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
at the processor level software level it

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,360
is

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,440
uh out of the box uh off the shelf

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,840
what's the purpose of rb3 and rb5

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,600
platforms the purpose of rb3 and rb5

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,559
platforms are for the developer

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,080
community

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,440
to be able to accelerate the development

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,840
for robotics time to market

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,360
and meet all the different challenges of

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,360
robotics

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,960
i think those are the questions that we

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,240
had here

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,679
um with that

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,919
i guess i will take leave thank you so

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,919
much

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,240
and please don't hesitate to contact me

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
