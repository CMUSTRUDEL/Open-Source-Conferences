Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	Technology is becoming more intelligent and available to us wherever we go. This will bring tremendous benefits for everything from entertainment to healthcare. But, as we work towards building this world of pervasive, collaborative intelligence, we must address several key challenges. Our clouds and data centers must evolve to support the demands of machine learning. Our devices must work together in new ways to inform and support our lives. And, we must protect our privacy, security, and values.

hi

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
i'm brian chai chief strategy officer at

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,240
huawei

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,000
and welcome to building the future of

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,920
pervasive ubiquitous

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,400
collaborative intelligence with arm and

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:19,119
open source

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,720
so a lot of us have been stuck at home

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,199
pretty much this whole past year

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,199
and this has been one of the big driving

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,359
factors that's really accelerated

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,519
the adoption of digital technologies

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,599
into everything that we've been doing

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,600
and i think you know as we start to

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,320
experience this digital transformation

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
around us

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,239
uh taking a look at uh the internet of

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
things as well as you know ai

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,280
capabilities has been one of the most

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
obvious ways that uh all these new

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
digital technologies are

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,559
impacting us especially at home and also

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,640
in all of our environments around us if

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,480
you look at the growth of devices now

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
this has been on a pretty steady state

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,359
uh growth from 2015

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
up until last year but starting from

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,320
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,560
uh up to 2025 uh most people accept

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,320
expect an explosive growth in the number

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,520
of devices that people are going to be

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,360
connecting to

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,439
all around their environments and all

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
around the world and it's not just the

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,439
fiscal

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,880
devices that people are going to be

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,280
interacting with there's going to be a

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,360
whole new range of digital services

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,560
running in the cloud and in the edge

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,640
environments around

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
that are connecting and powering all

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,720
these things around them

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,759
and so as we think about how do we get

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,000
to this new world

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,439
where we have an explosive growth and

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
the number of devices

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,960
that people are interacting with when we

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,479
have an explosive growth in the number

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,240
of network connections uh

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,079
dealing with all these different things

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,320
as well as in the computing power

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,759
required to power all these things where

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,759
is all this leading to

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,000
so i'd like to take a few minutes uh

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,479
during this keynote just to share with

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,560
you

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,399
a little bit in terms of how we at

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
huawei envision

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,479
this future and uh the possibilities

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,399
that it's going to enable

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,320
as well as how we are starting to go

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
about in building this

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,640
in an open way with the rest of the

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,440
industry so i'd first like to start

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,440
just with a brief introduction about

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
what this future might look like and so

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,319
i'd like to share with you uh this a

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,800
brief video i just

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,160
uh go over a little bit in terms of what

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,840
we think this future

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,030
might look like as we go into this new

00:02:20,840 --> 00:03:14,669
world

00:02:22,030 --> 00:03:14,669
[Music]

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,400
so i hope you all agree with me that uh

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,560
you know we really believe that

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
uh using technology to be able to

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
improve our lives especially in

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
important scenarios like health is

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,519
something that's

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,760
really critical and really valuable that

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,400
we can all uh you know usher in

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,120
with this new wave of technologies the

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,319
problem though

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,080
is that even with the most

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,760
state-of-the-art things we have around

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
our smartphones with our you know

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
different smart devices around our homes

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
with our environments with all the ai

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,959
powered cloud services

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,400
there's still a lot of very fundamental

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,000
challenges that we have from the

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,680
industry today that prevent

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
you know something like the scenario

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
that we showed with philip

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,640
in the example i just showed to you

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,319
now what is it that is preventing us

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
from being able to have you know such a

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,040
smart home

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,879
you know connected to such as range of

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,400
smart health services that

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,159
really improve our lives from a

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,319
day-to-day standpoint

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,080
i think there's a few uh key challenges

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,440
that we're all facing from a technology

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,519
standpoint first off we're all

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,280
facing different technology silos as we

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,560
work together when you think about the

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,560
range of things that have to

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
cooperate within an environment like

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,720
that you know from our phones to

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
different

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,639
uh you know sparse speakers uh to

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,800
different cameras uh to different cloud

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,680
services uh and health services that we

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,280
interact with

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,199
uh to different you know networking

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
routers and different devices

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,320
these are all typically uh from

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,160
different vendors uh they're from

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,400
different ecosystems

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,320
and they don't work together very well

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
even when they are from the same vendors

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,919
it's often very

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,199
hard to be able to unify them across

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,280
these very very different

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,759
uh and complicated scenarios where we

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,479
have uh sort of emergent activities that

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,800
work across

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,000
every single one of them another big

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
challenge is that

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,199
you know not all the different devices

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,199
have the same size

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
ecosystems because they have different

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,479
adoption rates

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
everyone of course you know pretty much

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,080
has a smartphone these days

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,520
but how many of you have a smart camera

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,600
system you know deployed

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,039
pervasively around your home or how many

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,720
of you have smart wearables

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,479
whether you know it's a watch or some

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
other fitness device

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,800
and when you think about you know having

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,000
the right individual applications for

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,880
all these different

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,479
devices you know these have different

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,639
market sizes and so there's

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,560
very different developer ecosystems that

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
emerge from all these

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
and so we see that you know these are

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
very fragmented

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
technologies uh silos but they're very

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
fragmented

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,199
developer ecosystems and it's not just

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
from a device standpoint it's

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,080
also when we think about from a cloud

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,919
and from an ai standpoint as well

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,520
for example when you think about you

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,440
know all the range of intelligent

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,680
capabilities that have to power both

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,800
the devices as well as the cloud

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,880
services and

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
uh our homes as well as in the data

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,479
centers that are backing these

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,479
uh it's extremely expensive and

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,120
extremely energy intensive to be able to

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,919
power

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
this range of capabilities and so you

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
know right now uh there's not that many

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,080
enterprises in the world that can start

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
to

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
uh develop and to be able to train and

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,759
to be able to you know provide

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,000
all the things that are necessary to

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,960
enable the intelligent interactions uh

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,639
that we just saw simultaneously when you

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,160
think about the different form factors

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,919
that we have to put all these ai

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
capabilities into you know whether it's

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,520
a fitness device or

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,720
into a laptop or into our phone or in

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,479
the cloud itself

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,560
this is a huge range of different you

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,560
know computing power that we have to run

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,319
intelligent capabilities across

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
and so this is a big challenge how do we

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
scale ai up

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
and how do we scale ai down in order to

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
be able to run

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,400
across all these different environments

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
and all these different form factors

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
it's a very heterogeneous environment

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
that we have to run across

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
and finally uh and perhaps most

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,199
importantly you know

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,720
we have to think about you know both the

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,800
communication

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,479
between all these devices as well as the

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
sensitivity of the data

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,080
between these devices that we want to

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
transfer and when we're dealing with you

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,400
know critical health information

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,400
across you know fitness devices around

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,199
health wearables around you know sensors

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,120
in our home

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,639
we don't want to be constantly streaming

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,039
all this data back and forth

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,240
into the cloud this is both from a data

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,319
privacy standpoint

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
and just from a pure no architecture and

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,560
efficiency standpoint you know to be

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,120
able to

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
transfer all that data across all these

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
devices uh

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,360
into the cloud is extremely difficult

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,039
and also extremely privacy invasive

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
and so how do we start to build a

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,599
fundamentally better approach to be able

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
to

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,680
coordinate and support you know these

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,479
diverse ecosystems this heterogeneous

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,240
environment

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,560
as well as a lot of these you know data

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
issues

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,240
in order to address these uh we think

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
that there's a few fundamental things

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
that we need to change in the overall

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,840
industry

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,440
first off we need a brand new set of

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,280
lightweight infrastructure you know from

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
our devices all the way to the cloud

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,800
backend

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,680
that is able to scale our ai up and our

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,319
ai down

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,759
into all these different environments we

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,360
also need a new way to be able to

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,440
achieve interoperability

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,360
across our devices as well as between

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
the devices and the cloud and the edge

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,360
ecosystem

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,560
we also need to be able to enable

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,400
developers to be able to write

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,160
applications that easily span

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,080
across all these different environments

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,199
you know from different form factors of

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,039
different devices

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,599
all the way out to you know different

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,360
you know uh cloud and ai systems running

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,039
in the cloud and in the edge

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
and this is a huge huge range of

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,680
different technologies that we have to

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,519
work across

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,440
so in order to power that we really

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,440
believe that open source is really the

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,680
best and probably the only way

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,399
to be able to drive the innovation and

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,160
the open ecosystem that is necessary

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,560
in order to bring all these things to

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,279
life using the power of open source we

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,040
can start to create a unified ecosystem

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,880
that spans across all these different

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,760
devices and all these different

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,760
environments

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,160
and so what we want to do is to be able

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,760
to enable this new kind of environment

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,240
where developers can start to think

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,920
about how do i start to write to these

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
different scenarios you know for example

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,600
maybe a health care scenario

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,040
where i can really improve people's uh

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,880
you know environments

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,880
and improve people's lives and i can

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
work across all the range of devices

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
they may interact with

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,160
in all the ranges of cloud services that

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,880
they may need to work across

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,640
and using that open source ecosystem how

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
do i start to then take advantage of all

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,920
the different hardware platforms and

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,959
data systems you know whether it's arm

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,200
architectures

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,480
uh or you know data security and privacy

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,680
between the cloud and the different

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,440
devices

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,279
and so this is the kind of

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,360
transformation that we really think

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,320
has to happen in the industry as we

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,880
start to bring these

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,959
kinds of scenarios to life and so this

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,959
is very much what we've been focused

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,120
at huawei in terms of how do we start to

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,240
deliver these capabilities

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,120
and we really see this as building out

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,040
you know sort of twin capabilities first

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,279
we need to focus on how do we start to

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,920
create a new kind of distributed device

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,839
ecosystem that can work across all these

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,360
ranges of different scenarios

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,200
and environments that people interact

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,640
with and all the different hardware form

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,320
factors they'll interact with from a

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,720
device standpoint

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,480
simultaneously we also need to support a

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
huge range of heterogeneous

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,720
computing environments especially as we

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,480
power all the ai services

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,000
that are going to interact with this

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,760
intelligent world

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,959
and connecting these two environments

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,800
are going to be all the smart

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,880
connections that people live with

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,399
and this could be everything from your

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
broadband in your home all the way to

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,040
your 5g connections out into your

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,959
environment

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,000
but all of these need to be tied

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,279
together with smart connections

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,120
and two of the most fundamental things

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,440
are powering you know these in terms of

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,519
how we are building this out at huawei

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,839
are two new operating systems that we've

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,399
been building out in open source

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
so from a distributed device standpoint

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,839
we have a new open source operating

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,800
system called open harmony which is

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,120
focused on

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,240
distributed iot devices and then for the

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,600
heterogeneous computing environments in

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,160
the cloud data centers

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,200
we have our open euler linux operating

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,040
system

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,959
but this is not just any old linux

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,800
operating system this is highly focused

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,839
on how do we bring the range of ai

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,360
capabilities

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,200
out to heterogeneous computing across ai

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,399
platforms running in the edge and the

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,959
cloud and

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
around heterogeneous hardware platforms

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
and so what i want to do

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,519
during the rest of this talk is just

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,040
explain to you a little bit more

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,959
both what we're doing from an open

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,959
harmony standpoint as well as what we're

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,079
doing from an open euler standpoint

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,839
and then tie it all together for you let

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,360
me go ahead and start off first

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,360
from an open harmony standpoint

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,160
so as i mentioned before open harmony is

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,240
our distributed

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,399
operating system focused on how do we

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,120
bring a new kind of user experience

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,360
around different consumer devices

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,839
and in order to bring this consumer

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,680
device ecosystem to market we really

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,200
think that there's a few key things we

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,639
need to solve from an industry

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,639
standpoint

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
first off just think about the range of

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
different devices that you have to

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,639
interact with

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,320
from a consumer device standpoint uh

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,079
you've got your smartphones you've got

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,200
cameras you've got speakers you've got

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,320
wearables

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,920
and so on all these things are coming

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,279
across different form factors

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,800
uh they're probably coming from

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,000
different vendors and different

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,680
technologies

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,920
uh and they all need to work together

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,839
from a unified ecosystem standpoint if

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,519
we want to start to enable them

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,240
to be able to cooperate together to

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,399
enable uh very broad-based experiences

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
across these different devices that

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,279
means you want

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,440
to have your you know smartphones

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,360
interact with your smart uh devices so

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,120
that they can share health information

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,880
they need to be able to interact with

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
your cameras uh and so that you can

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,920
interact with them or your

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,240
network connections so you can start to

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,839
share data as you see fit

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
that means that all this needs to be

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,160
built in an open source and

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,320
way but also with open governance so

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,000
that we can have a broad-based ecosystem

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,959
where everyone can come together on

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
equal footing

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,600
to be able to build this together and we

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
also have a common set of standards and

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,040
open technologies

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,040
that everyone can build upon so that all

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
devices no matter who it's from

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,360
and no matter what it looks like can

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,680
start to cooperate together

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,600
based on this foundation we can bring

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,959
forth a new kind of architecture

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,040
for how do we start to create a

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,279
different kind of operating system

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,320
which is really distributed across a

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,440
wide range of different devices

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,839
so this is where our open harmony

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
operating system comes in and the key

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,240
thing about open harmony is that this is

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,320
really a distributed operating system

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,639
that runs across multiple physical

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,079
devices so let me show you how we start

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,440
to build out the open harmony

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,120
architecture the first thing about open

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,959
harmony is that we focus

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,240
on uh distributed design so that we have

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,160
three fundamentally different

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,959
distributed capabilities

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,000
we focus on distributing task scheduling

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,199
data management

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,880
and a resource pool and remember this is

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,800
distributed across different physical

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,600
devices so i could be running across a

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,839
smartphone

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,199
across a watch across a smart screen for

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,800
example

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,639
in today's scenario the way that we

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,240
would build out interactions across

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,680
these is we would have one operating

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,240
system running on a watch

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,160
one operating system running on a phone

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,720
one operating system running on a smart

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
screen

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,399
and we'd probably have some kind of

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,839
cloud-based interaction that would tie

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,000
all these things together

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,440
and that's very inefficient because even

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,079
though these three devices are all

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,920
sitting

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,680
physically in the same room together

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,600
they all have to be tied together

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,079
through the cloud in terms of how they

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,320
interact and this is very inefficient

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,000
so instead what open harmony allows us

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
to do is it allows us to build a

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,639
distributed

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,880
mesh network across all these different

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,880
devices and to run the scheduling the

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
data management and the resource pool

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,720
dynamically across these different

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
physical devices as if they were one

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
physical device

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,720
and to aggregate them together into a

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,600
virtual device

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,760
and this is a key difference between

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,320
open harmony and other operating systems

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,720
and that

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,639
allows us to create this distributed

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
architecture across multiple physical

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,519
devices

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
but it's not just efficient to be able

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,240
to run

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,920
these capabilities in a distributed mesh

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,000
network across devices

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,360
it's also much more secure from a

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,440
privacy standpoint

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,600
because if you have to be able to share

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,160
all this data continuously across the

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,240
cloud

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
just to be able to have things interact

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,000
uh now this means that you're sharing

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,320
you know very very sensitive data you

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,560
know constantly streaming to the cloud

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,920
and that creates you know a very strong

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,079
you know point of failure

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,440
uh both from a privacy standpoint in

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,360
terms of an attack point

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,959
but also just in terms of you know how

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
are all these different cloud services

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,160
going to interact uh together

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
especially when you're dealing with

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,360
multiple vendors with all your different

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,279
devices

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,800
so instead we think it's a much better

00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,759
approach that you don't even have to

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,759
share your data

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,759
into the cloud in the first place

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,120
instead all your data can remain local

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
to your devices

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
and this allows everything just to be

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,399
able to work together across your

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,519
devices and protect your security in

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,040
your privacy

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,560
in a much better way we think this

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,000
approach is also much better for

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,560
application developers

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,120
because now application developers can

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,440
start to

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
create what we call these super devices

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,399
you know uh

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,000
and they can start really imagining you

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,639
know what if i could have you know a

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,040
camera

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,759
on a smart camera and you know my

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,160
interaction

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,880
on a phone and my speakers from my smart

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,880
speakers

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,560
and all these things can be aggregated

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,320
together to create a super device

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,079
because i just have distributed

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,160
capabilities across all these things

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,399
timed together

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,199
in order to support that open harmony

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,440
also supports

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,199
a wide range of different hardware types

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,839
so for example one of the things that we

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,920
enable

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,839
is supporting different operating system

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,320
kernels because we know we have to

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,920
work from very very small form factors

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,720
all the way up to much more capable

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,399
devices

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,160
so we'll support different kernels such

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,799
as the linux kernel or zephyr

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,400
or even light os and so we need to be

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,360
able to support a wide range of

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,959
different devices

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,199
and bring them all together as one

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,039
virtual device and this means that

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,600
application developers only have to

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,480
target

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,640
these aggregated devices once instead of

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,559
writing one application from

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,319
each device and then tying this all

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,480
together and dealing with fragmented

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,400
ecosystems

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,080
and this is also super beneficial for

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
users as they experience

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,360
these capabilities because now they can

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,360
start to experience

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,640
holistic scenarios now i'm just dealing

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
with the health scenario

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,120
uh in my home where i'm dealing with an

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,039
exercise scenario outdoors

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,880
i'm dealing with a work environment and

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,000
how do i you know collaborate with my

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
office mates

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,640
from a virtual environment standpoint

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,640
all these experiences are tied together

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,720
around all the different devices i

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,559
interact with versus i have to think

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
about how do i work with my watch how do

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,960
i work with my phone how do i work with

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,720
my laptop

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,880
then i have to stitch them all together

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,559
myself so this is a much better

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,320
user experience because they can

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,880
experience all their devices coming

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,679
together

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,559
in a very holistic manner and so

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,559
basically

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,640
we believe that this is fundamentally a

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,600
much better approach in terms of how do

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,919
we work with

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
consumers because we can give them this

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,120
much better

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,799
unified experience around how they work

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,919
with all the different devices that they

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,280
have around them

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,960
this is much better for all the

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,880
different device manufacturers

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,120
because now they can all tap into a

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,360
unified open ecosystem

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,559
where all their devices are not just

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,240
working by themselves

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,799
but they can collaborate with everything

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,280
else out there and this is also perhaps

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,360
you know

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,120
really really the best for content

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,799
creators because now

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,400
you can start thinking about how do i

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,120
create these different scenarios that

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,120
work across

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,440
all these different devices and just

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,200
aggregate them into these super devices

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,799
uh that support different content

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
scenarios you know whether it's

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,679
healthcare

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,280
whether it's fitness or anything else

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,000
that we want to dream up

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,320
and so we believe that this is really

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,840
where the future of devices are going

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,440
and how we can start to tie things

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,360
together

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,280
and so if we come back to that scenario

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,520
that i was showing in terms of the

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,280
healthcare scenario now we can start to

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,200
take all those different devices

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,200
so for example a smartphone a smart

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
camera smart speaker

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,720
your smart doorbell and your different

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,559
networking gear and so on

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,760
and we can now start to tie them

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,679
together

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,600
in order to do this the first thing that

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,400
we would do is we would start to

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,039
tie these all together into this virtual

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
mesh

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,960
network so that they all become

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,360
aggregated into a super device

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,000
now as part of aggregating them together

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,000
we elect

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,919
one coordinator which is basically going

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,760
to be responsible for how do we assign

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,280
you know all those capabilities such as

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,000
distributed task scheduling

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,080
or distributed resource management and

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,360
that one device will be responsible in

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,880
this scenario

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,400
in terms of managing it but it can

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,039
change dynamically based on the

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,520
environment that you go into

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,960
and similarly we can also train using

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,559
intelligent capabilities

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
uh you know across these different

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,960
devices so now your coordinator knows

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,400
how to be able to respond and interact

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,640
your environment based on what's

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,280
happening but keeping all the data local

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,080
uh to these devices and so by

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
aggregating

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,840
all these different devices into

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,720
distributed resource pools and a super

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,320
device

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,159
this is a way that we can start to

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,159
really help the devices work together

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,159
but that's just from a device standpoint

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,000
as i mentioned before we also need to

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,320
highly optimize what happens from a

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,840
cloud and from an ai standpoint

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,679
and perhaps one of the biggest

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,120
challenges as we think about how do we

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,640
start to provide the intelligent

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,840
capabilities in the cloud

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,320
is that ai training provides

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,960
two very fundamental capabilities it

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,720
trains

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,880
all the intelligent capabilities that

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
goes into the devices that we just

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,679
talked about

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,679
and it also provides a lot of ai

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,880
cloud-based services that interact with

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
everything that we do

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,440
uh to be able to tie everything together

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,400
into a very rich ecosystem

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,200
the problem though is that ai is a very

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,320
expensive

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,919
uh set of capabilities uh it's expensive

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,559
both in terms of

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,760
from a monetary standpoint in terms of

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,080
how do you run it

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,919
it's also perhaps even more expensive in

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,960
terms of the energy consumption that it

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,280
takes

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,360
here uh this is what happens from an

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,720
energy consumption in a typical cloud

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,159
data center and where all the

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,360
capabilities are going

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,080
as they start taking a look at more ai

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,039
focused

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,039
and data focused cloud workloads we can

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,960
see that the general cpu is heavily

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,400
heavily taxed as we start to run these

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
different workloads

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,679
in the meantime a lot of cloud data

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,559
centers are adding more and more

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,200
specialized resources such as npus

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,799
or gpus in order to be to run these uh

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,200
you know ai workloads

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,720
but the amount of these processors is

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
still relatively few

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,880
uh compared to general purpose cpus even

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,400
though they're highly more efficient

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,159
in terms of how do they run these ei

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
workloads

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,320
so we believe that the best way to

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,799
optimize these cloud data centers going

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,280
forward

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,320
both to achieve a peak performance but

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,880
also to be able to

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,559
achieve peak energy savings is to

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,640
optimize uh the

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,320
general purpose cpu to be much more

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,720
energy efficient and

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
processing efficient and so this is

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,720
where arm cpus especially come into

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,440
their own in the cloud data center

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,760
because as we all know arm cpus are much

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
more

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,440
energy efficient than a lot of other

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
capabilities and this starts to bring

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,320
down

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,440
the general purpose cpu capability

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,520
simultaneously

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,000
as we start taking a look at you know

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,760
all these gpus and nps which are highly

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
optimized for machine learning training

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,320
and

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,159
inference workloads now we can drive a

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,120
lot of those specialized workloads into

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,480
these npus

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,799
and now we can achieve the best

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,200
combination of performance uh drive them

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,320
into

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,080
more efficient npus and arm cpus

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
and also we can start to support

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,600
heterogeneous architectures

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,440
which gives us much better energy

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,120
efficiency

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,799
but if we really want to start going

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,720
after these architectures we

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,120
need to start supporting them from an

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,520
overall data center standpoint

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,400
and so this is where our open euler

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,320
operating system

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,159
is really focused on how do we start to

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,440
bring these highly optimized

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,200
ai workloads into the cloud data centers

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,880
and there's a few key innovations that

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,840
we've put into open euler

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
that i want to focus on the first is

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,280
that

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,159
open euler is highly optimized to be

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,120
able to support

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,480
all these different architectures from a

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,120
hardware standpoint

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,240
and so we focus not just on traditional

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,280
x86

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,960
processors from a linux architecture

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,960
standpoint but we really treat

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,360
every single hardware platform as a

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,400
first class hardware capability into

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,640
open euler

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,440
so how do we focus very well on arm

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,840
processors

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,240
from a cpu standpoint and also add first

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,919
class support for npus and gpus

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,440
and this is all because we want to

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,919
optimize open euler

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,600
to take advantage of these new hardware

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,360
architectures that are merging

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,440
between the cloud and the edge which are

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,080
highly heterogeneous from a processor

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,400
standpoint

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,679
but which need to support a wide range

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,600
of applications

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,080
and so by supporting all these different

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,240
applications across this heterogeneous

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,440
hardware architecture open euler is

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,440
really equipped

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,200
to be able to bring this new wave of

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,240
computing platforms into a highly

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,520
optimized way

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,600
to support intelligent workloads

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,120
now in order to be able to support these

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,960
ai workloads it's not

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,640
enough just to be able to support these

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,320
different hardware platforms

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,880
such as arm and such as you know

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,640
different npus we also need to look at

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,240
what are the capabilities within the

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,000
operating system itself

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,760
in order to be able to optimize for

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,520
bringing ai into these different

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,039
environments

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,360
now one of the things that becomes

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,880
critical is that it's not just

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,960
massive cloud data centers that are

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,919
going to be running these ai workloads

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,159
of the future

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,320
these are going to be also split across

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,159
heterogeneous architectures

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,320
and so for example we've got to deal

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,159
with uh you know cloud data centers

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,159
we've also got to deal with a lot of

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,679
these emerging edge data centers

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,840
that are spread out all across our

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,919
environments around us

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,600
so in order to be able to support that

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,600
we need to be able to also take the

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,360
operating system and to be able to

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
run them in all these different

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,520
environments uh supporting just the sets

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,520
of capabilities that are required

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,600
you know whether we're going on to a

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,080
very large uh you know public cloud

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,679
whether

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,360
we're going to private clouds whether

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,400
we're going to edge capabilities

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,640
and so on and so one of the key

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,520
capabilities that's been built into open

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,760
euler

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,039
is that it is very flexible in terms of

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,440
how do we compose

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,799
open euler to be able to deploy into

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,919
different environments

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,840
so fundamental uh to the open oiler set

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,679
of tools and the architecture

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,440
is that it is very modular and it

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,600
enables us to be able to select

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,600
just the components that you need to

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,840
deploy into a very

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,640
lightweight architecture in the edge for

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,880
example

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,919
or into a very rich environment running

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,480
in a full-fledged

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,760
public cloud and this allows open euler

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,320
to be able to support

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,880
with one operating system platform

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,360
across

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
all the different hardware architectures

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,520
as well as the different hardware

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,720
uh processors that you're going to be

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,039
running across

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,400
and so when we take a look at how we

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,360
support these heterogeneous

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,200
architectures

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,720
that are going to be powering these

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,039
intelligent capabilities

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,240
open euler is designed especially to be

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,919
able to support

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,440
the hardware diversity that you're going

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,200
to be running to power

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,840
all these intelligent capabilities in

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,840
the back end

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,320
another key innovation that we've been

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,240
putting into open euler is how do we

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,080
start to make open oiler lightweight

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,880
enough so that the operating system can

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
scale up

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,640
and scale down to these different

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,159
environments because it's not enough

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,799
just to be able to compose

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,840
a different uh you know uh features that

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,320
are going to be running

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,600
no in one environment or another we need

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,840
to make every single

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,000
feature that is running across these

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,159
environments as lightweight as possible

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,600
so that we can achieve a uniform

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,640
standard in terms of what are the

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,039
application

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,159
uh that are able to run across all these

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,360
different environments

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,960
from cloud to edge uh and so of course

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,559
you know two of the most important

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,480
environments uh that people

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,000
take a look at when they run across

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,320
cloud and edge platforms

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,600
are containers and virtualized

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,520
environments

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600
and so when you take a look at a lot of

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,240
the traditional technologies that people

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,320
are using

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,039
for containers and virtualization for

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,799
example you know docker or qmu

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,080
these are relatively heavyweight in

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,640
terms of how do we run them

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,919
across different environments and one of

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,000
the things that we have

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,919
highly optimized into our open euler

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,919
operating system is that we have

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,520
created new runtime environments which

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,840
are extremely lightweight

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,480
and which can run you know in a very

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,720
very small footprint from cloud to edge

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,559
and so for example we have our isolate

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,200
environment which is a highly

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,440
minimal footprint from a container

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,440
engine standpoint and so we can provide

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,120
a unified container environment that

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,960
goes from your cloud to edge

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,960
with no changes because it is running in

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,640
a very very small footprint

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,480
similarly from a virtualization

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
standpoint for your more traditional

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,600
scale up

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,240
applications we have our stratovert uh

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,720
you know

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,559
a virtualization runtime and this is

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,760
also highly optimized to run in a

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,279
minimal footprint

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,960
so that we can bring your virtualized

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,200
applications uniformly

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,720
from the cloud to the edge and so this

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,120
allows us to bring those ai

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,919
applications across all these different

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,320
environments

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,120
you know first from a different set of

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,039
processors

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,799
next to a different set of architectures

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,120
because we can compose the

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,120
operating system differently and finally

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,679
within the open euler operating system

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
itself

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,120
we've made the components as lightweight

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,039
as possible so that we can

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,880
scale across all these environments to

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,880
be able to run your ai applications

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,559
now one more thing that we've been

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,440
focused on from an open oiler and

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,520
especially from an

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,360
armed ecosystem standpoint with open

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,840
euler is how do we start to enable the

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,159
overall

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,080
ecosystem across us both from an

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,480
application

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,360
availability standpoint but also from a

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,240
security

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,279
standpoint and one of the most important

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,640
uh things that is

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,080
uh necessary is when you work across all

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,399
these different open source

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,320
architectures and applications is that

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,720
you need to enable continuous

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,520
uh you know testing and building across

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,840
all these different

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,520
environments and this is something that

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,080
pretty much every single open source

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
project

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,720
uh has uh you know they all have their

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,799
you know x86 based ci systems

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,320
which is all focused on how do we bring

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,559
you know all these applications

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,320
and test them you know across x86

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,000
architectures because this is the

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,600
you know set of platforms and the set of

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,559
tools that we've been living with uh you

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,760
know for these

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,480
last couple decades the problem though

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,880
is that you know

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,080
even though uh this set uh capabilities

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,159
is very important

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,440
you know and x86 will be with us for a

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,080
very long time

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,039
now we haven't had these similar sets of

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,799
capabilities

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,200
from an arm standpoint you know for

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,559
nearly as long and nearly in as mature

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,640
manner

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,760
and so one of the key capabilities that

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,159
we've also built at

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,679
huawei is this uh you know tool set we

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,440
call compass ci

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,919
which is really focused on how do we

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,799
enable you know a ci system for arm

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,760
across the open source ecosystem and so

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,159
what we have done

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,799
is that we have enabled compass ci to be

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,880
able to come

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,880
and uh build the same set of

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,320
capabilities from a ci standpoint

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,440
for all the different open source

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,840
projects onto an arm-based ecosystem

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,960
and simultaneously we have been working

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,360
with all the top

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,880
open source projects and ecosystems so

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,720
that they incorporate this

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,320
into their standard build systems so

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,279
that as we start to build these open

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,440
source projects

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,600
we automatically get arm-based builds

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,600
along with our x86 based builds

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,039
this highly optimizes us for this

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,120
heterogeneous world

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,720
that i've been talking about and this is

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,720
also super important

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,960
for making sure that these arm-based

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,960
platforms are secure and always get the

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,720
latest and greatest features as well

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,000
and so by bringing you know this set of

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
capabilities

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,080
this is how we start to enable and

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,120
support this heterogeneous platform as

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,120
we take a look at

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,720
uh from a cloud computing standpoint and

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,279
from a data center standpoint

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,000
enabling this rich open source ecosystem

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,000
in the back end

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,760
so now just to come back and tie all

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
these things together you know we've

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,240
been focused

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,679
as i mentioned on really building uh

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,440
this future world

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,279
where we can start to tie everything

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,519
together and for us

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,120
it's really important to do this in open

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,720
source and this is why

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,880
you know on the device standpoint we've

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
been focusing on a new distributed

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,000
operating system that can aggregate all

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,200
your devices together

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,200
with open harmony similarly on that

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,200
back end in your cloud system we really

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,799
need a new kind of operating system

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,640
that works across heterogeneous

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,720
computing and that ties everything

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,360
together in a very lightweight manner

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,200
and this is open euler and by combining

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,640
the power of open source around all

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,000
these different environments from

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
distributed devices

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,919
to heterogeneous computing this is how

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,159
we think we can start to build

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,480
this future of pervasive ubiquitous

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,320
collaborative intelligence together

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,000
and so because we're doing all this in

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,919
open source we would welcome

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,919
you to come and participate with us and

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,000
to learn more about what we're doing

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,320
uh you can do this uh by coming to visit

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,840
our booth here at the lenero event and

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,480
we welcome how you to come meet our

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,880
experts and

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,559
talk with us as well as to join our open

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,080
source projects

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,360
so thank you very much and we look

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,120
forward to working with you and

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,039
collaborating with you on these uh in

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,039
