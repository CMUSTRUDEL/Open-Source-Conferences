Title: LVC21-305 OP TEE as a Secure Partition running on SPM using ARMv8 4 A SEL2 feature
Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	The ARMv8.4â€‘A architecture introduces the Secure EL2 extension (FEAT_SEL2) that provides virtualisation in the Secure world. This feature when used by the Secure Partition Manager (SPM) at SEL2 provides isolation of firmware components from multiple vendors like silicon, OEM, Trusted OS vendors.

This session will cover the use-case of running OP-TEE as a Secure Partition (SP) in a virtualised environment created by the Secure Partition Manager (SPM) in a platform with SEL2 support. We will cover the Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile processors (FF-A), a standardised communication interface between various components in the secure world and normal world. A brief overview of communication flow between OP-TEE driver, EL3 SPM Dispatcher (SPMD), SEL2 SPM Core (SPMC) and the OPTEE-OS. We will finally cover the current status of work and future plans.
