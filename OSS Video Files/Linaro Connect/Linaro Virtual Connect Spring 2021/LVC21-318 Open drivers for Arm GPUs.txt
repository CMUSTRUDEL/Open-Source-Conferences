Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	2020 was a watershed year for open source graphics drivers on Arm. For years, every Linaro Connect has asked when open drivers would come -- finally, they have. For Mali, open source support for Bifrost materialized with the Panfrost driver, working together with Arm. Adreno is seeing the open source Freedreno drivers shipping in production. This presentation will give an annual status update for open drivers for Arm GPUs with a view of what's to come.
