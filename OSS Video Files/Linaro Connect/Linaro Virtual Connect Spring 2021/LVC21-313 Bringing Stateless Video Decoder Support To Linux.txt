Title: LVC21-313 Bringing Stateless Video Decoder Support To Linux
Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	Under development for many years, support for video CODEC accelerators in Linux gained significant traction in 2020. A formal specification was merged into the Linux Media subsystem in v5.5, allowing for blob free hardware accelerated decoding on popular platforms such as Allwinner, NXP i.MX8, Microchip SAMA5, and Rockchip. In addition, H.264 V4L2 controls were destaged in v5.11, and the remaining CODEC controls will be coming soon to mainline.

In this talk, we will take a deep dive into stateless video decoder support for Linux, including an overview of the decoding process using hardware accelerators, a look at the user space API and how it's used within multimedia frameworks, and how this all works with modern GPU accelerators. Lastly, this presentation would not be complete without discussing the effort to bring native support in FFMPEG and GStreamer, and its major role in the development of the new Open Source drivers.
