all right are we happy to go

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,480
i hope so all right well

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,000
hello everyone i'm mato carlini thanks

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
for joining today i'm here with shabu

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,359
kuryakose my colleague

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,359
we are both the chairman of the project

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
for the trusted female.org community

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,160
project

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,039
and today we are going to give you an

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,039
update on the news and the latest

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,000
things that are happening in the context

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,960
of the trusted female community project

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,559
so first of all usually introduction

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
what the project is

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,800
so trusted firmware is an open

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
governance community project

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
for the entire secure software

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,480
development

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,840
in a collaborative way and i'm gonna

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,760
stress on the

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,160
entire sector software uh collection

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,079
because so the name says trusted

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,680
firmware and it originally

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,000
uh you know kicked off as a tfa and tfm

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,199
um project so trusted firmware for the

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
a-class devices

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,640
and for the m-class devices but over

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
time

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,560
it acquired and uh you know we were

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,360
joined by other projects

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
to provide a reference implementation

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,759
for a trusted execution environment

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439
for security libraries and now also for

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,680
security services

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,360
so really it's becoming a complete

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,920
reference implementation

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,000
of the entire secure software space on

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,240
arm devices

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,040
it's all open source the code is all

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,880
released under vsd3 clause permissive

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
license

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,960
we have a very advanced openci which

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,240
shebu is going to describe later on in

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
the project

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,439
and we are regularly running open forums

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
open chats that are open mailing lists

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,119
in which all the main topics are

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,119
discussed across all the projects

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,759
so i usually pick up some data some

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,000
statistics to

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,439
argument on the importance of

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,439
collaboration

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,560
so this time around the data that which

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,520
picked up in

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,079
for shebu's idea thank you by the way it

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
was

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,679
on the number of reported security

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,599
vulnerabilities

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,239
which have been addressed by all the

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,520
projects within the trustedfumer.org

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,319
community so that means all the security

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
fixes

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,520
that all the projects had to

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,480
develop investigate analyze apply

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,680
test and then validate and then tag and

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,560
release in one of the

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,040
open source releases for all the number

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,599
of

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,360
the security issues that either we found

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,319
or we were reported by security

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,120
researchers

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,480
or by the community so you can see it's

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,680
a constant number

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,360
and in the last 12 to 15 months we have

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,879
something like 33

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,480
so 33 vulnerabilities which counts

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,959
more than two per month okay so

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,560
if we consider this number and if we

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,440
consider the effort

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,080
that we had to spend in a collaborative

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,680
way you know with our security experts

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
to as i said do all the initial analysis

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,800
and then prepare the proper fix and

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,840
apply it

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,640
so you can easily see that if

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
these effort have to be multiplied in a

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,159
downstream way by

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
every single different downstream

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,799
implementation of tfa

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,519
by our partners or tfm or of t

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,200
or all the other security libraries that

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,840
becomes highly inefficient

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
it becomes not scalable because this

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,640
effort will have to be repeated

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,000
every time on every single downstream

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
implementation

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,879
so this clearly highlights how important

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,080
it is to put together all the brains

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,640
all the expertise all the skill set and

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,799
fix

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,080
our problems in this case security

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,439
vulnerabilities

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,280
provide a stable fix and maintain that

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,200
because the maintenance is also done in

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,000
a collaborative way

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,799
and doing that all collaboratively all

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,159
in the common platform that is

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,040
trustedhuman.org that is really

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,120
achieving

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,560
the security by scale that we are really

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,319
aiming for so

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,400
i'm going to announce some news in the

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,280
project the first news

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,639
is two new companies that are joining

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,680
the current roster

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,080
of company members so above you

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,520
see the current members and we were

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,199
recently joined

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,400
by nxm labs an open mobile platform

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,280
that was late 2020 and we published a

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
press release

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,400
to announce those two companies joining

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,880
the closest film family

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,759
and we are pleased to have them joining

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
both the board

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,759
and the tsc which are the two main

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,400
governing bodies and entities

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,280
that runs the project so the board of

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
directors

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,639
is the entity which covers the strategic

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
direction

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,280
and investment decisions of the trusted

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,199
human projects

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
the technical steering committee is the

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
governing body which

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
uh discuss and decides on the technical

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,840
matters

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,960
for all the projects part of the of the

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,680
community

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,680
so now let me go a bit in deep into one

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
of the latest release for a couple of

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
projects part of trusted firmware which

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,680
is tfa

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,320
and the combined hafnium the release was

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
done

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,919
in november it was a major 2.4 release

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,520
and it was important the stepping stone

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,080
because it was the very first

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,520
release of hafnium as a reference secure

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
partition manager

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,680
for the security l2 arm utilization

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,039
extension

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,479
this is the first linear connect in

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,800
which i had the opportunity to announce

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,400
it

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,639
but the release is out since november

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,199
the next slide will explain more the use

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
case that we enable with that

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
and i'm just going to point you to

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,039
another talk later this week

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
which explains how we are able to run

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,800
opt

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
as a securial one partition on top of

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,280
half new running

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,520
at sel2 but before we move to that and

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,199
deep dive on that use case

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,759
the 2.4 tfa release also

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,800
saw other features which were promoted

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,680
upstream

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,639
the complete set of the 8.6 architecture

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,759
feature support

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,840
from the a-class architecture

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:27,120
boot support in tfa support for a split

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,319
a dual route chain of trust in the

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,280
boot chain and then the usual bunch of

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,120
new platforms

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,319
so there are some our platforms they are

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
morello board

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,960
and they are total compute t0 platform

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,400
which are respectively

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,080
a research board for the

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
capabilities architecture which is a

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,960
research program run by

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,800
arm and the uk government and the total

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,479
compute platform which is a complete

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,560
mobile software stack

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,400
running an android system um on top

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,479
and then we've got the usual bunch of

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,160
partner boards we enable more than 10

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,080
partners in the last release

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,400
i promised the deep dive on the use case

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,880
for hafnium so here we go

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,360
the main use case is really enabling

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,199
isolation for virtualization

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,080
in the secure world so what do i mean by

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,880
that

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,199
well we mean basically enabling what you

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,479
can call like secure

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,720
vns so vms that runs in the secure world

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,560
we call them secure partitions in the

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,720
software architecture

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,199
which are isolated partition

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,479
which only sees a limited set of system

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
resources

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,960
which is defined by the underlying

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,840
entity by huffman

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960
and two or more partitions are isolated

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,160
one another

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,199
that means that it allows um

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,560
our partners to deploy different type of

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,720
services

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,599
into one of these partitions and these

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,560
services can be mutually distrusting

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,560
one can be a full complete trusted os or

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,199
a trusted execution environment another

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,759
one can be a trusted services or

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,440
securities

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,800
um it doesn't matter they are

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
independent one another

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,599
and the other key point which these

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,000
slides is trying to capture

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,440
is also the effort around the

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,120
standardization of the interfaces at the

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,680
boundary level

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
so if you see all the blocks with ffa we

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,120
went through a lot of effort in the past

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
months for enabling the firmware

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,000
framework for a class

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,200
ffa spec is a specification from arm

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
which defines

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,360
how the normal world can call for secure

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,120
services into the secure world

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,279
and how all the message passing and all

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,480
the resource allocation happens

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,000
in the second world by the adoption

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,800
and the standardization of these

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,680
interfaces we aim to really defragment

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,839
and clean up

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,600
the tcb on the arm devices ecosystem

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,880
and the final use case that we are

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,920
enabling if you see the dotted lines

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,200
on the el3 sl2 but also on the normal

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,399
world

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,360
so with the introduction of securil2

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,080
basically el3 and scl2 so the highest

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,160
privileged

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,440
pieces of software firmware that runs on

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,320
your devices

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,760
are protected from possibly compromised

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,880
software which runs

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,160
in the secure partitions and so are

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,839
the normal word hypervisors or kernel or

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,800
applications

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,240
so how's that in the previous situation

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
if you have a compromise software

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
running

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,760
in a partition a trusted application

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,040
gets compromised the malicious software

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,160
gets deployed on the secure world so

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,120
in a usual scenario this malicious code

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,640
would be able to easily jump from scl1

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,200
down to el3

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,320
without the protection of a cl2 in a

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,720
scenario with no

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,920
cl2 in the picture but with the cl2

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,880
that malicious code is confined

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,160
in that single partition and there it

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,240
remains

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,279
so it doesn't go around and poke in your

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,800
system it just remains confined there

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,279
and that's really the key point and the

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,360
key message that i want to convey around

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,839
the isolation which is achieved

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
by this new software architecture

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,959
few ongoing developments for half human

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,920
trusted firmware a

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,680
regarding hafnium i can point you to the

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,680
specific deep dive call which is

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,040
happening on thursday by our hacking

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,480
maintainers

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,720
there are activities on going for

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,640
hardening hackney introducing support

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,079
for the pointer authentication extension

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,320
and vti

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,440
there is a new driver for the sm new arm

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
system ip

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,640
and we are enabling support for the neon

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,720
and sv registers in secure partitions

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,120
there is work on going around power

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,120
management and interrupt handling

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,120
and we are also enabling because for now

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,920
we are able to demonstrate

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
opti as a full trusted os running in a

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,040
secure partition

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
but we are also working to enable a

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,760
scenario with

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,480
only security zero partitions which runs

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,600
secure and trusted services so that

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,920
means

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,959
services which do not have to rely

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,680
necessarily

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,360
on a trusted os but can be independent

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,680
and can sit on top of hackneying

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,079
independently other activities ongoing

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,760
support for the 8.7 architecture

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,320
features

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,680
which has been published by arm last

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,920
september

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,240
there is a new ip for the automotive

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,360
market a newbie interrupt controller

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
a geek 600 automotive edition

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
which adds a few functionalities

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,240
relevant for the automotive ecosystem

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,720
that we are enabling in tfa

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,320
and then um there are other three talks

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,040
which i'm pointing you to

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,120
um during this week one is around the

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
standardization effort on firmware

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,920
update

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,279
and there is a specification work going

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
on um

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,440
which is going to be explained in this

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,320
talk and tfa will provide again

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,680
stepping stone for the implementation

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
there's a talk about

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,160
the firmware configuration framework

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
which is a way to dynamically configure

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,360
the firmware with platform-specific

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,760
information

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,680
that are not hardcoded but that are

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,399
passed dynamically throughout

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,160
different bulldozer stages and then

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,920
finally i spoke about measured boots so

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,200
there is another deep dive presentation

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,320
on measure boot

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,079
uh later this week on thursday

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,079
with that i'm gonna pass on to shebu

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
hi everyone uh thanks mateo uh so i'm

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,639
going to just

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,200
uh kick off by uh going back in history

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,240
so when trustedfirmware.org was launched

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,399
back in 2018 as what you were saying

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,200
uh we just had two projects trusted

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,240
firmware a m uh in 2019

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,519
linaro transferred the ownership of opti

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
into trustedformed.org and in 2020 we

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,800
had

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,880
embed tls and half game also joining the

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,519
trusted firmware family

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,399
all these uh firmware components have

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,440
together

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:15,040
enabled trusted firmware to provide a

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,880
high quality reference secure world

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,839
implementation for both cortex-a and

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,800
codex-m platforms

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,000
uh we are very glad to announce the

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,240
newest arrival

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
to the project portfolio uh through

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
trusted services

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,680
uh trusted services again complements

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,639
the existing

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,959
trusted firmware or projects in

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,320
increasing the capabilities of the

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,800
preference secure world implementations

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,360
now let's look at trusted services very

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,600
briefly

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,519
trusted services at a very high level

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,040
can be considered as a framework

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,279
to develop test and deploy

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,440
secure services on a wide variety of

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,120
isolated processing environment

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,360
by isolated processing environment it

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
can be a virtual machine running over a

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
hypervisor

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,000
it can be a trusted application in a

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,320
trusted execution environment

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,279
or it can be a separate secure core that

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,000
is providing

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,000
root of trust to the entire platform

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,079
as you can see in this diagram these

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,199
applications can

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,040
call into the trusted services uh using

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,480
a client server model

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,760
and uh any application into these

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,040
trusted services

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,160
using an rpc mechanism using a defined

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,600
service access protocol that is defined

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,639
on a per service basis as a starting

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,360
point

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,160
trusted services is providing secure

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,120
services

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,440
exposing the same psa functional apis

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
for

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,000
cryptography storage and attestation

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,120
similar to what we have in trusted

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,560
firmware m

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,240
project today and our initial reference

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,120
implementation

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,519
you can see at the bottom of the slide

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,920
is

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,880
going to be based on opti running as a

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
secure

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,519
el1 trusted operating system with these

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,360
trusted services running as secure

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,760
partitions or opti

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,839
enabling normal world linux based

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,040
applications to call into these secure

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,680
services and avail

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,800
secure services uh again i would

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,360
encourage you to watch

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,480
uh deep dive into trusted services uh by

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,000
julian hall

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,959
later today moving on to some of

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,800
our other project activities uh starting

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,279
with trusted firmware m

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,360
uh as the project has matured over the

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,000
last couple of years now we have moved

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,959
into a release model of releasing every

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
four months

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,480
uh we are in the process of getting

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,920
ready for the next

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,279
tfm 1.3 release which is uh planned

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,839
for to happen in early this is going to

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,079
come with

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,880
uh an exciting set of new features

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,000
including

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,480
a new psa firmware update service

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,560
uh the profile work com gets completed

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,040
with enabling profile launch

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,680
and the initial enablement for the

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,399
latest psa firmware framework 1.1

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,800
version

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,000
and this just adds to the set of

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,959
functionality that was

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,399
there in 1.2 with level 3 isolation we

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,759
had done work around

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,959
some generic software mitigations for of

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,199
to mitigate against physical attacks etc

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,160
uh tfm is also now enabled on a wide

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,759
variety of

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,839
silicon platforms uh as listed here and

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,880
looking ahead we have also started

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,759
enabling tfm for the latest cortex-m

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,000
cpu that's cortex m55 using the core

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,399
stone 300 reference platform

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,680
and over the last several months we and

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,519
now tfm has got

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,519
a good level of integration with some of

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,839
the popular art process

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,440
like ambidos friartos and sapphire as

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,480
well

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,519
moving on to mbtls so embed tls

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,800
uh now marks one year since uh it was

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,279
transferred

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,079
in as a trusted firmware.org community

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,720
project

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,760
uh again we are seeing a lot of uh

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,679
contributions

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,839
coming into this project so thanks for

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,079
all that uh

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,199
these are the three major areas of work

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,760
that we are focusing on

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,679
at the moment embed tls 3.0 which is

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,480
going to be a major release which

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
will have a lot of deprecated apis

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
removed

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,480
uh cleaning up of obsolete features etc

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,480
which we are planning to release by

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,760
middle of 2021

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,799
uh tls 1.3 we have an initial prototype

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,280
implementation

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,559
which is getting uh cleaned up and up

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,960
being upstreamed

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,080
uh functionality by functionality into

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,919
mbtls so

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,919
we would have an initial level of

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,200
support for tls 1.3

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,120
later on in this year one of the major

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,200
focus area for the project as a whole

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,320
over the years has been psa crypto

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,880
implementation

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,600
so we've made great progress in terms of

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,039
implementing the psa crypto apis

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,760
uh as the user facing apis

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,559
uh that can be used by tls and other

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,919
security

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,280
use cases and over the last uh three to

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,520
six months now we've

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,919
defined a psa crypto driver interface

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,039
that enables embed tls or psa crypto

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,160
implementations

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,000
to secure elements and accelerators

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,799
so quite a lot of progress in this

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,799
project as well

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,280
now if we look at some of the other

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,160
community activities that has been

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,400
happening

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,520
uh in the recent months uh we have got

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,320
the tfa

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,039
and tfm technical forums that was kicked

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,600
off

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,720
around an year back so these are calls

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,360
where we decide

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,039
discuss a lot of new design ideas get

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,960
feedback from the community

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,720
so this is a bi-weekly forum which i

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,320
would encourage all of you to join

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,400
uh there are quite a lot of discussions

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,760
happening in these forums with embed

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,160
tls coming onto df.org we arranged a

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,240
virtual workshop back in november which

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,360
was highly successful attended by around

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,160
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,080
people from around the globe there were

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,679
technical talks on the project on a wide

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,400
variety of topics

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,480
including areas like how can people

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,080
contribute easily to embitter-less

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,960
projects become reviewers and

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,600
maintainers

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,160
so again at them these are all attempts

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
to

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,000
expand the outreach and the community

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,120
participation around all the clustered

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,720
format.org projects

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,919
uh moving on um so as matthias

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,240
telling in the beginning of the

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,480
presentation

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,480
we there are a lot of activities around

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,200
open code development reviews

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,440
uh technical steering committees uh this

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,520
is

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,280
all behind the idea that the at the

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,400
heart of trustedformat.org

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,799
is collaborative development one

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,000
important pillar of this collaborative

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,559
development is of course

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,080
to expand the technical leadership of

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,679
some of these projects

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,880
to reach beyond arm engineers

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,679
tfa had kicked off uh this by having

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,720
maintainers

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,120
outside um from last year and today

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,799
we are very proud to let you know that

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,240
even some of the other projects

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,240
is taking a similar route so hapnium

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,000
its maintainers list so that has got

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,240
maintenance from google

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,320
uh linaro and arm uh for empty tls also

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,480
we are expanding uh the review and

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,640
maintainership list with steven coorman

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,320
from silicon labs being appointed as one

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,520
of the official reviewers

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,159
and uh very recently actually this month

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,720
uh trusted firmware m got its first

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,600
non-army trainer so chris brandt has uh

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,080
kindly

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,080
accepted the nomination to become the

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,080
trusted firmware and maintainer as well

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,280
moving to another topic

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,400
on open test system so one of the

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,400
biggest investment

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,799
that this community project has done

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,440
over the last 12 to 18 months

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,760
is to develop an open test system for

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,200
all the constraint projects

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,039
this is with the sole aim of increasing

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,240
uh or making the collaborative

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,520
development

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,080
easier for the community uh so here the

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,320
motto as shown in this diagram is every

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,360
trusted firmware patch that gets

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,039
submitted

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,480
uh in turn triggers a jenkins job

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,360
gets built on all the supported upstream

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,240
platforms

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,120
and those build artifacts are then

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,240
tested

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,880
on a variety of platforms as well

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,919
so we started this journey around 18

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,240
months back

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,760
and again a great milestone that we've

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,559
achieved in the recent weeks

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,679
is both tested from where m and a is

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,919
moving to a model

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,320
where every commit of these projects are

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,400
now being gated by the open

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,159
test system so these results and the

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,799
maintainer feedbacks would be the key

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,200
things

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,320
to decide submission or merging of these

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,120
patches

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,440
and we are also looking at expanding uh

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,360
the

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,360
open test system to support all the

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,080
upstream platforms from the

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,799
members as well uh again i would suggest

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,840
you to have a look at

00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,960
ci.trustedformed.org where the open test

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,120
system

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,960
front end is getting hosted and you can

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,960
see all the tests that's happening today

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,720
finally i'd like to close by quickly

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,360
looking at what are all the upcoming

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,559
topics

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
looking slightly ahead into the future

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,880
openci still remains a big focus area

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,559
for

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,640
trustedformat.org we have now got a good

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,760
baseline with trusted firmware m

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,320
and a we want to expand it very soon uh

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,799
to have more member platforms but also

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,760
cover

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,240
other projects mbtls is going to also

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,440
support

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,200
openci again a project with a lot of uh

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,880
contributions so we want to make sure

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,880
that when people makes

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,039
contributions to this project they can

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,080
easily see the test results if there are

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,360
problems they can

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,360
fix and resubmit the patches uh trusted

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,320
firmware community activities we have

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,440
got the

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,000
uh the technical forums uh going in full

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,480
stream

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,480
but we want to have more evangelization

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,120
of our community efforts to

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,080
make people aware of what these projects

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,240
intend to do

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,760
bring about more uh developers from

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,440
across the board

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,640
to support the community project as arm

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,760
evolves its architecture in the a r

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,280
and m space these projects would be one

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,679
of the first projects to get

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,720
those enablements so in the codex m

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,000
space as i said

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,559
in the tfm slides we've started enabling

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,559
trusted firmware m with some of the 8.1

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,679
m architectural features

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,679
uh similarly with r64 also there'll be

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,720
enablements in the trusted relevant

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,159
trusted firmware

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,279
projects and the

00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,720
new architectural evolutions that uh

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,279
arm will be doing those enablements will

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,039
also be

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,120
uh supported in the projects finally

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,880
long-term stable releases is something

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,520
that the community has been talking

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,679
about

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,600
for a while now today only mbtls

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,480
supports lts releases

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,840
so something that uh we as a board

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,640
technical steering committee and the

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,320
community

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,720
will be discussing in the coming months

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,159
is the viability of having long term

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,360
stable releases for

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,240
some of the constraint projects

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,000
again an excited roadmap would encourage
