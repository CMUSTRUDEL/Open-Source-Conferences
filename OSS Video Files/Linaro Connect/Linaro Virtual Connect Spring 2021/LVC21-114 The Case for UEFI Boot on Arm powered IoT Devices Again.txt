Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	This topic needs no real introduction, as the Arm Community has spoken about the needs for Standards and easier booting of devices for years now.  However, let's take a fresh look at the "why" this matters for businesses.  In this talk, I will present a tale of board-enablement for two devices, one x86 and one aarch64, in order to reach a point of booting and running a container.

In addition to the actual financial consequences due to the lack of standardized booting, I will also talk about the scalability issues faced when attempting to grow IoT projects and expand edge computing workloads.
