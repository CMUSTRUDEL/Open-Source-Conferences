Title: LVC21-114 The Case for UEFI Boot on Arm powered IoT Devices Again
Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	This topic needs no real introduction, as the Arm Community has spoken about the needs for Standards and easier booting of devices for years now.  However, let's take a fresh look at the "why" this matters for businesses.  In this talk, I will present a tale of board-enablement for two devices, one x86 and one aarch64, in order to reach a point of booting and running a container.

In addition to the actual financial consequences due to the lack of standardized booting, I will also talk about the scalability issues faced when attempting to grow IoT projects and expand edge computing workloads.

all right welcome everyone so hopefully

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,879
you all can um

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,600
see the title slide here the case for

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,679
ufi

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,080
boot on arm powered iot devices again

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,360
for about the millionth time so i'm

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
david tishler

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,520
um folks from the community probably

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,160
have seen me around at a couple of

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,720
lenaro connects in the past

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,800
i founded and still operate a small

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,840
startup by the name of mininodes

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,519
and thank you axel i see confirmation in

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,600
the chat you can in fact

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,000
see me i'm not talking into thin air

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,079
that's good news

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,520
so after you just saw

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,079
samir present and vincent present on the

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
need for

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,320
standards um i'm going to give

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,280
one slightly different alternative spin

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,960
on these need

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,879
for standards and i also realized

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
i'm the final speaker of the day so if

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,760
you're still here watching

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,159
thank you i appreciate it because i know

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,799
in the real life events by the end of

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,760
the day

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,159
you know it's uh it's it's the struggle

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,240
so

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
i appreciate it all right so let's get

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,479
going here

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,119
the good news is i was targeting about

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,280
25 minutes with some time for questions

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,799
but we might end up a little bit

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,439
quicker so as i mentioned yet another

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,159
take on why standards matter

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,600
and fair warning i know that you're all

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,240
engineers but this is not

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,119
actually a technical talk it's more of a

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,320
story

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,520
about attempting to bring up a device

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,720
actually this device

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,479
on a yakuto based uh os and

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,000
that board is uh a rock chip soc and

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,759
we're gonna talk through that

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,720
and talk about some dollars and cents

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
but first like any good presentation

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,479
especially

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,479
at the end of the day i wanted to get in

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,840
a little bit of buzzword bingo

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,280
and talk about what the future

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,479
in say five to ten years

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,120
now from now looks like so

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
obviously you guys already know it's the

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,879
quantum

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,000
hyperscale blockchain ai

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,560
yakto powered correct john

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,680
distributed serverless multi-cloud

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,680
kubernetes

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,920
architecture um but the point is this

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,840
really what i'm getting at is you know

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,840
for the past couple years we've seen

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,480
all the buzzwords all the marketing

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,160
slides all the keynotes i mean what

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,280
happened this morning about 5g edge ai

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,239
iot

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,920
everywhere um and i don't know my

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,319
crystal ball is broken

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
maybe that happens maybe it doesn't but

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,720
um

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:57,599
i i believe that definitely um

00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:01,040
edge computing and the adoption of iot

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,080
into regular businesses and usage by

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,680
mere mortals

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,040
will probably happen

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,480
waving as well um

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,720
so as i'm saying

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
iot and edge computing it is everywhere

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,760
that's true

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,120
my dollar sign day job is actually

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,680
at an iot fleet management provider

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,040
balina balina dot io if you're familiar

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,159
with them

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,360
it's a management plane web-based

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,159
control panel

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,519
that allows you to manage and maintain

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,920
fleets of devices

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,720
you know whether that's ten raspberry

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,760
pi's

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,480
a hundred jets and nanos a thousand

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,000
toradex or vericite boards um you know

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,599
whatever the case may be

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,080
gives you a tunnel back to the devices

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,360
uh to be able to interact with them it's

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,799
got um

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,799
root a and root b partitioning for

00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,920
um upgrades and it's all based on yakto

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,159
yakuto

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,200
you can see there there's about 60 some

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,159
odd

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,760
discrete device types that are supported

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,599
the common ones of course are pies

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,439
jetsons beagles

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,720
and then some others compulab which we

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,400
just saw in the previous

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,120
session cti um

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,079
trying to think of video a couple others

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
in there as well

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,240
but uh anyways molina builds their own

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,080
os it's based on yocto

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,600
and then there's a few tidbits thrown in

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,919
for um

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,520
the container engine the vpn link up to

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,000
the cloud and

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,160
some uh some other uh you know

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,400
interactivity bits

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
but what that really means is that

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,560
balina builds

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,120
60 some odd unique os's

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
differing boot loaders different boot

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,759
partitions

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,199
different alignments spoiler alert it's

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
not scalable

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,960
not in any way shape or form we also

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,720
build precisely

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,080
two x86 images one for the nook

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,800
and one that is a generic x86 64

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,120
which has more drivers included the neck

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,960
image is slimmed down and only includes

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
the ethernet wireless and

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,479
um bits that are

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
video drivers and things that are

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,440
already a part of a knock so it's a

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,440
little bit smaller image

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,280
um quick screenshot of

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
um it's kind of hard to see actually now

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,400
that i have it live but on the right is

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
a list of

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
some of the boards that are supported

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,039
but

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,720
as i already said you guys are all

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,720
engineers i already know that

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
i'm sort of preaching to the choir here

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,039
but you know

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,759
all about u-boot device tree boot

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,039
loaders

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,840
kernel your board enablement experts

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,080
the thing is is the other 99.999

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,759
carry out the nines as far as you want

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,759
of the world is not

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,840
so as i'm looking forward

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,039
five or ten years down the road kind of

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,160
as i said

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,120
and regular business users and

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,400
regular it departments want to begin

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,560
participating in this

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
revolution we'll call it edge computing

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
revolution i mean that's what the

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
marketing

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,039
slides i'll say that the revolution is

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,240
coming um

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,479
how are that how are they going to

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:32,400
participate how is that going to go

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,400
so let's find out i'm a business user

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,360
but i happen to acquire

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,800
like i said this board right here

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,319
this is what's called an i pi um

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
you know if it doesn't have pi in the

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,000
name it's not going to sell

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,000
so this is an i ipi stands for

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
industrial pie

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,039
it is produced by adlink they're a big

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,479
vendor they build a lot of stuff

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,639
it's a nice little piece of equipment

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,919
quite honestly um

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,199
it's a rock chip px30 soc it's got two

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,840
gigs of ram

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,720
uh comes in various flavors of emmc i

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,000
want to say like 16 32 64 gig

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,120
it does have usb 3 on it dual ethernet

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,800
and can bus as well so it does target a

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,680
more industrial

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,759
or enterprise-grade crowd than your

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,800
typical raspberry pi

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,720
and i want to boot baleena os on it so i

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,319
can control the board

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,319
from the cloud and interact with it no

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,479
matter where it is

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:38,560
sounds easy enough it's just yokto right

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,560
well turns out i was wrong

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,240
you can't just flash something from a

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,720
usb stick and boot it up

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,919
again you already know that i found that

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
out the hard way

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,960
so i went to go in bolina create a

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,400
device add

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,720
you know from the list it's not in the

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,360
list obviously okay fine what do i need

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,240
to do

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
to get it to appear in the list or

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,800
enable

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,720
it to bring up the os all right

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
i guess i need to start learning about

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,759
recipes

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,840
so i can see here the u-boot recipe

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,360
all right i need to now learn about what

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,240
these custom rock chip

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
binaries are um it's a little bit hard

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,080
to see in that screenshot

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,080
but there's a few of them that need to

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,199
get written into very specific

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,039
places and then i have to figure out

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,639
which one is this the device tree and

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,680
the dts and start

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,760
patching in px30 because

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,800
only the three three two eight three

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,200
three nine nine

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,839
couple other of their three two eight

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,760
eight is

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:47,279
already in uh main line so now i'm

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,399
hunting down patches next i

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,399
am which one is this uh

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,560
is that still the device tree bringing

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,600
in the device tree okay i have to learn

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,800
about a dts

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,000
file which is not the same as

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,440
a dtb file found that out the hard way

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,320
too

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,519
on and on and on again i'm not an

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
engineer

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,279
finally all said and done i get all of

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,040
the layers

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,920
i get all of the recipes correct in my

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
mind

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,680
and now i have to figure out where to

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
place these things into specific

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,160
partitions

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,920
and i have to write them at very

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,399
specific locations

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,320
i had to go research that and reverse

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,360
engineer that process

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
this is in my mind at this point totally

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,760
crazy

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
again might be what typical's days work

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,519
for

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,640
you guys but businesses are not going to

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,680
be able to figure this out so at the end

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,160
of all of this frustration

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,000
i think about it and it took me about

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,920
six months of reading research

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
learning this was a you know a side

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,560
project so it was just on and off work

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
to boot this board up and successfully

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,279
run my

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,240
os of choice that's not feasible

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,880
so i was successful in the end i got it

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,040
online

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,240
again you know six to six month endeavor

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,200
but uh

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
i now can boot uh a yakuto based balina

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,279
os

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,519
on that board but i started to think

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,800
i've seen some of the single board

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,880
computers

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,880
that are x86 based

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,079
could what does it take to boot that

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,000
thing

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:33,040
i had seen in twitter uh on my feed

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,120
go by this little one called the rock pi

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,600
x built by uh radza um

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,880
john i see the comment dts plus dtc

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,160
equals dtb

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:48,320
yeah i learned that um so

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,519
the rock pi x is a little intel atom

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,959
z 8350 in the format

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,160
give or take of a raspberry pi

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,920
um actually let me go back one slide 75

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,160
dollars i didn't necessarily want to

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,040
spend 75 dollars but in the name of

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,440
science

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,560
i was willing to do it however it was

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,160
out of stock

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
i don't know if it's a limited

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,440
production run or

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,040
just everybody's snapping these things

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,040
up i couldn't tell you either way

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,519
i couldn't get it so i hopped on ebay

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,040
and they didn't have any either but

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,920
while searching for that

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:29,600
atom z8350 i found this beauty

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,839
and it's here on my desk it is

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,120
a motherboard from a little two-in-one

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,120
thingy that hp

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,640
built and you can see 15 what a bargain

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,160
here it is right here it has

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,920
a usb port a usbc

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,000
for power and a midi or is it micro

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:56,000
hdmi out i can't remember um which one

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,920
it is but uh it's the one that's on the

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,920
pi 4 so i think that's the micro hdmi

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,200
and sure enough i download

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:12,880
the generic

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,880
x86 image for a balina device

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,000
flash it to a usb stick insert the usb

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,040
stick into this board i did have to go

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,079
into bios

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,200
uefi and disable secure

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:31,920
boot and then click

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:35,200
boot from usb and it turned right on

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,639
so all said and done

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,320
it took approximately 12 minutes

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,240
start to finish versus the six months on

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,200
that other board

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,480
and there's a couple screenshots you can

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,040
see there of it down

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,120
it came online balina cloud starts

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,639
downloading its container engine

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,800
it's got a little supervisor that

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,800
manages the workloads and away we go

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,440
again roughly 12 minutes to get it

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,600
online

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,920
so in my role at bellino

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,279
in dollar sign day job i'm a developer

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,320
advocate

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,079
i watch customers

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,399
potential customers come in and

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,519
try to bring their iot projects their

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,320
fleets

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:29,360
um from prototype to production

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,120
and i see it

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,120
on a regular occurrence where

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,519
they go through the same exact exercise

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,760
that i just described

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,760
they start out perhaps with a raspberry

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,440
pi and then pivot into what they really

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,880
ultimately want their target hardware to

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,560
be and that could be you know like i

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,880
said earlier some of the more industrial

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,720
ones perhaps it's this ipai perhaps it's

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,120
a toradex avera site

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,079
uh you know cti any of the other vendors

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
um there's

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,600
lots of good high quality vendors out

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,720
there but if balina doesn't already

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,040
support the board

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
then they have to do that porting job

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,399
and

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,920
they just can't complete that process

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,680
because it's difficult so they begin to

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,720
build it out and they're now six months

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,839
behind schedule

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,399
or at the four month mark they give up

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,320
and they go and get intel nooks

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:27,120
and that's the truth i see it

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,120
on a weekly basis so

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
like i said in the beginning we'll talk

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,680
about money we'll talk about some actual

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,399
dollars and cents here

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,279
i performed this exercise part-time for

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
six months

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,560
and i'm not a true subject matter expert

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,240
i hacked my way through it but i learned

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,600
a lot and it was a good science

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,079
experiment and i

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,680
came out with knowledge wonderful but

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,040
what would a company do

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,680
a company is not going to

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
hire an embedded engineer that's going

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,000
to cost a hundred grand

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,519
usd that's not budgeted

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,279
they're not going to let their project

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,199
timeline slip who's going to deliver

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,480
that bad news to the executive team i'm

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
sorry that we're six months behind

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
schedule

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,959
it turns out that using uh the board we

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,000
chose

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,040
uh was a mistake so um

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,959
they're just gonna pivot to an x86

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,720
device that just boots

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:26,079
that's literally what's going to happen

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,720
um now

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,160
i'm gonna go ahead and look back into my

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,360
crystal ball

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,160
and fast forward five to ten years

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,000
you may say my crystal ball is broken

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,920
but i'm going to say

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,399
that arm is going to lose this edge

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,519
computing market and x86 is going to win

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
it

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,040
because regular businesses that want to

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,800
participate

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,199
can't however there is some

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,880
good news i'm not only here to deliver

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,440
doom

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,959
you just saw two previous talks that

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,079
focused on standards

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,880
ir and es and

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,000
there are more i'm the last session for

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,399
today

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
um grant if you're still watching i want

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,440
to say yours might be on

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,240
thursday if i recall correctly

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,680
um and i think there's one or two more

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,399
still upcoming as well

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,560
but the point is this the soc

00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:29,199
manufacturers the board

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,360
vendors integrators producers

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,839
need to work together and get this

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,360
solved right now there is a total of

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,759
one ir ready board it is a raspberry pi

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,279
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,800
and i can tell you from experience that

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,839
raspberry pi 4s

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,040
do not survive well in the wild

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,160
you cannot go place them in the canopy

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,160
of a jungle

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,360
or inside of igloos

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,040
in the arctic environment or any other

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,240
extreme condition for an iot

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,199
device we need more ir ready devices

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,920
that just

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,480
boot even better would be es or of

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,079
course

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,120
fully up to um sr

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,480
or make it even even easier but i'm just

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,120
saying at a bare minimum give me ir

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,280
baleno doesn't want to build 60

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,679
different operating systems

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,600
it's painful it's not scalable there are

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,240
hundreds of boards out there

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,760
that we would like to support but just

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,559
can't don't have the bandwidth

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,559
don't have the time

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,400
however if i can take something right

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,760
off the shelf

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,799
piece of hardware that has uafi

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,440
stick in a usb stick and away i go

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,480
fantastic customers can take that and

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,039
run with it

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,520
and not have to then pivot to x86 when

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:54,160
they can't get their board to work

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,799
um i just realized that chat is flying

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
by

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,120
and i have not been watching it so

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
sahaja i don't know if you've been uh

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,720
answering questions as they've gone by

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,840
but um

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,360
that's actually it for me

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:14,000
so i did come in a few minutes

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:18,880
early and let's go take a look at chat

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
and see if there was anything else

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,080
uh

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,039
john is laughing at my jokes okay good

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,039
good

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,039
yeah this is better with a real audience

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,720
i can't wait to get back to connect

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,240
in person but um you know

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,559
we'll we'll get there um until board

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,280
came with a pre-installed firmware yes

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,960
it had

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,559
uefi already on it that is absolutely

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,440
true

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,440
system ready

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
yeah that's the point exactly so as you

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,679
got it why can't it come with

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,480
u-boot or uefi on an spi flash ready to

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,480
go

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:06,480
um system ready yep

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
let's see here anything else

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,799
2016.14 to no we don't want that

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,320
um no i don't see any

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,360
actual questions

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,640
so don i guess it's actually back

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,799
over to you then knowing that

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,400
um this is the last session of the day i

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,679
don't know if you want to give any

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,080
you know final commentary um i'm sure it

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,039
was a long busy day but

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,799
tomorrow you guys are back at it no i

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,400
think that's it if you're all done you

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,240
can uh

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,000
say goodbye to everybody and we'll shut

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,200
her down all right

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,240
i'll give folks one last second to get

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:55,120
anything into chat

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,120
not seeing anything there

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,160
q a tab oh is there a q a tab and

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,600
doesn't have anything in it

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,120
ah okay andy have you tried u-boot on

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,559
bare metal have you tried edk ii

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,200
uh i assume you might be referring

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,360
specifically to this

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,000
board or i don't fully understand the

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,679
question so it might need you to clarify

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,520
but um or if you're able to

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,720
our attendees able to unmute i'm not

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,720
entirely sure

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,600
but um and vincent thanks great story

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,120
um so no the only thing i have tried on

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,400
this particular board like i said i was

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,440
successful in the end

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,640
um was just you know there is a

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,640
uh um

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,799
a vendor provided um

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,600
i want to say debian image and i was

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,320
able to

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,799
hack the bits out that i needed from it

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,679
and

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:56,880
put them into u-boot hacked together

00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,559
from existing metal rock chip

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,320
support for that px30 plus the

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,039
specific dtb um from the vendor provided

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,400
image and

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,720
you know essentially once i had it all

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
glued together um got it up and running

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
but

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,320
you know six months worth of work for an

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,840
amateur like me

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,840
um not exactly ideal

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:28,080
and so with that i'd say let's

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,080
