Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	With ION officially dropped from the Linux staging tree, its time to move forward to using the DMA BUF Heaps interface for userland-guided buffer type allocation.

We will cover brief overview of DMA BUF Heaps, and differences from ION. The recent work done to migrate AOSP logic that depended on ION to support DMA BUF Heaps, an overview of helper libraries that have recently been developed, status of what is upstream and what is in the Android Common Kernel. I'll cover some of the difficulties we may have upstreaming code and make a call for more active participation. Finally, I hope to be able to answer a few questions folk have about the transition.
