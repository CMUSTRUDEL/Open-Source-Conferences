Description: 
	Trusted Services is a new trustedfirmware.org project that provides a home for security related service components that may be integrated and deployed in different secure processing environments.  Whether running under OP-TEE as a trusted application, within a secure partition or on a secondary MCU, services that implement platform security function such as secure storage, cryptography and fTPM can be built using common components, interface definitions and test cases.  The presentation provides an introduction to the project and describes how a common framework can help with reuse and standardization.
