Title: LVC21-314: VirtIO on Xen hypervisor (Arm)
Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	The motivation of supporting VirtIO on Xen (Arm) is quite clear. There is an increasing interest and requirement to have flexible, generic and standardized cross-hypervisor solution for I/O virtualization in the automotive and embedded areas. Providing a standardized interface and device models for device para-virtualization in hypervisor environments, the VirtIO interface allows us to move Guest domains among different hypervisor systems without further modification at the Guest side. Xen hasnâ€™t supported VirtIO on Arm so far, this is a significant gap in the list of supported features and this gap needs to be filled. In this talk I will briefly describe the possible approach of implementing virtio-mmio on Xen (Arm) using Xen's IOREQ Server (I/O Request Server) feature to forward guest MMIO access to a DM (device model) which could be used to implement a virtio-mmio backend or even mediator outside of the hypervisor. I will outline the advantages and disadvantages of this approach as well as open questions/concerns regarding security, performance in the proposed approach and possible steps for the improvement. Also I am going to demonstrate a PoC on Arm64 based board powered by Xen with Guest running on VirtIO block device instead of a traditional Xen PV block device without any specific modifications to the Guest OS.
