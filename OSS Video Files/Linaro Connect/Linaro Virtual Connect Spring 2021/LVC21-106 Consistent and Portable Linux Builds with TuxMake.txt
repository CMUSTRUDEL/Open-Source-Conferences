Title: LVC21-106 Consistent and Portable Linux Builds with TuxMake
Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	TuxMake is a tool that automates Linux builds across different architectures, configurations, targets, and toolchains. You specify your choices, and tuxmake drives the build for you, doing the same steps in the same way every time.

TuxMake provides portable build environments as docker/podman container images, so that your team can use the same exact toolchain(s) across different workstation platforms. Reporting and reproducing build failures is trivial by sharing tuxmake command lines with others.

In this presentation, we will take a look on how to use tuxmake. We will cover the trivial and the not so trivial use cases, starting with a simple build, then looking at cross builds, incremental builds, bisecting, etc.
