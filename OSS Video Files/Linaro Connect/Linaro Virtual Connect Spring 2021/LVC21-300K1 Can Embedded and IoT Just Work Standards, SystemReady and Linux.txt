Title: LVC21-300K1 Can Embedded and IoT Just Work Standards, SystemReady and Linux
Publication date: 2021-04-15
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect Spring 2021
Description: 
	This talk will provide an overview of Arm SystemReady, a recently launched certification program based on a set of standards that enable interoperability with generic, off-the-shelf operating systems and hypervisors. SystemReady extends the former Arm ServerReady program to the embedded and IoT sector and we will cover the steps needed to make software ‘Just Work’ on these diverse platforms.

	00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,600
uh

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,440
good morning everyone uh welcome to the

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,160
third day of lenaro connect

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,840
um and thank you for having me here to

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,679
talk about

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,279
my name is grant lightly i am a senior

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,119
technical director at arm

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,279
and i'm the architect of the system

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,119
ready ir or iot ready

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,560
band and today i'm here to talk about

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,400
platform standards

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,519
uh how they apply to the rich compute

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,840
embedded in iot ecosystem

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,680
and i want to put forward the question

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,079
can embedded in iot

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,000
just work we've talked about just work

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
we've talked about things being boring

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,399
in the armed server space and that does

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,520
an awful lot for enabling operating

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,239
systems and

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
really making for a richer arm compute

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,360
ecosystem

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,800
so we want to talk about how we can do

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,480
that in other areas

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,120
um now first of all i just want to shout

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,320
out to lenaro for this tool and how this

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,680
conference is set up

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,760
i've been really impressed with how

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,320
interactive it has been uh

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,439
go ahead i mean i already see everyone

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,200
people doing this but

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,640
ask questions i will try to leave some

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,439
questions at the or to

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,799
answer questions at the end um but yes

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,400
please anything that comes up

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
ask and i'll try to answer them

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,840
so i want to talk about standardization

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,759
and if i'm talking about standardization

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
i have to start with how choosing

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,040
standards

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
is a balancing app to find the right fit

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360
for the ecosystems

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,479
uh standards they bring predictability

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,640
needed to support

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
so um for software to support armed

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,280
platforms

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
uh but if there's too much

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,520
standardization then we end up with a

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,119
rigid platform and partners don't have

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,000
the flexibility they need

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,280
to bring products to the market on the

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,960
other hand

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
if we don't have standards or don't have

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,240
enough standards then that brings along

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,680
a high software maintenance cost and

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,159
engineering cost

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,600
to port software onto the new platform

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,200
and then right in the middle there's a

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,640
balance there on

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,640
choosing standards that enable

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,679
innovation while also

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,959
supporting interoperability and we

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,520
learned this

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,239
really well when uh when we started

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
looking at

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520
doing armed servers in the course of

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
that

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
we talked with our partners we talked

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,280
with silicon and software partners on

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
what it is that they needed

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
to be able to bring across the market

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,160
and

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,400
support each other and out of that came

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,360
the armed server ready certification

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
program

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
which was based on a set of standards

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
and testing to confirm that platforms

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,200
met what was required by the

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,360
operating systems and really we've had

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,920
tremendous success with this

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,360
this is the expectation now of if you're

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,239
putting together an armed server

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,239
platform

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,440
that is going to run an off-the-shelf

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,280
operating system

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,200
be that windows or vmware esxi

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,200
or one of the enterprise linux distros

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,120
like sles or rel

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
you have to be server ready you have to

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,319
meet these standards

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,120
so with that success we started looking

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,400
at

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
what can we do to do that same thing and

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,080
bring that same

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
interoperability and just works to other

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,959
ecosystems

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,200
and so late last year we announced

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,959
the system ready program and the

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
system-ready program expands on the

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,760
success

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
of the server ready certification

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,080
program

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,799
however if we had approached this of

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,720
taking

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,920
what we did in server ready and just

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,840
apply that over the entire arm ecosystem

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,080
it simply wouldn't have worked right

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,760
because each part of the arm ecosystem

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,360
has different characteristics and

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,480
different needs

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,959
so we needed to take a look at each at

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,000
some

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,439
specific places determine what they need

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,159
and choose standards that

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,080
that are appropriate for that area so

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,200
what we have with system ready

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,560
is instead of uh we have one program

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,519
that has multiple bands each targeted at

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
uh particular use cases and ecosystems

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
so i'm just going to go through these

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,799
quickly

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
um over on

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,720
over on the left hand side we've got

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
system ready sr our server ready

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,639
and this is simply the server ready

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,320
program rebranded under system ready

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,479
to show how this is part of the larger

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,520
hole

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,320
next one over is es or embedded server

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,240
and what we wanted to do with es was

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,800
take the success that we had with server

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
ready

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,880
with the shrink wrapped offering system

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,680
market and be able to run that or

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,800
support that

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,040
on a larger variety of arm hardware

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
there are a lot of rmsocs out there that

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
are

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
performant devices that are great

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,639
candidates for running general purpose

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
software

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,160
and so es takes the server ready

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
standards it relaxes some of the

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,199
hardware requirements

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,880
but still allows the uh the

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,560
shrink wrapped os to run next one over

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,360
is ir which is the primary one i'm

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,639
talking about today and that's iot ready

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,360
so the ir program is focused on

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,280
primarily the embedded linux ecosystem

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,919
and some embedded bsd as well

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,960
as well as uh and other embedded os's

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,960
but primarily

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
there is an embedded linux ecosystem

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,919
that is really healthy

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,919
and we needed to choose standards that

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,800
made sense and fit well with what was

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,520
already happening

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,120
in the embedded linux space and then

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,320
finally there's one more band called

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,039
ls and that's linux group server

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,240
which is targeted for our hyperscale

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,919
partners

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,759
for the platforms where they want to

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,320
control the entire stack of firmware

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,039
and there's a definite preference for a

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,600
linux boot

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,960
based firmware stack right so within

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,479
each of these bands

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,160
we can choose a set of standards that

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,360
make sense within that

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,680
now if i back up a little bit further uh

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
server ready is part of a larger

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
initiative

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,520
that arms uh our arms broader push into

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,080
the edge and iot infrastructure market

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,000
and this is our project cassini a

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,280
project cassini is designed to ensure a

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,560
cloud-native experience

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,280
across a diverse set and secure edge

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,000
ecosystem

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,759
and it operates across three vectors the

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,960
first vector is platform standards which

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,120
is where system ready

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,639
sits and these standards are a minimal

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,479
set of features in silicon

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,680
to support and firmware to support the

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,639
os or hypervisor

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,360
second is security i mean arm believes

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,680
that

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,720
all connected devices must meet key

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,720
security goals

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,199
and you utilize a route of trust to

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,160
ensure a baseline of security

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,000
so the psa certified program builds

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
assurance that devices have a security

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,960
baseline

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,240
aligned with key standards and use case

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,039
requirements

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
in addition the parsec program is an

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,599
open source project that provides

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
cross-platform

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,400
architecture agnostic apis to

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,560
provide those security features into

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,080
applications

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,919
and then finally there is the cloud

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,960
native stacks and so

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,440
the project cassini aims to

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
uh well as iot market demands i mean

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,400
they're very based on segment

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,360
so use cases defining them is rather

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
complex

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,440
and involves secure gateways aggregation

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,280
devices cloud platforms connectivity

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
device and data management solutions

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,000
right there's a lot of pieces that go

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,240
into that

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,240
what project cassini does is it provides

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,800
reference solutions that are developed

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
in

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
close partnership with the ecosystem and

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,680
serve as building blocks for

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,960
infrastructure and iot edge use cases

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,039
if you want to know more about project

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
cassini you can contact us at arm

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,199
there's a link at the end

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,720
but i'm going to move back and to talk

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
specifically about system ready

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,440
now just like the server ready program

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,479
the system ready program is built on

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
three things

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,160
it's built on hardware requirements it's

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,199
built on firmware requirements and it's

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,639
built on testing hardware requirements

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,759
are defined in the the base system

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,160
architecture document

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
and this is if you're familiar with the

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,120
sbsa

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,599
or server based system architecture we

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,759
took that document we reworked it

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
factored out the generic portions that

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,759
apply to multiple bands

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,520
and created this this new document and

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,720
this is the hardware requirements

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,560
how you should implement the arm

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
architecture how you should

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,599
connect up devices for maximum

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
compatibility with os's

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,560
similarly there's a firmware

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,440
requirements document called base boot

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,120
requirements

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,959
and this again is derived from the

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,719
server based boot requirements from the

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,760
server ready program

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,320
um and this is the

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,240
standard behavior that are consistent

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,080
behavior that os's and hyper

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,360
advisors can rely on to deploy onto and

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,360
manage the platform

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,160
and the focus here is on the interfaces

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,760
not so much on the implementation

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,600
and then finally if we've got these

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,240
requirements these are only

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,000
really useful if we can test for them uh

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,360
so for each one of the bands of ir

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
we are producing an architecture

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,279
compliance suite uh

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,640
that tests the hardware features the

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,320
software features

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,720
and um uh and also compliant

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,399
um yes and so this is these are test

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,279
suites that are open source we're

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,160
hosting them

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,399
on github and this allows you to val

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,040
evaluate your platform for compliance

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,800
before bringing it to certification and

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,080
then we use the same test suite

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,519
for our certification evidence and this

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,600
goes for across

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
all the bands of of system ready

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,200
but that's that i mean i've talked in

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,680
very general terms

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,519
if we go and look at embedded i need to

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,480
start talking about specifics really

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,560
fast

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,240
um and so with system ready ir

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,160
i don't think it works just come in with

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
a set of uh requirements

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,320
that are different that are completely

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,200
different or require a lot of changes

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,040
from what already is there so it's

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,040
helpful to start with what i see

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,880
in the embedded compute in ecosystem

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,399
right now

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,399
and there's some unique characteristics

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
here first of all

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,240
there's a huge amount of platform

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,279
diversity the embedded

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,440
uh arm compute ecosystem is very healthy

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
there are a lot of socs there's a lot of

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
partners producing

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,920
devices uh and you can see that arm

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,160
devices are everywhere

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
what that means though is that there's a

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,600
lot of diversity in the

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,880
implementations a lot of vendor ip

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,079
blocks there's a

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,000
low standardization on particular

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,839
interfaces that are used

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
and these devices have to be highly

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,800
configurable because they're used in a

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,800
large number of different use cases

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
second there's a large amount of

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,240
software diversity

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,320
rather than uh a couple of

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,640
of major os's that are the de facto

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,560
standards there's a lot of ways to build

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,040
an embedded linux device

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,079
uh and this goes anywhere everywhere

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,920
from custom builds

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,079
based on yakto or open wrt um

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,760
up to distros that have been taken and

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,800
modified with maybe the kernel being

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
replaced

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,720
um and then third party supported

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,399
whether we're talking fedora iot

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,880
or one of the other products that that

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,600
are out there and this isn't even

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,279
discrete categories this is a spectrum

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,800
of different ways to land an

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,640
operating system on a platform also

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,079
the os images are tailored for the

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,399
application

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,240
the each application requires a bespoke

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,200
set of packages that have to be

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,480
uh tailored uh to land on the platform

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,880
so we need to account for that

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,399
in in how this system this ecosystem

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,680
works

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,160
and then finally the the

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,360
the incumbent projects here are you boot

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,720
for the firmware project

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,639
and device tree is the platform

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,079
description i mean this is a large

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,639
installed base

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,600
all of the socs have mature device free

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,480
support

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,639
um there is significant engineering

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,360
that's gone into the yubood ecosystem

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,320
and i mean it's also preferred by a lot

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,560
of us in the developer community

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,240
at this point someone will invariably

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,160
bring up well what about acpi why aren't

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,279
we just doing acpr

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,800
um and i mean the reality is is yes we

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,959
could use acpi

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,160
uh there is significant work going on to

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:27,360
bring up acpi on embedded socs

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,959
uh but the pragmatic view is at this

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,160
point in time acpi simply isn't

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,760
practical

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,600
uh there are a number of technical

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,519
challenges to bringing up a high quality

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,480
acpi implementation

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,120
uh so we don't want to get into a debate

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,440
of whether it's acpi or device tree

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,760
but for this particular band we're

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,760
saying device tree is the pragmatic and

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,920
supported solution that you can build

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,000
products right now with and so device

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,720
tree is what the system ready ir program

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
is based on

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,000
uh which i'm getting ahead of myself

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,320
because that's i was talking about

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,440
characteristics of the ecosystem

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,519
so system ready ir this one's again

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,560
tailored for embedded and here's the

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,360
vision of what we

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,600
want is regardless of what your device

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,480
is

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,480
along the bottom there regardless of how

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,800
you've designed your firmware

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,200
whether it's trusted firmware with you

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,320
boot into the user space and opti as a

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,480
trusted os or just users just you boot

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,480
in

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,760
in the normal world or tiana core in the

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
normal world

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,959
all of these are can present the same

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,839
interface

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,279
based on uefi and device tree up to the

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,760
os ecosystem

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,440
so that if you're landing yakto or one

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
of the bsds or one of the linux

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
distributions

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,040
all of those solutions can rely on

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,480
consistent behavior from the platform

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,320
and consistent description of the system

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,360
right uh and so we acknowledge that

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,160
while you boot

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
and as the primary implementation that's

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,120
going to be

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,600
used there is choice here on how that's

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,760
implemented and in fact if you implement

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,639
a system with uefi and device tree using

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,800
tiana core

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,040
or you've got an es or sr certified

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,360
system we're able to use those same

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,680
the same interfaces to be compliant with

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,680
ir

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
so let's go and talk about the specifics

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,240
on what exactly

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,760
is system ready ir and there's an

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,360
i've got seven points here and these are

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,399
the key elements that

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,720
make for a compliance system uh i'll go

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,639
through

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,000
these one by one first one is uefi uh

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,560
system ready ir is based on uefi and

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
there is a subset of uefi defined in the

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,959
ebbr

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
or embedded base boot requirements

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,160
document i'll have a link at the end of

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,760
the presentation

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,760
and that is a community developed

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,240
document with uh

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,120
that's been driven by linux developers

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,040
on

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,480
us and you move developers of a subset

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,519
of uefi that is implemented right now

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,639
and provides everything needed by the

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,160
opera by the

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,880
um majority distributions to boot on

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,959
on the platform right so what uefi

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,199
brings is it brings consistency

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,160
regard the problems we've had with

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,320
huboot in the past

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,920
is while that is a very healthy and

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,079
robust project

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,519
each platform that you lands on

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,720
implements things slightly different and

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,040
there's a

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,399
there's it's hard to get a single image

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,160
that's going to boot across the wide

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,639
variety of platforms

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,079
so by standardizing on uefi we have

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,160
consistent behavior

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,000
that also matches the behavior of other

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,639
uefi platforms in the arm ecosystem

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,480
second device tree and specifically

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,759
device tree that is provided by the

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,079
platform firmware

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,920
instead of carried along by the os and

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,759
so to be ir certified

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,680
you your firmware has to provide the

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,199
system description so that the os

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,360
doesn't need to carry that system

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,560
description along with it

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,480
um now you might argue i need to modify

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,040
my device tree well i'm going to replace

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,279
it

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,800
that's fine the os always has the option

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,040
to provide its own device tree

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,079
if that's your deployment model but for

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
compatibility

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,639
for system ir compliance we want to have

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,519
a default based device tree in the

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,000
platform

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,800
so that there's a fighting chance of the

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,360
os being able to boot

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,199
third this isn't really a characteristic

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,079
of system ready ir because we don't call

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,360
out ubud or

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,680
tfa but the practical reality is

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
everything for ir is implemented in ubud

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,160
and tfa

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,000
you don't need to go and rejig your

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,920
entire engineering process

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,360
what you can do instead is as long as

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,240
you're up to date on the

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,000
firmware projects you can turn on the

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,920
efi configuration

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,199
add the device tree to your platform and

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,079
you've got most of the things that you

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,440
need to be ir compliant

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,759
related to that a new addition to ebbr

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
is update capsule is required and what

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,399
update capsule does

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
well okay we'd arm i mean if we're

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,079
building secure always on connected

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,240
devices

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,199
in order for those always-on connected

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,039
devices to remain

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,720
always on connected and secure you

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,000
really need to be able to update all the

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
components and that includes the

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,919
firmware

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,280
but with traditional embedded stacks

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,720
each platform has

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,319
a slightly different way of updating

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,360
firmware and the os needs to know

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,720
details

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,360
on where it's supposed to write its

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,439
firmware what update capsule does is it

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,000
brings a consistent api

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,360
so that firmware knows how to write

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
firmware images to flash

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,520
and the operating system is able to

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,480
discover what firmware images are

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,720
available

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,559
with the esrt table and then use update

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,240
capsule to actually write it into the to

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,559
the system so this again provides that

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,120
consistency

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,720
um next compliance testing to be

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,080
certified we go through compliance

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
testing and we've got a process

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,440
that we work through we can work through

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,600
with you as our partners

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,640
on bringing your platform from enabling

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,880
all these features

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
testing yourself and then having us

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,799
confirm that and giving you a

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,799
certification

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,120
uh next one works with the octo project

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,799
again kind of like the ufo and tfa one

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,600
this isn't actually called out

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,640
in system ready ir but i really want to

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,360
highlight it

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,280
that this isn't just about binary

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,440
distros being able to work on embedded

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,200
socs this is also about

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,600
custom build yakto openwrt build root

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,320
or any other method that you use for for

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,520
building your

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,640
os and the key here is consistency

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,960
is you can build a yacht to image

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,200
that will very easily deploy on multiple

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,160
platforms without having to do

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,120
a separate image for each uh for each

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
platform

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,039
um there was a presentation on um on

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,799
tuesday

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,960
that called this specifically out that

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,559
having to build yocto images

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
for each and every platform is a very

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,679
expensive affair uh so

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,280
this you can build multi-platform images

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,320
with the octo quite easily

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,679
if everything is ir compliant um and

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,160
then the last one is that

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,039
you must test against top tier distros

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,400
the goal here

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,080
again is consistency compatibility

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,799
and we use the top tier distros as

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,640
evidence that the platform conforms

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,000
uh you might ask why do i even care

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,919
about that i plan to use

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,840
yakto or something else and do a custom

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
build which is totally fine

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,400
but in terms of certification we use the

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,080
top tier distros whether it be red hat

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,320
fedora suse or ubuntu

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,720
to provide evidence that these really

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,039
are conforming platforms

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,640
okay and then the last thing that i want

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,960
to bring up which isn't actually

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
it's not part of system ir proper but

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,200
there is kind of an add-on

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,280
uh certification that can be uh for

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
security or secure boot which is based

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,919
on the

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,559
um uh bpsr base boot security

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,480
requirements

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,480
document and this is if you implement

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,320
secure uefi secure boot

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,080
there is additional testing that we can

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,720
do to say that that is implemented

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,679
correctly this isn't required now but

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,320
really

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,760
iot connected devices need to be secure

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,840
so this is really important to pay

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,840
attention to

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,679
um and then this just shows that ir

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,960
it is part of the larger system rate

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,400
program these are not different

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
standards that we've just plucked out of

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
thin air

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,679
but across when you look at ir compared

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,840
with es and sr

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,280
they're all based on uefi they all run

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,760
on 64-bit arm

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,320
ir also gives you the option on 32-bit

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,280
where that's not so much on es and sr

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,760
um and then while ir is based on device

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,919
tree

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,600
es and sr are on acpi and sm bios

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,760
and that that is the most significant

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,679
difference between the two

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,679
um now it's also worth pointing out

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,520
and i've said this already once is that

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,440
between ir and es

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,200
there's actually quite a few socs that

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,159
can land in both cases

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,280
so which one you choose depends on what

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
you care about

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,799
if you care about embedded if you only

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,120
care about embedded linux

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,240
ir has lower requirements and it is

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,240
easier to implement

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,919
whereas es gives you access to a much

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,159
broader range of software

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,240
with windows and vmware as examples of

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,840
ones and enterprise linux

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,240
so that's the choice to make when you're

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,320
looking at certification

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,080
uh and as you can see we've got a number

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,720
we've already got quite a few partners

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,640
we have certified platforms under uh the

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,640
sr and es vans

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,240
uh we don't have any certified under ir

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,919
yet but that's because it's a new

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,280
program and so we're just

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,559
we're bringing that up now and you can

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,000
expect to see certification

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,000
announcements in the coming months

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,080
current status the documents that you

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,480
need are all really released

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,760
uh you can go to developer.org.com to

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,440
find out more

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,440
we've got some example platforms that we

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,520
are working on um

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,280
and we also are in the progress of

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,320
writing some how-to documentation on

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,919
actually implementing this

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,320
but most of what you need is already out

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,919
there in open source

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,600
um so to sum up we're spinning up the

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,440
certification program now

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,280
you can expect out announcements later

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,000
this year uh

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,400
join us on the ebbr community in github

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,840
or

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,880
uh contact us about certification at

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,039
systemreadyadarn.com

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,480
um and then i also just have to

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,200
highlight some of the sessions that have

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,559
already come up

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,679
at lunaro connect um there's been

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,200
sres and ir sessions on tuesday

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,120
uh i'm not sure when the recordings will

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,240
be up but you can go and look for those

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,200
um there was a case on uefi boot on iot

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
devices um standard firmware update and

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,360
also

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,640
the generic image approach on the ledge

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,240
reference platform which leverages an ir

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,760
and that is that so are there any

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,280
questions i see one um

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,880
so is is the sr ir requires device for

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,559
your tolerance device so i already

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,280
talked about that that we've got

00:22:52,559 --> 00:23:01,120
device tree is required um

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
i'm just checking anything else

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,200
so i am not uh

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
nice

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,799
okay and it looks like there's been some

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,799
answers to questions right now

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,480
um okay uh francoise you mentioned ebv

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,000
art snacks

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,159
does not require specific system

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,360
description language that is correct so

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,799
ebbr

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,240
is acpi or device tree and that is fine

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,640
but for the system ready ir

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,280
certification program

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,960
we are specifically requiring device

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
tree because that's what that ecosystem

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
is

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,600
is expecting um if you have acpi in your

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
platform

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,360
rather than doing an ir certification uh

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,360
we're i mean we're encouraging you to go

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,400
and look at an es certification because

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,200
that gives you access

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,640
to a wider range of os's and presumably

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,760
that's why you would have implemented

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,720
acpi

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,320
the reason that language is in ebbr is

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,480
we want to make sure that it's possible

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,840
to build a system that is both

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
ir and es compatible

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
uh

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,120
and i think

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,720
uh i think that is it i'm not seeing any

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,640
other

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,039
oh one more so generic ir compliant

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,440
yocto image presumably that means all

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,159
bb append and various sfc bsp layers

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,000
that

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,400
patch all manner of things need to go

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,799
away um

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,240
there is a meta arm if you're that

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,600
should that we're looking at

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,840
making sure it implements everything

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,000
that's needed um

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,559
i don't know enough about the yakuto

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,559
layers to answer that specifically

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,480
but yes if you're building a generic

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,080
image you would want to do away with

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,720
anything that is

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,919
exclusive for a single platform and try

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,039
to add on pieces

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,120
into that and of that i am out of time

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,559
so i'm going to say thank you very much

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,840
and enjoy the

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,840
last day of connect

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
