★ Session Summary ★
The SKS/KeyGen2 project is about establishing an security architecture, provisioning and management scheme for cryptographic keys targeting a wide variety of applications including on-line banking, payments, e-government access, and enterprise login.  A TEE (possibly aided by a local security processor) is a core component of the envisioned architecture.  In order to enable easy enrollment, a browser-based provisioning protocol is another core component.  Since a cryptographic key (unlike a file), usually represents a relationship to a remote party which also typically imply a policy for ""their"" keys, the system supports key ACLs which through an OS/TEE layer governs which applications a key may be used with.   A consequence of this arrangement is that cryptographic keys become first-class OS objects like files.  The protocol and basic key store is already running as an application which is used for testing and evaluation. What's missing is the OS/TEE/Browser integration, something which requires a set of rather different
