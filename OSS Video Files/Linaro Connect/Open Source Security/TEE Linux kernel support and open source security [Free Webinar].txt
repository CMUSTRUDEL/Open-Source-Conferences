TEE security infrastructure is now upstream in the Linux kernel, thanks to the hard work of many people in the ARM open source ecosystem. In this upcoming webinar, Joakim Bech and Jens Wiklander of the Linaro Security Working Group explain:

‚Ä£ Why upstream Linux kernel driver support is an important milestone.
‚Ä£ The relationship with specifications such as GlobalPlatform.
‚Ä£ A recap of the design principles for the TEE driver.
‚Ä£ How to get involved with TEE development.

This webinar is based on the work of the Linaro Security Working Group. Their work helps Linaro achieve its mission of providing upstream open source support for the ARM ecosystem. The webinar will be of interest to developers and engineering managers who would like the latest status on TEE support in Linux, particularly those looking to develop secure applications with e.g. OP-TEE. It‚Äôs also a great case study for those interested in the challenges of Linux kernel upstreaming. There will be the opportunity to ask questions before, during and after the webinar.

üéô Speakers:
Joakim Bech, Security Working Group Tech Lead, Linaro
Jens Wiklander, Security Working Group Engineer & Upstream Driver Author, Linaro‚Äã

Introduction to OP-TEE
--
A great introduction to OP-TEE security written from the standpoint of Automotive Grade Linux. It's only 13 slides with some great diagrams explaining trusted execution, secure boot and isolation.

OP-TEE for Beginners and Porting Review
--
Explains the building blocks involved in Security including TrustZone, OP-TEE, Trusted Firmware etc. Goes into detail on how Secure Boot Works.. and Why. Explains how a simple secure Trusted Application interacts with OP-TEE and works. Brief overview on how to port OP-TEE to an ARM platform. Opens discussions for Potential Challenges and Hardware limitations and how they can be overcome.

Raspberry Pi3, OP-TEE and JTAG debugging
--
ARM TrustZone is a critical technology for securing IoT devices and systems. But awareness of TrustZone and its benefits lags within the maker community as well as among enterprises. The first step to solving this problem is lowering the cost of access. Sequitur Labs and Linaro have joined forces to address this problem by making a port of OP-TEE available on the Raspberry Pi 3. The presentation covers the value of TrustZone for securing IoT and how customers can learn more through this joint effort.

A Gentle Introduction to Trusted Execution and OP-TEE
--
Smart connected devices such as mobile phones, tablets and Digital TVs are required to handle data with strong security and confidentiality requirements. A ‚ÄúTrusted Execution Environment‚Äù (TEE) provides an environment for processing data securely, protected from normal platform applications. This talk is intended as an introduction to Trusted Execution, and the open-source Trusted Execution Environment OP-TEE in particular. It introduces the GlobalPlatform TEE Specifications, explains how Trusted Execution is implemented by ARM TrustZone and OP-TEE, and outlines how trusted boot software manages the secure boot of an ARM platform. Finally, it gives some pointers on how to get started with OP-TEE.
