Description: 
	Abstract
The post-K is the successor of the Japanese flagship supercomputer, K.
RIKEN and Fujitsu have developed a new Arm-SVE enabled processor,
called A64FX, for the Post-K system. The processor is designed for
energy-efficiency and sustained application performance. The system
will be installed in the next year. In this talk, the features and
some preliminary performance of the post-K system will be presented,
as well as the schedule of the project and supported software.

	00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,950
so today

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:17,920
talk about our project about

00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:20,740
machine so our became the center for the

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,910
convenience science is the main body to

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:28,149
run our Japanese national flagship

00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:35,410
machine called the K computer ok

00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:40,989
computer is the supercomputer which has

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:46,840
star the child Peter probes so we got

00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:50,500
the top plan in the 2011 that is the

00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:55,300
seven years ago but still there this

00:00:50,500 --> 00:01:00,180
machine is the very active so and still

00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:04,839
help regulate the hormones in the graph

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:11,850
processing and HPCC is the conjugate

00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:14,710
gradient the competition so and we have

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:20,590
still we have with good moments in a

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:25,899
year application so flagship 2020

00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:31,679
project is that have the mission to

00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:34,600
build the japanese frank machine which I

00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:38,530
interpret tentatively called the poster

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:42,969
K that is the codename so currently we

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:47,289
are Kofu a name for this computer so the

00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:51,850
training is this week so if you're

00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:57,299
interested in presa to give the name so

00:01:51,850 --> 00:02:01,329
and not just our development of the

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,639
system so the mission is including our

00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:07,869
development of the wide range of

00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:12,810
application which is running on our

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:17,170
machine so that is expected to be useful

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:23,860
to solve the social and the science

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:25,780
issues in Japan so front budget is total

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:35,709
front budget Easter

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:38,620
almost 1.11 1 billion US dollars so it's

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:44,319
included research and development and

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:47,920
manufacturing of the system and of

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:52,450
course is included that abroad meant of

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:57,700
the application so project is on I

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:59,860
tracked this so and they can is the in

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,739
charge of the development of the

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:06,970
decision and which is a vendor partner

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,920
so for the application

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,989
our government is identified the

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:19,350
important issue to solve to be solved in

00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:23,970
this supercomputer so this is the 9

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:27,910
priority issues which is identified in

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:35,110
complement committees so from drug

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:39,400
discovery and medicine and this is the

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:46,450
social health center of young ability so

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:56,859
and next one is the register probation

00:03:46,450 --> 00:04:00,570
and climate and that these the issues is

00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:03,489
related to the energy problem and

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:08,430
industry competitiveness and basic

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:18,430
science so in addition to this that in

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:24,520
June 2016 so for the topics is worse the

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:27,400
audited so first one is that agent-based

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,930
simulation to solve that social

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,690
phenomenon social economic phenomena and

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:37,220
rushman is that related to the brain

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:45,000
science and

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:46,500
so and now we have that this is the time

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,460
rhino tower project

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,760
so and we are now in the end of the

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,760
design and implementation phases so from

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:05,310
then from this summer so we are going to

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:11,330
move to the manufacturing of the system

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:15,890
and we have planned to installation from

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:21,480
the beginning over the next year and

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:25,530
after the one years test and adjustment

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:31,130
so we are going to start public services

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:35,960
from the spring of that 2021 so and

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:39,270
again status and update is that we are

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:44,460
end of now end of the design and in the

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:47,250
implementation phase and from otta the

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,610
summer obtained last year we have to

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:55,500
first foot prototype chip first seconds

00:05:50,610 --> 00:06:00,440
and now we are testing the second

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:06,060
version of the prototype so and we are

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:08,940
now is working on a common separation

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,470
that tuning by thus images in the

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:17,910
compiler so architectures I'm going to

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:23,610
detail with about architectures so this

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:28,380
is just a brief overview the instruction

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:32,270
set is the on the create plus scale of

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:38,040
relaxation so I think this is the chip

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:42,419
the first chip which had SP so and the

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:45,150
number core is that 48 press some

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:48,570
additional course for learning the

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,680
operating system and interesting things

00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:54,330
is that

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:59,010
the memory is the HBM so no Didier

00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:08,190
so memory and chip is packaged in one

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:13,530
that that chip so and and because of the

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:17,669
very careful design for the energy and

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:20,970
the power saving we can achieve 15 euros

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:24,060
per watt for the Digium kernel that is I

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,910
think of all times almost protons

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:34,530
efficiency and the current existing

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:39,870
other Xeon processors so the attack at

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:43,830
the beginning of the project we set 3

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:47,490
KPI so key-keeper homeless indicators so

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:52,100
one is the extreme power efficient

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:57,770
system that mean that the our facilities

00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:02,220
capacity power capacity is limited to 30

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:05,970
to the 40 megawatt this is the browse

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:10,169
enough but to make a large system this

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:14,130
is the kind of dream mutation so second

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:20,190
one is that we don't target it to the

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:24,110
benchmark so we want to their

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:31,500
performance in a dear application and

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:34,140
the we expect the hundred times worse

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,339
than the current K computer in some

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:41,099
application so that means k computer is

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:45,420
computer which have the 10 theta probes

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:51,060
and that mean that 100 times faster than

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:52,610
a computer that is our definition of the

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,070
exascale

00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:00,210
computer the restaurant is the easy to

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:04,110
to use other character the features

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:08,460
mean the hello computer is a shared of

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:13,980
facilities by the researchers in Japan

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:21,480
so this system must be easy to use for

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:24,209
everybody so this is the detail the as I

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:30,839
said the instruction set is the um

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:35,910
precise ve so and the brains of the

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:40,080
simile is the 512 bit sim D and the two

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:46,290
pipes so in a number course 248 for the

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:50,100
computation and 2 for 2 cores or full

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,380
chorus delegates to run the operating

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,480
system so this is important for the

00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:00,420
super computer to the new type of

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:07,459
operating system cheetah so and the

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:12,330
memory is the HBM so packages in in same

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:18,540
in the same package in the chip and we

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:23,940
are using the 32 kilobyte HB me too so

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:30,000
one die is size is the ATO by that mean

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:33,300
that we have for HB m hmm to start that

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,110
mean the total memory capacity is the 32

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:44,130
gigabyte so and 42 core is divided for

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:48,779
four groups we called the core memory

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:51,600
groups it means that the 12 course each

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:55,610
two are at Viterbo core is sharing the

00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:00,510
l2 system l2 cache the shared cache and

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:04,050
the memory so so that the course and the

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:08,310
editor cache and memory is the consist

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:13,310
the one group so it's kind of the numa

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:16,610
node so and these are the crust result

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:19,610
the group is connected by the network

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,720
corn chip so and the nitrous network on

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:28,780
chip is supporting the shared memory

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:34,010
protocol that means that we can use the

00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:39,110
48 rate open p program to use the 48

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:41,540
course together so and that the silicon

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:46,040
technologies what this trip is the seven

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:51,940
nanometers that's prepared and they're

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:57,530
opera logic design so which achieved the

00:11:51,940 --> 00:12:01,250
1500 watt in the teacher and at this

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:06,650
moment we confirm that more than two

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:10,460
point seven probes at a DVM Connor at a

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:14,150
peak Mohammed and 90% efficiency of the

00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:19,160
deserved honor the memory bandwidth so

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:22,910
each HB m 2 is provided 250 gigabyte per

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,620
second in a total this system the

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,940
memories boundaries is the one track

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,970
almost want red light

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:37,330
so this bandwidth is a very comparable

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:41,330
to the Porter in octal any video so and

00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:46,400
to wearest common scenario application

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:48,290
the ratio altered fight the memory

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,390
boundaries and the proxies are very

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:59,570
important so we keep the white backdrop

00:12:52,390 --> 00:13:04,300
ratio approximately points for so this

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,300
number is not very good for application

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:17,260
so honestly so I don't I don't have to

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,260
say the detail of this V so V is

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:26,790
new sympathy instruction for the hi

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,200
pumpkin fitting so an interesting

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:32,040
feature is the vector of agnostic

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,760
characteristics that mean that the

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,420
instruction set is independent

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:44,190
independent from the picture rings so

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:50,010
you know Intel the simile is we except X

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:54,270
2 or the FX 5 5 5 12

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:57,000
so the according to the vector rings

00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,670
that the inter is using the different

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,100
instruction set additional instruction

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:08,750
set but this SB is providing very

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:15,390
uniform and the same instruction set for

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:18,990
different vector rings so and this is

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:22,880
the kind of example if this is taken

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:26,070
from the dom is for informational

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:31,530
website so comparing to the square

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:35,520
Scarah code and it's recode the we don't

00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:41,760
have to we don't need any the prorogue

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:46,950
and April that the because of the very

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:49,400
strong the political capabilities of

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,400
text me

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:05,509
okay so and again the the chips the core

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:12,369
is grouped in a core memory groups so

00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:15,860
this is that is we configure addition in

00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:22,040
SMG configuration the turbo core is

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:25,100
sharing other l2 cache so its core

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:30,980
health just l1 cache and a little castle

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:38,470
shale gas and beyond the editor cache we

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:46,160
have each VM - so this figure shows then

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:48,920
the bandwidth for each it's the

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,660
connection between their to catch the

00:15:48,920 --> 00:16:01,519
ATM - and l1 cache today - Cassie and

00:15:52,660 --> 00:16:09,949
everyone cash today today - core so

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:15,709
again the the between so within the

00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:19,839
Zener is the same G so this is just on

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:23,209
the uniform memory shell memory but

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:28,480
between the same G so we have to force

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:34,459
mg in a chip so this is the new so and

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:39,850
the paternal Numa the the boundary

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:44,679
sister 150 abide by dictionary this is

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:50,389
enough to the shared memory between

00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:53,760
between the core so this is the diagram

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:59,089
of the pipeline pipeline of

00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:02,579
the hardship so I don't I am no time

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,770
enough time to explain this teacher but

00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:08,280
the important thing is is that we have

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:12,750
two pipes for the 505 hundred twelve

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:20,100
remedy so FAA and it will be is at a

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:24,120
pipe for Cindy pipe so in a

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:29,750
supercomputer so interconnect is also a

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:36,870
very important so in computer the heat

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:41,280
has developed in a very low latency the

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:45,090
high bandwidth of the interconnect so we

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,760
are using the same topology and same

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,940
technologies but a little bit enhanced

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,870
at the time of the K computer the

00:17:50,940 --> 00:18:02,040
bandwidth is 5 gigabyte per second for

00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:06,059
the link but now the new post K the

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,880
interconnect is 6.8 cubed but they can't

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:18,320
buy water link so this is little bit

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:26,100
first time so an addition to this we

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:29,520
hunt the dma engine for from the cpu

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:33,090
between the CPU and the network so the

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,860
imaging is called t nos so totally in a

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:43,890
network interface so number 13 I is

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:48,750
increased from 4 to 6 so because that so

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:52,740
that injection bandwidth is increase so

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,400
and criminal performance in a very

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,870
second

00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:01,049
so we confirm the by by the rear second

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:07,620
we confirm the 2.5 recruits by D

00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:10,650
Gymkhana and also the 5/8 800

00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,799
you know byte per second and still in

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:21,929
bench block so this is the compression

00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:27,419
to the to the future the previous

00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:32,669
machine the fx100 so this is the chip

00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:34,919
two chip two chip compression so as you

00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:39,750
can see the comparing to the previous

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:43,730
one we can achieve almost C or C two

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:49,429
photons per than the previous one in

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:52,919
application so CFD and sesame curve wave

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:57,210
propagation so and the interesting since

00:19:52,919 --> 00:20:00,409
things is that the SB hey stop

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:05,220
they're good features for other

00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:12,440
different so it support large medical

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:18,120
type II 16 so the using these features

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:21,779
FP 16 the calculation and into the 8 bit

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,799
integers so we expect much improvement

00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:33,539
of the different Conner in this

00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:36,720
processor so and this is the new new

00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:41,580
information taupe and the comparison to

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:46,500
the our top escape processors to the

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:50,370
Tetra and Interzone so thanks to the

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:54,179
great the memory bandwidth of the HTM -

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:57,899
so comparing to the town so we can

00:20:54,179 --> 00:21:01,049
achieve very good moments in the human

00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:05,610
of benchmark this is the CFD benchmark

00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:13,610
and very very a memory intensive

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:17,960
application so again the thanks to and

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:19,879
hi memory bandwidth and so we can

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:27,259
achieve the good Palmas you know you

00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:31,820
know this kind of application so and so

00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:36,409
know per design in the power management

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:39,980
we have several other switches to switch

00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:43,730
on the capabilities of the many parts

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:49,039
that we call the Pavano so interesting

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:55,399
power knob is that receipt of the one

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:58,820
pipe among the two pipes so the every

00:21:55,399 --> 00:22:00,320
only is that the mode which is using

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,950
just on the vampire

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,950
so this pollen of is a very efficient to

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:16,029
pour ropers in the memory palace

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,859
intensive application so that is because

00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:22,100
we have if we have the two pipes

00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:26,239
we need more standard standard standby

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:31,220
powers to make use of the two pipes

00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:36,320
other immediately but if we can switch

00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:41,239
off the one pipe then we can reduce the

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:44,779
standby power this is this is this

00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:54,679
function it is contribute much for

00:22:44,779 --> 00:23:01,460
saving the power so again the KPI so we

00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:04,789
can achieve the memory very the power

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:10,850
efficiency there especially in the

00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:13,279
Gymkhana and we confirm that hundred

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:18,350
times faster than the current cook

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:23,419
current computer and immediate location

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:26,990
called the Genesis and Annie can educate

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:31,820
tkf that is the climate simulation

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:38,480
destination are the application and the

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:41,929
rustman is that the unfortunately or

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:46,820
fortunately we have no accelerator so

00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:49,429
that mean that we can use just the

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,980
shared memory programming we don't need

00:23:49,429 --> 00:24:01,730
any the programming effort for

00:23:51,980 --> 00:24:04,730
accelerators so this is the the the the

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,490
implementation of the lock and board so

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:13,040
this is chip this is the interesting so

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:16,400
you can see the hmm to is test this

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,140
slide and for and in the middle this is

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,140
the chip for - ep

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:31,580
so and this is the compression or apply

00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:38,660
advices from the K computer soak a

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:41,630
computer is installed in 2011 that means

00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:45,650
that I think seven new work five years

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:48,770
ago so it's almost ten years so this is

00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:54,640
the ten years at once so and the number

00:24:48,770 --> 00:25:04,670
of course is that 80 to 48 so and chips

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:08,300
is point 128 gigabytes per surface here

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:12,890
by a gear up to the 2.7 that that mean

00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:16,730
that I think is available we have 21

00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:20,450
times faster so and recently we

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:27,410
announced that a number of the node in a

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:32,660
system so it's s modern and 150,000 node

00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:35,830
so that means the if you think of the

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:39,570
number of course so we are going to have

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:46,580
seven point billion course in the system

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:50,820
this is not same master and GPU so 7.5

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:55,679
general-purpose support so this is I

00:25:50,820 --> 00:26:04,229
think this is the great so we skipped

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:09,049
this Torino and if it is supporting to

00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:12,779
the main HPC application so it is

00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:14,580
already have reported improving our

00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:32,429
application but we need some

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:39,239
modification like this ok so and so I

00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:43,019
said now so as I said from the beginning

00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:46,440
of the next year we are going to install

00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:49,919
the system so and we have a front to

00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:54,919
re-access program in spring of the next

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:57,809
year and operation will be studied from

00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:03,389
spring of the next next year that means

00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:06,749
that is bringing up the 2021 so this is

00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:10,200
summary so the memory boundaries is a

00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:16,529
very important practice in HPC processes

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:18,389
so we are using the HBM too so and this

00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:21,539
is the good for the deep running

00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:25,979
application and we are carefully

00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:29,340
designed to reduce the power and we are

00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:34,229
very happy to cooperate with some

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:38,669
communities so we are expecting the

00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:43,139
contribute and the god help from the

00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:47,820
communities for building the ecosystem

00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:50,860
update each arm HPC and the restaurant

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:55,320
is that we don't have

00:27:50,860 --> 00:28:02,890
any actuators but thanks to the SBE

00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:07,510
especially for the efi 16 and and 8.8

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:10,630
bit the integer simile instructions that

00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:15,310
we are expecting more speed-up over the

00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:18,600
deep running application so thank you

00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,600
for your attention

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,939
