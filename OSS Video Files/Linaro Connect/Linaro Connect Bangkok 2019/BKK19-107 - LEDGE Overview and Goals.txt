	00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:14,110
and so we're supposed to talk about

00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:18,250
leading edge topics so hopefully my mind

00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:20,590
will still work a little bit so the

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,520
first thing is I would like to spend

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,520
some time not too much on what is edge

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,470
for Lennar oh we had a lot of

00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:36,519
conversations almost a year ago about

00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:38,980
what is the what is edge what is the if

00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:41,130
we do a group about edge computing what

00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:46,420
will be its scope

00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:49,960
and for about a year we've been working

00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:54,370
hard in really notifying the use cases

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,610
and what other relevant technologies so

00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,199
today we have a group that is producing

00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:03,760
a reference platform we talked about

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,610
that integrating technologies and here

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,280
is a little bit of history of how our

00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,320
sea computing models where edge

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,150
computing is just one of those competing

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:21,520
models I take some Liberty about the

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:24,520
technical correctness just for the for

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:36,250
the sake of the change in stretching the

00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:42,189
ideas so I'm old enough that I I did

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:46,299
that so I went through all of those

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:48,670
things and through the the idea is that

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:52,329
when we started to have distributed

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,909
computing all at a sudden everything had

00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,770
to be distributed computing as well as

00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,619
when

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,260
relational databases appeared everything

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,650
when was to be

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,080
national database I think the computing

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,500
mothers are is the same and we tried to

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,180
fit in that same edge computing for

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,400
computing many things that have nothing

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:22,380
to do but that's an easy way to to a big

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:26,880
bag to talk to put too much things so

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,010
when I consider the Internet the

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,170
mainframe model because ultimately you

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,160
have one device your smart phone the

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,320
internet doctor what it is regardless of

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,270
how it is built this is one single thing

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:47,010
that you use and so that's where I say I

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:49,860
kind of it may be exactly technically

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,080
correct but if we try to summarize

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,709
things that maybe not too far from

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,110
reality a big thing that happened was

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,080
peer-to-peer computing where really that

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,790
was a new model where there were no

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,470
distributed computing per se because

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,420
there was no organization it was

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,600
self-organizing networks of computers

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,020
that were doing something and

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:18,390
particularly giving us access to movies

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:21,630
and so edge computing here started a few

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:24,510
years ago from let's say the network

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,360
operators they said if we have to

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,640
distribute those movies to all those

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,510
smart phones we will have a problem so

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:37,800
we will stick some cash systems closer

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:40,800
to the users so at that moment this was

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:45,450
the first instance of edge computing and

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:49,920
then if we go a little bit beyond people

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:53,570
started to think well if we do that it

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:58,220
may be difficult to deploy for 1 billion

00:03:53,570 --> 00:04:02,910
devices so how we do it

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:07,290
so the initial etsy LED edge computing

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:11,190
was very simple you have that's the edge

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,569
of the telecom network you have your

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,640
smartphone and

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:19,940
there is a box that's sitting right in

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,639
the in the line of the edge that serves

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:30,240
the request as closest the user so

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:33,449
that's simple but if I said if you have

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,229
1 billion mobile subscribers this model

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:38,990
looks good but it's not operationally

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:42,720
valuable so how do we make it really

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:46,500
feasible so that you start to have a

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,380
number of layers where you aggregate a

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:54,169
little bit the data first and then you

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:58,979
it's really a CDN network with an edge

00:04:54,169 --> 00:05:02,669
and so there is a project in Linux

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:06,210
Foundation to make some clarity of this

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,250
specific use case which says this is how

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,259
we name things so there is the device

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,410
edge there is the infrastructure edge

00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:21,150
there is so now we start to have a

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:25,110
common language but if we push the ball

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:32,599
a little bit further then this is too

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:32,599
hierarchical this is too traditional and

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,030
you may want to deliver value even if

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:43,349
you don't have any cloud you want to

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,960
have some form of a reduced cloud that

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:49,080
would provide services to the

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,139
smartphones to the windmills to the

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:57,120
factory the apps and samba lines in a

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:58,650
way where there is no cloud at all and

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,260
then you may have also a lot of

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,620
peer-to-peer communications at different

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:10,710
levels between the nodes that constitute

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:13,500
those is fog and you see I I picture a

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:18,990
cloud edge a things edge and you have

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:21,840
systems at both sides of the edge so all

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,370
although I don't know the name of the

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,850
color

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:30,400
violet purple so all those vionnet's

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,560
friends over here

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,100
sometimes pronouncing your french word

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,199
in English works but sometimes no I

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:44,050
should have known that my wife is in the

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,940
fashion industry so anyways so you see

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,570
there is no edge where you do not have

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:55,540
anymore one system that sits at the edge

00:06:49,570 --> 00:07:00,710
edge is a form of I said administrative

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:04,729
frontier barrier limit and you have

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:10,310
systems that sit on one side or the

00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:13,040
other so if we think of edge computing

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,440
because it is defined now well it is not

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:20,720
defined anymore because it it covers all

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:26,060
those aspects it covers the systems that

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:28,460
are still in in in the things area the

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,850
things domain but that communicate with

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,979
the first system in the phone

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:37,729
each node in the phone can be considered

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:40,880
as an edge node and you can have edge

00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:45,320
nodes at the different side of the cloud

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,450
edge some companies called that the far

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,419
edge so typically in the telecom

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:58,310
industry took all that forage for

00:07:50,419 --> 00:08:03,349
example and for the sake of simplicity I

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:05,300
would say edge and fold its I think it

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,099
is becoming irrelevant in trying to

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,470
define exactly what it is this is a

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:12,650
number of systems of different sizes

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:17,200
that collaborate not in a hierarchical

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:23,800
way to be able to deliver services as

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,800
fast as a cheapest possible

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:33,620
when when aspect of this is that I could

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,450
now I start to call it ubiquitous

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,539
computing and trying to do the marketing

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:43,280
guy which means that you will have

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:45,980
computing power maybe in your chair here

00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:54,350
and that can be considered as the edge

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:57,050
of the room for example the other the

00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:00,640
next aspect is swarm computing so this

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:04,520
is how nodes can collaborate in

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:10,660
communities that are built dynamically

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:14,540
when simple example is windmills with

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,270
plenty of will mean farms plant with

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,940
plenty of windmills some that go and

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:23,750
maintenance some on there so you can

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:27,530
have a community of the active with

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:30,980
means you can think of cow platoons on

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,500
highway so you may have twenty cars that

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,460
have nothing in common except that

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:40,700
they're speeding on the highway together

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:44,330
and then if you have an intersection of

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,700
two streets you can have two swarms

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,690
two coupla tunes that are crossing and

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:54,170
those two platoons those two swarms are

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,540
collaborating to make sure that all cars

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:01,520
pass the intersection as fast as

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:04,640
possible so that is swarm computing it

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,740
is based on it is building on edge

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,740
competing as a computing model

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,350
confidential computing will be related

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,680
again to end computing because that's

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,960
just an extension of that if you think

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,430
of insurance companies that will have

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:29,120
those cars electric cars autonomous

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,820
driving cars they we want to make sure

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,889
that they have all the information

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,529
available in

00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:38,889
of an accident and then we want to make

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:43,449
sure that nobody can tamper with the

00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:45,989
laws so how can they do that because

00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:48,670
they don't want let's say your Tesla

00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:52,119
name brands but they don't want the car

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:57,540
manufacturer or the the system

00:10:52,119 --> 00:11:00,850
integrator to be able to change that so

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,639
the insurance company may have an

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,309
application that will sit in the car but

00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,220
that nobody will be able to access

00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,720
including the system administrator so

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,439
that the logs produced by this

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,059
application becomes totally and tamper

00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:19,049
rebel or at least that if they are

00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:22,959
tampered with somebody will detect that

00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:27,119
and it will be like a void if warranty

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,119
void if that logs have been tampered

00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:36,669
guest computing is an another layer and

00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:40,799
let's imagine an application at the

00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:45,579
Olympics which is fine fine lost child

00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:50,079
so anyone participating or looking at

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:52,569
the the Olympics could download an

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,439
application on their smartphone and then

00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:59,259
they will they will just do a 360 view

00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:03,429
of what's what's around and their phone

00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:07,360
will be participating - finding the

00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:11,470
child yet this application they have

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,999
downloaded shall have no right to do

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,519
anything with the other apps with

00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:17,379
content with anything they will be just

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,759
given the opportunity to use the

00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:24,910
hardware to get the video feed to the

00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:29,459
face matching and report so you're

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:33,279
you're hosting a guest application

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:38,189
voluntarily but by default it's really

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,189
not accepting any other

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,840
it is confined it needs on an

00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,680
environment so edge computing really is

00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:51,460
the basis of all those changes that are

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:59,170
kind of happening everything at the same

00:12:51,460 --> 00:13:02,410
time when one key aspect of what this is

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:05,590
about to change is the way we we

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:09,760
exchange between applications so there

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:14,250
is when well there is a few ways to do

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,250
that with publish/subscribe models and

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,470
what I call real time building balls

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:24,000
that is a way to share data in real time

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:26,650
so that multiple applications can

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,360
collaborate if you think of the

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,850
traditional mesh in distributed

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,300
computing when you have too many systems

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,160
collaborating this isn't any - any

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:40,540
communication these dot have the bounded

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,600
way to find find a solution so data

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:48,300
models in addition to computing models

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:52,270
are going to change I want to talk about

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:56,950
the security and Trust except that which

00:13:52,270 --> 00:14:00,970
is imagine the car today a thief can get

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:03,880
about connect the Box to the to the car

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:08,860
and have the car create a car key for

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:11,440
you the car is just authenticating the

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,400
the box to be a genuine box to create

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,300
car keys

00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:20,290
it is not verifying that you have the

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,990
right to do it so in conjunction with

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,450
what happens to this computing model

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:30,010
which have an impact on the data models

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:33,010
there will be also a change in how Trust

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,650
is built and trustworthiness of

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,530
persistence is going to be a challenge

00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,680
because it's not about stacking security

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,530
components in the system that will get

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,190
the process secure the process itself

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:51,150
has to be secure the process of creating

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:55,610
a car key has to be secure

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,610
with a number of enabling technologies

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:05,630
so having said that if we try to make it

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:10,380
a little bit more concrete

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:12,990
there will be sensors actuators that

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,450
will be controlling let's say things

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,990
that will be things themselves and then

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:22,620
really that will be a first layer as

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:24,060
controllers and there may be different

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,640
levels of aggregation

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,010
the more you go on the right the more

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,760
you're getting closer to data center

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:36,000
technologies but between those two edges

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,810
the cloud edge and the things edge those

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,370
systems share a common set of

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,110
requirements in terms of security in

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:47,220
terms of technologies that have to be

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:49,170
present and that's what the ledge cook

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,670
the dinner alleged computing group is

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:56,720
doing we are creating reference platform

00:15:53,670 --> 00:16:02,279
that contain all the Niblick enabling

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:04,020
technologies to create edge products the

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,140
form of those edge products can range

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:12,080
from a downsized version of a data

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:20,310
center to some devices so I don't see if

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:26,510
there is is there somebody from yes did

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:33,500
you show it so that is an edge device

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:37,589
powered by HD that's an SD 32 MP 1

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,360
mistaken that's an edge device so I'm

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,370
not saying that you're running the ledge

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,830
reference platform hopefully you are but

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:48,089
I don't know but the older technology

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:51,470
you may need to build the software will

00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:54,350
be facilitated leveraging the

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:59,450
we do if you want more I think you have

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:00,860
a session on on Wednesday so you will be

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,850
dealing with the details of the

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:10,480
technologies at least here you have a

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:13,820
positioning where it's really about

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,600
trust of the whole process not just

00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:19,970
stacking security secure boot is one one

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:27,740
aspect but just a little aspect of

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:30,490
security now at the edge the application

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:34,730
development is also something different

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:37,340
typically you will have run run times

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,640
that will accept modules and will

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:43,370
customize those modules will create

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,340
custom modules but ultimately all the

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:49,690
logic is coming from the runtime so

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,820
that's if you have heard about else AP

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:55,550
wrote for the enterprise applications

00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:00,230
basically the application exists and you

00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:02,420
just tweak it to your needs and edge is

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,200
doing that direction so you have a

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:10,480
number of runtimes like edge X TIBCO s

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:14,150
AP yo T V T microsoft azure IOT runtime

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:18,290
those are the environment on which you

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:21,530
run your applications and the goal of

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:24,320
the LED reference platform is to tie

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:30,080
those runtimes with the underlying

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:33,080
hardware in a way that the runtime can

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,680
leverage all the hardware capabilities

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,080
accelerators in a transparent way and so

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,800
that the guys that built the solutions

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:46,850
on top of leveraging those runtimes have

00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,560
very simple time to use the SOC that is

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,170
good for the product range

00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:55,400
so when product can range from a very

00:18:51,170 --> 00:19:01,850
small to large product you want to use

00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:11,119
the same software across those SOC sizes

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:13,029
to simplify your go-to-market so what we

00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:17,779
say on one side you have eight runtimes

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:20,840
coming from Hawaii for example and I'm

00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:22,999
not sure if it's yet public but

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:28,279
hopefully this will be announced but

00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:30,830
what we is using the the late runtime

00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:34,389
the register reference platform for the

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:37,239
product and there are a number of target

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:42,399
organizations so that we will facilitate

00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:45,470
their jobs to create their product and

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:49,549
so we've focused on systems that are

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:54,099
ebbr compliant and we plan to work

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:57,289
essentially on TSN and trust extensions

00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:59,059
to the regular Linux implementation so

00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:02,659
for example today secure boot is not

00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:03,609
ready with new boot we will make that

00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,320
happen

00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:09,139
tell me there are a lot of additional

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:15,080
topics that that will be covered by the

00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:19,059
ledge reference platform and I think I'm

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,059
ready for some questions

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,870
this

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:40,190
on your list of as frameworks I didn't

00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:59,270
see and with some green growth know I'm

00:20:40,190 --> 00:21:04,180
a very bad marketing guy very good where

00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:13,460
does TFA and opti fit into your your

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:15,670
story so for you if our channel core

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,490
there has been some technologies

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:23,780
implemented related to TFA standalone

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:26,240
mmm and additional technologies to be

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:29,300
able to implement secure boot on channel

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:36,710
core for on servers we are going to

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:39,590
leverage that to do the same on those

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,960
environments yet it is a little bit more

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,480
complex because the way it is

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:49,310
implemented today for servers prevent

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,880
opti to run or prevent the creation of a

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:57,590
firmware TPM for example so we won't

00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:01,000
secure boot to coexist with opti

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:04,400
applications like non reputable nodes

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,200
and with additional applications as a

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:11,780
firmware TPM so there is building blocks

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,030
that are present and we plan to leverage

00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,030
those to go a step further

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:28,660
but doing it UEFI not doing it negative

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:37,360
ATM I may not understand your question

00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:39,340
could use it again differently so you

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,780
have your problem and then your next

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:47,170
stage would be for example firmware so

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,360
where it is

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:53,350
you're not saying I'm trusted firmware

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:58,270
than you're saying you yes I'm saying

00:22:53,350 --> 00:23:01,150
UEFI as a as a standard interface so you

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:05,980
if I can't be implemented with channel

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:10,770
core with XYZ and with you boot we plan

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:14,020
to add so you boot has UEFI

00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:16,630
implementation today part we plan to

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:22,930
extend that so that secure boot is

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:30,430
supported and measured boot and a number

00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:36,820
of other extensions at TFA will be

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:41,820
certain involved in the creation of the

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:44,380
communication channel and about the

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:49,960
secure storage needed at this very

00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:52,660
moment your Kimmy's here I think so I

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,300
guess if you want to have more details

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,390
on the limitation aspects that we we

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,540
have identified you may want to to talk

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:04,870
with your kin it's just a little bit

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,780
more on that intent we were talking

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:09,460
about this issue earlier the intent is

00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,260
is that we want the same back end

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,970
regardless of whether tiyanak or

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,810
firmware it's used or you goo firmware

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:21,250
in both cases it's a UEFI API to talk to

00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:25,300
the payload for the OS and you know the

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:27,250
ideal is trusted firmware opti that

00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,620
stack on the backend produce your

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,150
variable storage

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:40,010
so that we're able to use the same

00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:42,780
infrastructure in both cases updates

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:46,530
plan is to make sure that we've got

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,180
capsule updates support the ABI and in

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,460
fact capsule update most likely we're

00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,240
talking about runtime services so pre

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,910
boot environment but capsule update is

00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,400
is the direction we're going and capsule

00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:02,850
updates is very important so I've been

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:07,400
warned that for example the FI T format

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:10,890
is not really that friendly with yes but

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,920
if we look at the market the market have

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:17,700
been in within the embedded system well

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:22,260
the embedded world is almost one project

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:25,530
one processor one software edge is

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,920
pushing the limits of that type of

00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:34,020
project in a way that you can't have you

00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:38,330
can do address for Madonna as you do

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:40,800
address for two million women and we

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,920
embedded is how to build address for

00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:48,470
Madonna always well here we need to

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:54,059
build thousands of different products so

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:57,150
UEFI API in his major element of the

00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:00,929
updates over the air or not and UEFI

00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:03,750
capsules have to be available to do

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:06,540
those updates and not just about the

00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:10,890
farmers but the certificates the secrets

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:14,250
at least whatever has to be updated the

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:18,090
OTA authoring tools should not care

00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:20,280
about what the SOC is to be able to

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,710
deliver the service which is the case

00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:27,350
today they have to have drivers per SOC

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:30,240
and which get mad people like

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:33,460
caterpillar or Volvo trucks because for

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:39,100
one system they may have ten different

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:42,580
Solutions and which is not it does not

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:52,470
scale for 150,000 troops it will not

00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:57,250
scale for two trillion devices I think

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:59,740
we took two meets over so thank you very

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:03,149
much for attending the the session and

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,149
for your nice questions

00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,499
