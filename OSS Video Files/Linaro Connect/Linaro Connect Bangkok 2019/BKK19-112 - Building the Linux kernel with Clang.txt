Title: BKK19-112 - Building the Linux kernel with Clang
Publication date: 2019-04-03

Description: 
	Abstract
Linaro has been building on KernelCI to handle continuous integration of the Linux kernel with multiple different compilers and compiler versions. This is used for catching regressions upstream in the Linux kernel and LLVM code bases. This helps ensure that Android and ChromeOS can reliably ship LTS branches of the kernel built with Clang. Come learn more about building Linux kernels with Clang, and how Linaro is helping enable this work via KernelCI.

Nick Desaulniers is a software engineer at Google working on compiling the Linux Kernel with Clang (and LLVM).

Nick has previously worked on TensorFlowâ€™s Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA) JIT compiler for Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and the Linux kernel for the Nexus and Pixel phones while at Google.

Nick also hacked on open source projects like Firefox, Firefox OS, Emscripten, and Rust at Mozilla.

Contributing to Open Source software and an accessible Internet for all are some of the things that Nick is most passionate about.
