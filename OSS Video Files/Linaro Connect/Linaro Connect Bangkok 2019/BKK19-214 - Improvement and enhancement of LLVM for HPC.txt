	Abstract
LLVM has reached a sufficient level as a compiler for system programming.
However, there are several problems as compilers for HPC applications.
Therefore, we are improving and enhancing LLVM for HPC.
In this presentation, we report our activities on register allocation,
vectorization, and software pipelining for AArch 64.
Also, we talk about some optimizations required to further
improve the performance of HPC applications.
