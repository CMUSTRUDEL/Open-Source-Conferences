Description: 
	Abstract
Clang and the LLVM tools promise to be a drop in replacement for gcc and
support cross compilation out of the box. In practice trying to make this work
can be a frustrating experience, with little documentation or guidance
available.

This presentation will distil some of the experience gained by TCWG, covering:
- Clangs model of cross compilation and how it differs from gcc.
- Why there isnt a clang cross-compilation toolchain that I can download.
- Building a toolchain based on as many LLVM tools and libraries as possible.
- How to use clang when cross compiling with cmake.
- How some existing open source projects use clang tools targeting Arm
and AArch64.
- Common problems encountered when using clang as a substitute for gcc.
