Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Linaro Connect Bangkok 2019
Description: 
	Abstract
From hardware to the application layer and everything in between, Fedora IoT on 96Boards will enable a new level of collaboration for a plethora of communities. In this session we will discuss current plans for Fedora enablement across the 96Boards ecosystem and how other can get involved in this initiative.

all right I guess welcome everyone good

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:20,430
morning so let's get started this talks

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:37,010
about fedora IOT on ninety-six boards

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:42,600
and we have with us Peter Robinson yes

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:44,789
so we support all fedora sports arm and

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,030
has done for a number of years I first

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:54,269
started working on the v5 Fedora

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:57,710
instance about nine years ago and then

00:00:54,269 --> 00:01:04,519
was actively involved in the

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:09,540
floating-point v7 bootstrap and later on

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:14,759
before or very very early in the arm 64

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,259
ecosystem we did the 64 bootstrap at a

00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,610
time where and we were running

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,420
everything on the emulator and it could

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:29,579
take anything up to three weeks to build

00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:32,579
QT or GCC or something like that and and

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,549
it wasn't unusual to get you know six or

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,210
seven days into a build to find it fails

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,659
for some really random bespoke reason

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,600
only to have to turn around and do it

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,920
all over again

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:55,710
fun times these days obviously a hell of

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:59,009
a lot has changed and the ecosystem has

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:03,539
grown widely and you can get extremely

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:07,859
cheap ten or fifteen dollar single board

00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:11,400
computers that we run on it seems to be

00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:15,300
that the speed at which the arm stuff is

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:20,130
growing is accelerating at

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:24,680
a rapid scale and it's fun and exciting

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:29,790
to see things that were I suppose closed

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:32,190
becoming quickly open such as some of

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:37,350
the reverse engineering process around

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:40,380
Maui and such and yet even nine years

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,820
later it still astounds me at how

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:50,040
quickly this ecosystem seems to evolve

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:55,410
and how quickly the hardware changes and

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:58,290
moves although some things not quite as

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,140
fast as I would like everything still

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,210
seems to be very focused around cortex

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:08,010
a53

00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:11,850
cortex a7 s and related sort of lower

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:15,120
end stuff so it's quite exciting to see

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,330
some of the higher-end newer calls come

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,450
up vailable around things like hiking

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,380
960 and various bits and pieces like

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:29,130
that also very excited around some of

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,500
the FPGA and offload and machine

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,410
learning stuff that's coming along

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,560
although again that seems to be a little

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,230
bit like some of the GPU stuff was a few

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,860
years ago very closed at very

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:48,720
proprietary so it'll be interesting to

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:52,070
see how some of that ecosystem grows it

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,440
will be nice to see a bunch of sort of

00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:58,200
some of the neural processor related

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,840
stuff seeing some open tool chains to

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:06,420
enable that to be sort of more widely

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:11,220
available I think so yeah we run on a

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:14,070
wide variety of hardware in the early on

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,919
v7 stuff every device pretty much needed

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,450
its own kernel fedora was the first

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,959
device to use what was known as the

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,490
multi-platform kernel and some of the

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:29,070
crew it will narrow that led that effort

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:32,070
were I suspect at the time widely seek

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,110
of dealing with me and my problems but

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,030
at the same time I suspect also quite

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:41,130
excited to see a destroyed op that so

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:48,720
quickly and now we produce a single

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:51,330
image in that one image of say a desktop

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,330
environment can run across anything up

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,440
to 100 boards across a dozen different

00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:00,120
soces

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:04,500
and we have an image installer which is

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,500
a very rudimentary bash script I smashed

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,710
together to make it easier and it just

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,830
seems to have grown but you know it's

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:17,670
kind of fun where you get emails or

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,970
pings on IRC say oh I just ran it

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:24,480
against his board it wasn't in the list

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,760
here's a patch and it just works and you

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,370
know different people in the ecosystem

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,110
oh I'm running it across these hundred

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,550
devices and it all just works and I was

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:39,380
like wow I haven't even heard of that

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:42,540
device and so you know I think fedora

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,850
shits in the range of a few hundred

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,300
device trees for devices and it's

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,540
amazing the time it just works big big

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,910
change to what only seems like yesterday

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,680
where we supported I think the Panda

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,530
board and one will tell you others so

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:14,480
the difference in the ecosystem is just

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:17,610
astounding for the next how many

00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,910
supported that's kind of the official

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,000
list yeah so that's the official range

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,780
of soces

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,960
and i mean it's always growing and we

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,380
don't I don't see well the high silicon

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,710
stuff is around the ninety six boards

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:40,200
I'm hope I believed ultra 96 so the

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,750
Xilinx one should boot the last time I

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,880
had time to test it it was very

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,480
entry in that it's supported MNC and a

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,170
few other bits and pieces part of the

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,760
issue I have is that the ninety six

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,870
boards crew gate here's another board

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,730
here's another board here's another

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:02,790
board and they pile up and yeah we only

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:06,390
have so many hours in the day so in that

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:09,000
regard it's I try to do it in such a way

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:11,160
these days where it's like it's useful

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,010
for the Fedora crew to have a board to

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,710
be able to test but if the vendors or

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,840
the people producing the board actually

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:21,960
want to drive the Fedora staff and do

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,960
the testing so that the Fedora crew can

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,000
focus on core stuff like kernel rebase

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,270
--is and stuff like that because you

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,340
know having two 300 devices across a

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:52,490
handful of people's desks just doesn't

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:54,780
scale yes o OS tree is a interesting

00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:01,140
technology it's basically get four file

00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:03,440
systems and from an IOT perspective like

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,740
it's interesting chatting to the team

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,870
that is in charge of the OS tree stuff

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,870
Red Hat had a product that was called

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,690
atomic which had a bunch of technology

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:19,169
and then there was a third-party company

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:22,979
called core core OS that produced a

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:26,700
distribution called container Linux and

00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,970
so we now have Fedora core OS which is

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:34,800
basically smashing those two together

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:37,830
and basically the fedora and what will

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,409
ultimately be Red Hat core OS is

00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,710
basically the taking the best of breeds

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:46,100
of those two projects merging them

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:49,680
together and coming up with a super

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,650
project speaking with the original or

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,350
the OS tree lead he always saw it as a

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,470
data center technology I've always seen

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,000
it as an IOT

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,300
that they're trying to use in the data

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,009
center it's basically get for operating

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:10,160
systems it's less flexible than a

00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:12,980
traditional distro because you get a set

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,250
of packages and then you layer extra

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,269
stuff on top the advantage of it is is

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:24,680
that you can rebase to a newer release

00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:27,649
you upgrade rollback so you can put a

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,370
set of constraints and last year we did

00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:35,170
a google Summer of Prodigal Summer of

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:38,449
Code project and out of that was a

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,970
project called green boot and so as the

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:45,259
system boots up it can test that the

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:47,000
image was applied if it doesn't get

00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:49,430
beyond say the grub and the kernel

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,430
doesn't boot you can trigger a watchdog

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,040
that will roll it back automatically and

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:59,180
so it's like a git rebase to a new one

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,220
if it doesn't work it rolls back so the

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,949
theory is that you should never get into

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:09,470
a situation that you have a nun bootable

00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:15,139
device so for devices on the edge that

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:17,660
may be inaccessible you know if you push

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:20,660
out an update to thousands of devices

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,420
and it doesn't work you shouldn't end up

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,240
with thousands of bricks

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:29,269
I was uncited a customer and they use

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:34,540
the term truck roll if we have to roll a

00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:38,149
truck to fix a problem it's expensive so

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:40,689
basically and so that's what the

00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:44,839
technology that Fedora IAT is based on

00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:46,910
and the intention then rather than so

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,879
much layering packages is to use

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,300
container technology so cryo and that

00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:56,000
sort of stuff to be able to run

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,680
applications in non root constrained

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,120
environments so that if you have a rogue

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,459
application it doesn't affect the

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,750
underlying device or the devices around

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:12,970
it and then

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:16,120
we're because we're a new variant of

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,750
fedora we also don't have a lot of the

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,639
legacy installed base so fedora 30 we

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,459
don't ship anything at all to do with

00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:29,589
system 5 and I finally managed to

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:32,319
expunge the remnants of that 15 or so

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:38,199
releases after Fedora switched over to

00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:41,339
system D by default and we use SELinux

00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:45,550
set comp various kernel bits and pieces

00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:51,370
to slowly bolt down more and more to

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:55,350
restrict basically the sort of and make

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:59,410
hopefully more secure the OS so it's

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,939
quite a small team at the moment got a

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,779
couple of interesting customers that are

00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:07,120
playing around with it and it seems to

00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:10,810
be just growing and growing and picking

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,620
up more and more speed which as lead of

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:23,559
that project in Red Hat is sort of quite

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:26,529
a stairs sort of related I was free in

00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,600
Fedora as well Fedora silver blue is a

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:32,670
similar sort of using the same

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,610
technology on the desktop and they use

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,980
flat packs for the same sort of

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:43,949
graphical technology so you end up with

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,949
in a musical desktop so yeah

00:12:58,380 --> 00:14:01,960
so yeah as Sahar sells like any of the

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,910
upgrades so if you apply a series of

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,830
library outright so securely whatever he

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,310
made to Wrigley and that's sort of what

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:13,060
part of the keep all the ability to

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,740
upgrade rollback if you deploy a new

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,540
version we can tiny you can restart the

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:26,680
container obviously without reselling

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:30,730
the entire OS I think what cover the

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:35,980
function it's a good thing I went for

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:41,220
the slots listing this morning six

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,220
boards we started

00:14:45,180 --> 00:15:00,579
yeah so the 96 sports and Fedora crew we

00:14:52,540 --> 00:15:02,470
first sat down in Budapest and we've

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,839
never really had much to do with 96

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,510
bullets the original high key and dragon

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,990
board for Tennant come out and they

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:12,639
didn't really work in fedora and I sat

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,940
down with rubble and yang at the time

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,970
and we had a relatively Frank Layden

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,550
discussion I remember and the

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,310
relationships grown ever since and I

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:31,209
speak to these guys probably on a daily

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:33,279
basis and you know it's fantastic being

00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:37,779
on the work with you know the team that

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:40,720
deal with it and the fedora IT support

00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:42,910
for 96 wards is fairly early on but the

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,690
whole floor IOT project is also fairly

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:50,730
early on and we support a small

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,750
selection of boards and you know

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:59,199
enhancements around that is growing all

00:15:52,750 --> 00:16:04,000
the time so some of the crinkles that we

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:10,540
want to achieve maybe this year or

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:13,510
something is huge of course free trade

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:17,699
so and improve support for existing

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,699
boards some of our boats

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:35,459
he's on the MRI and you PM support size

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:43,040
of things I think MRE

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:48,800
is mostly you PM this yeah I mean oh

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,800
yeah I don't remember exactly what about

00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:14,699
yeah something the big thing with flora

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:17,160
is we run an upstream Colonel and we do

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,740
occasionally or some enablement patches

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,100
in here and there but they're fairly

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:27,449
short-lived so if the upstream support

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:30,900
isn't fantastic for an SOC or a board or

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:34,169
a set of sensors the supporting fedora

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,140
is about the same the advantage we have

00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:41,820
is that the current Fedora stackable

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:44,090
releases are already on linux v the

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:49,679
development release is already got

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:53,610
Linus's 5.1 rc3 unit and so we moved in

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,919
a rebase very quickly this president

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,140
comes to that because occasionally we'll

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,669
get a regression and random maintainer

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,530
and the colonel get random emails from

00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:07,169
me going it's kind of help but you know

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,450
if the board isn't supported upstream

00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:15,090
that the device free for that board is

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:18,679
an upstream not loot in the IOT through

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:24,299
our IOT space we're starting to push

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:27,440
ebbr already so we use firmware provided

00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:29,060
device previously move the device and so

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,030
if the

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,100
or there isn't there in you boot or a

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,100
car or whatever the firmware board

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,110
supports it can be a little bit

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,230
interesting as well

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,390
part of that the illustrate stuff I

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,420
forgot to mention the vast majority of

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:52,520
the root filesystem is read-only to add

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:54,620
an extra layer of security and so while

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,410
we have the device freeze from the

00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,550
kernel there it becomes a little bit

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:03,110
interesting sort of gluing it in so you

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:05,600
can basically find it because of the way

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:09,260
that I was treated the underlying file

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:13,220
system hence the reason we went for the

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:21,710
firmware provided device free which is

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:23,660
part of the ebbr standard of support

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:29,210
fedora after launch now there's two

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:31,640
parts to it EB beyond and also ties it

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,380
to the nagisa's food software sometimes

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,400
that money give a talk on Monday about

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,330
which we also having ebbr obscene

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,870
support at launch

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,870
so with those two things given I mean

00:20:22,050 --> 00:21:14,770
yeah and if you like again yeah I mean

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,180
some of the world standards are quite

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,540
interesting

00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:24,780
I clearly forgot to put blue to

00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:29,710
International but worked closely and

00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:35,730
some of the 96 ports Edition stuff runs

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:35,730
on Zephyr I'd like to get more time to

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:42,340
the other that sort of use things like

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:48,010
Zephyr as an offload things like

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:50,860
Bluetooth mesh as sort of mezzo names

00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,040
and things like that

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,000
in Florence off we tend to go

00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,310
for more open standards so Zeke we

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,480
ZigBee is a little bit iffy because most

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:05,640
of the ZigBee stacks run on the actual

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,330
devices themselves and their interfaces

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,650
are a little bit interesting personally

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:17,180
I'm more focused on enterprise

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:20,730
industrial smart city solar stuff

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,810
because I mean I should have mentioned

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:26,160
this at the beginning

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:28,470
my job is high tea at Red Hat and most

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,040
of our customers tend to be more in that

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:35,490
sort of industrial enterprises solar

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,880
space we have a huge amount of interest

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,960
in the community around home automation

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,560
and there's a number of different

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,410
projects there that we're looking at

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,480
running containers on top of that and

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,540
they obviously because of home

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,950
automation support in particular the

00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:58,410
z-wave ZigBee voiceover standards they

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,050
go oops a lot of the support to various

00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,150
other things is purely about time and

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,100
interest if people are interested in

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:08,940
supporting they tend to come along and

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:28,650
scratch an itch and a sister and we sort

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:30,300
of scaled out like that and looking at

00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,700
the clock while we don't have enough

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,340
time to do the demo we said we have a

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,400
few minutes for questions and I have a

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:43,280
separate microphone so does anyone have

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,280
any questions yes

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,840
you talked about working you know on

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,720
industry smart city or applications like

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,820
that when we have an application to run

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,130
on the fedora IOT and we want to get it

00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,980
in the hands of odm so they can see what

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,220
kind of products they can build all the

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,750
way through the application stock

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,299
where's that outreach occurring is that

00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:21,779
just like the OEM to figure out it's

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:25,559
available or how do we so we now have as

00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:29,779
of a week ten days ago a landing site

00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:33,840
IOT dot Fedora project org and that

00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:36,809
links to releases getting started ducts

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,720
and bits and pieces like that in terms

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:43,770
of development and that style of

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:47,520
engagement we have a number of channels

00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:51,240
I'm PB Robinson at all the various

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,510
different so PB Robinson at Red Hat PB

00:24:51,240 --> 00:25:00,419
Robinson at gmail PPP Robinson at Fedora

00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:06,299
project org same on IRC I'm randomly on

00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:10,049
the discord channel 496 boards and they

00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:14,159
will it bounces when I or my email pings

00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:17,580
when I get reference there so from that

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,279
perspective we're still growing around

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,600
that level of engagement just simply

00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:26,870
because of the resources available to us

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,360
within RedHat it's a pretty small team

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:32,970
that are sort of loosely coupled across

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,090
a number of different parts of the Red

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:40,980
Hat organization and so we're certainly

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:42,929
getting to the point around that but

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,149
today we've been focused on getting core

00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,669
functionality available so people can

00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:49,289
actually test in that regard in in this

00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,240
next year in 2019 you think you'll be

00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:55,820
ready for commercial product to be

00:25:51,240 --> 00:26:00,030
deploying with fedora IOT yes

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:03,540
within RedHat I'm actually doing a and I

00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:07,020
can't quite mention the name yet but I'm

00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:09,900
working on two prototype customers and

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,130
they're looking to deploy in their space

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,860
in there

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,650
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,870
and one seems to think they can get into

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,760
the tens of millions of endpoints by the

00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:24,330
end of next year

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:27,420
so we're looking at certainly how we can

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,190
deal with that and scale up again it

00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:33,120
just comes down to time and resources

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,890
but the nice thing and my remit when I

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,960
started working on this and was given

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,570
the explicit role to work on this within

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,360
Red Hat is go and do it in fedora

00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:45,450
because it's all open it's all there

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,580
publicly we don't have to have NDA's or

00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:57,390
anything like that and so it becomes an

00:26:47,580 --> 00:27:03,510
open discussion I have to leave

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:10,620
physicians which session are you going

00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:12,900
to Sahaj the arm duck session and we'll

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,200
be around for the rest of the week so do

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,790
you come and speak to either us or

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,790
Robert and

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,959
