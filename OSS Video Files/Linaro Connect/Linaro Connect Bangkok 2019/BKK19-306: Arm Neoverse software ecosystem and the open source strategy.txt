Publication date: 2019-04-05
Playlist: Linaro Connect Bangkok 2019
Description: 
	Abstract
Arm recently announced the Arm Neoverse roadmap and two new platforms targeting cloud to edge infrastructure. In this presentation, Kevin Ryan (Senior Director, Software Ecosystem Development) takes us on the journey to enabling the full software stack for cloud-native deployment. Along the way, he will highlight recent ecosystem announcements as well as progress within the open source communities in addressing common challenges.

Kevin Ryan / Sr. Director SW Ecosystem ARM
An industry veteran with broad leadership background across all Go-To-Market functions, I started as a product manager, driving advanced product development and launches at Silicon
Graphics. From there, I advanced into leadership roles, including Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at multiple companies. A deep understanding of technology and the
markets our partners serve, combined with a belief that partnerships are essential to developing complete solutions, provides a unique perspective and passion for technology that translates into real world benefits for our customers.

My experience spans a broad spectrum of company size and market focus from my current role leading the software ecosystem team for the Infrastructure Line of Business at Arm to large
enterprise companies (NetApp) to early stage startups (co-founder of Terawave). Early in my career, I was fortunate to spend ten years in Silicon Graphics, a small company when I first started that became a large company. Throughout my career, a focus on customer outcome through technology innovation and eco-system development, has remained a priority I have maintained throughout my career.

good afternoon everybody thanks for

00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,690
having

00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,410
here today so I'm Kevin Ryan I'm

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,910
responsible for the software ecosystem

00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,310
inside what we call neo verse which is

00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,800
the infrastructure line of business so

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,770
we're focused on the infrastructure from

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,840
edge to cloud to enable the world of a

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,649
trillion devices right really going

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,329
after the fact that we believe there's a

00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:33,860
lot of fundamental changes going on in

00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:38,450
the industry and we're focused on that

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:41,900
infrastructure piece since the last

00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,490
Lennar o connect which was in vancouver

00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,160
there's been some major announcements

00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:49,700
and major things in the neo verse world

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,950
in the infrastructure world one we

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,090
announced we announced neo verse in

00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,340
October right after Lenore o connect

00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,829
shortly thereafter in November AWS

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,980
announced a tree and then graviton which

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:07,250
is their ec2 cloud instances based on

00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:12,380
arm and then we just recently announced

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:14,690
in February and one and E one which

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,060
previously you probably knew his Ares

00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,280
right that was the code name for it so

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:24,740
it's been a pretty active six months

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,570
since the last load ro connect you know

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,820
really one of the things that really I

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,920
think woke up the industry to arm is

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,909
being very much a legitimate player in

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,979
the hyper scale cloud space is the AWS

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,799
announcement you know Jeff Jeff was here

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:41,000
earlier talking about that I believe

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,780
yesterday a little bit but we're seeing

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,440
incredible traction and interest in ARM

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,270
based on the AWS announcement from a

00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,110
sufferer ecosystem standpoint the

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,340
interesting thing about that to me is

00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,950
more and more people want to talk to us

00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,900
now it makes my job a lot easier having

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,290
a platform like that out there in the

00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,290
market

00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,550
all rise my clicker gonna work there we

00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,710
go and that was an it though there's

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,690
been a lot of platform announcements as

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,800
well from our partners like ampere and

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:20,960
Marvel Larry was just here as well as

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,460
Fujitsu and Huawei another interesting

00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,050
announcement that happen around VM world

00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,860
that I'm not sure if you all are aware

00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:30,560
of but VMware announced ESXi and tech

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,410
preview so VM was very interested in

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,890
running their virtualization and a lot

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:39,470
of the rest of their portfolio on arm a

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,810
lot of the interest there comes from as

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,390
they push out to the edge with VMware

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,030
technology they're seeing arm everywhere

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:51,620
on the edge so I think that's an

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:55,730
incredible endorsement for the ARM arm

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,800
ecosystem as well let's talk a little

00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,810
bit about you know sort of you know how

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,390
we view the market from a knee over sper

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,220
spective you know it used to be if you

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,650
look at the orange line there on the

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,080
bottom you know the cloud was about

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,480
pushing video out to cell phones a

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,670
little bit of an exaggeration but not

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,160
much I think 70 percent of the traffic

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,260
is thing like Netflix and YouTube and

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,390
that sort of thing as we're seeing more

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,120
more and more devices and data being

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,950
deployed at the edge the traffic in the

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,560
internet is starting to reverse instead

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,450
of being from the cloud out data is

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,640
being generated at the edge at the

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,010
device and being brought back into the

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,780
network the trick there is you can't

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,940
just backhaul it all to some central

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,610
cloud you have to create a lot of

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,769
intelligence and compute capability at

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,590
the edge for various reasons one is just

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,150
economics you know get back hauling all

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,040
that data is really expensive but

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,830
there's also performance and application

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,959
ramifications as well so we think this

00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:58,190
is the huge opportunity for us in the

00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,370
neo verse line of business is as the

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,170
Internet is fundamentally changing

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,060
there's an opportunity for arm to lead

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,290
because a lot of these devices these

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,790
trillion devices by 2035 a lot of them

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,489
are arm based so there's a real

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,650
opportunity to take our edge ecosystem

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,480
and what's being deployed today and

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,250
leverage that into how we build

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,769
infrastructure at the edge and even at

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,760
core of the network so that's the

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:31,010
opportunity we see and the opportunity

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,390
we're going after we announced the neo

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,070
verse announcement basically we

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:39,740
announced a set of a processor roadmap

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,390
focused on features and performance for

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,030
the infrastructure and for the data

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:47,330
center and so we announced the you know

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:50,390
the core platforms the more interesting

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,220
saying I think from my perspective is

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,010
what we also announced is not just CPU

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,020
performance but we announced a complete

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,150
platform so we're not just focused on

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:03,740
the CPU we're building reference

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:10,100
architectures and designs complimentary

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:14,060
IP yo unique IP blocks EDA tools foundry

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:17,150
partnerships compiler optimizations

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:22,010
we're active in over 25 standards

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,229
organizations right now and you know

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,050
basically a development environment that

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:32,960
spans the cloud all the way out to the

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:35,270
edge IOT space as well as developing a

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,130
robust software ecosystem to support the

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,540
entire stack so we're not just talking

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:43,220
about core IP and processor IP we're

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,500
talking about the entire platform and

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:51,770
we're working on the entire platform to

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:53,540
enable that in the ecosystem so one of

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,630
the other things we're emphasizing is

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,240
workloads and really trying to focus on

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,800
what are the key workloads that people

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,950
are going to deploy in these cloud

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,229
native applications things like AWS

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,030
hyper scalar and those sorts of

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:11,570
applications that will be prevalent at

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,940
the edge so this is some data from our

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,280
n1 launch which was the Ari's you

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,100
probably know it as areas but the n1

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,200
launch so we're seeing a significant

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,570
performance increases in some of the key

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,790
workloads on the next generation

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,099
platform so this is something we're

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,220
working on and focused on very much now

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:32,990
is the workload level requirements at

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,700
the CPU and up

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:41,420
the software chain and making sure

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:45,500
optimize for those key workloads II one

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,210
same thing all right this is very much

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,850
focused on the 5g market and the

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,800
evolution of the 5g market but a lot

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,020
faster throughput throughput efficiency

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,480
and compute performance for you know

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,180
data plane and networking capabilities

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,950
we're working really closely with things

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,810
like Fido and DP DK on the data plane

00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:14,120
acceleration piece as part of this new

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:15,320
II 1 processor line as well so that's a

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,940
little background I'm going to talk

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,470
about software which is what I said I

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,260
was going to talk about more so that's

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,630
the platform that's the roadmap what

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,660
we're very much focused on as a group is

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,580
enabling the entire stack to enable

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,380
people to seamlessly run the

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,680
applications they run a run in the cloud

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,230
so you know we've got the networking

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,240
capability down below there's some data

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,670
playing stuff like Fido and DP DK an

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,970
area we're spending a lot of time on is

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,730
on a Cray no in the linux foundation

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,350
that is focused on edge use cases and

00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,690
there's a lot of carrier activity and

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,180
things going on there we'll work with

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,800
francois as well to connect that with

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,540
ledge and the work that's going on in

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,330
Lenora which i think is incredibly

00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,400
important as we sort of work through

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,500
what these edge architectures look like

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,930
in what these use cases are so I think

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,940
combination of Lennar oh and the work

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,750
we're doing in a crane Oh will be really

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,700
important to our success there you know

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,470
operating system side we've got the

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,470
major operating systems now up and

00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:21,140
running not a lot of issues on the

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,690
operating system level the area we're

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,610
working on really accelerating our work

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,010
on is around language and libraries

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,620
you know most all these applications

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,480
these cloud native applications use

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,580
these interpretive languages so we're

00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,280
working with the maintainer x' and the

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,630
foundations of the major languages to

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,540
work towards getting arm to be a

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:45,380
first-class architecture in how they do

00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,820
their release process and how they

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,560
you know developed a roadmap for

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,930
languages I think this is a really

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,740
important area for all of us is making

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,690
sure we get a robust engagement with the

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,250
languages in the major languages and

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,260
those communities to make sure arm is

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,740
really a first class citizen in those

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,930
environments the other thing I'll talk

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,830
about a bit is you know we're doing a

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:13,550
lot of work on the container side we

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,050
recently joined CN CF as a gold member

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,090
and we're working very closely with

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,520
kubernetes there's been some

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,960
announcements to date like rancher has a

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:28,360
edge k3 they basically built that multi

00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:31,190
architecture from day one using ec2

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,200
instances so they built both on x86 and

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,180
arm and released a multi architecture

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,510
support from day one but we're doing a

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,130
lot with the CNC F and the goal there is

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,680
we're working with that group to make

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:45,140
sure that we are part of their CI

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,760
process and that when things are

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,280
released when projects are released

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:54,850
they're released on arm and Intel at the

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:57,110
same time and then the workload piece

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,660
we're finding some really interesting

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,910
data as we get deeper into the workloads

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,140
and we're starting to see people start

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:10,040
to spin up instances like a one

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,500
instances one of the things we're

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,780
finding is if you take a look at an

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,790
application like nginx for example 60

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,810
percent of the external IP addresses

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:23,570
that hit AWS hit nginx first so it's a

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:26,300
huge workload in these cloud

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,740
environments and in AWS environments so

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,870
we've been working with nginx on

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:34,220
performance and what we found is that

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:39,170
even the a1 instances are as performant

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,750
as the intel instances in in AWS cloud

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:46,100
so we've got great performance story as

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:49,280
well as if you if you purchase ec2

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,930
instances we're about 45% cheaper so

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,880
it's a pretty compelling thing it

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,450
performs about the same and some of

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,970
these workloads and is about 40 45 %

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,650
cheaper so we're seeing a lot of uptake

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,360
this we're also seeing a lot of these

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,220
companies now want to partner with us

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,380
because they see that as a compelling

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,260
part of their story to their customers

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,000
right customers are always beating

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,880
people up on cost there's a way to take

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,400
a lot of cost out of your deployment by

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:21,440
running on on the a1 instances in the

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:25,490
cloud the other thing we've spent a lot

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,230
of time with is works on arm and I think

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,150
Jacob has been up earlier talking about

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,240
what they're doing with with works on

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:36,590
arm but we set out to really make sure

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,360
that we had a an environment where

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:41,240
people could come develop and get access

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,370
to arm hardware to basically do their

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,260
development work and play around with

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,990
arm hardware and get used to arm

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,580
hardware right now we've got over seven

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,280
and these numbers are changing every day

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,860
but we've got over 70 active projects

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,750
right now on works on arm that people

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,820
are running and you know doing

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,310
development and test work on works on

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,690
arm and there's a and I think this

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,760
numbers gone up pretty dramatically but

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,070
there's about 175 systems in that

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,230
environment so we're working very much

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,430
on the key applications and key parts of

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,620
the stack that we need to make sure

00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,290
we're a first-class architecture but

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,540
we're also making sure we have broad

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,700
access to the developer community

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,710
and that they have our access to arm

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,700
hardware through things like packet as

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,700
