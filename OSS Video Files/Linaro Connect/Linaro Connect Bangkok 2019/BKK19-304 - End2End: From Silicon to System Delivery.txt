so it's it's pretty excited to be here

00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,480
actually today relative to what I'll

00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:18,200
talk about fairly in a fairly short

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,869
section is give you a perspective from a

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,690
silicon server vendor what it really

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:26,240
means to go end-to-end from silicon out

00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,470
to solution to end user it's a lot of

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,260
times for Lennar o we'll talk about

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,419
individual components or standards but

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,480
we don't necessarily pop up a level in

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:38,720
and think about how all of that comes

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,190
together finally to the end user nice

00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,620
but I think especially today when we

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,540
talk about arm on arm you know Jacob

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,879
touched on the fact that there is a

00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,799
perspective of arm on arm as a developer

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,680
using an arm environment but there's

00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,559
also the end user running everything on

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,070
an arm platform and I'm gonna probably

00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:01,190
tend a little bit more to that so I work

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,710
at Marvel previously to that caveum if I

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,920
go far enough back Calzada is a startup

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:12,039
in the arm service and my focus is

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,930
really on partner an ecosystem enabling

00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:17,600
so one of the questions especially early

00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,329
on we'd really get is well why arm and

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,390
in some cases even what is arm I think

00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:25,460
that's really evolved over time and so

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,810
now with where we've gotten to in the

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,929
server market especially last three or

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,210
four years with level of diversity with

00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:35,420
AMD really coming back with accelerators

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,719
picking up momentum arm really being

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,479
seen as a not only a viable but really

00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,369
compelling alternative in the server

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,490
space for a number of reasons you know

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,649
some of which are listed here and I

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,200
think from Alan Aarau perspective we

00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:54,259
certainly understand and appreciate the

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,119
aspects of an open architecture and

00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,950
that's true both as we think about

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:02,020
silicon design and I'll touch on that

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:04,609
but then also the software perspective

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,429
industry standards and that's both how

00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:10,039
do we leverage existing standards like

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:13,069
you a5 form and what comes out of there

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,650
but then also as arm has complimented

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:18,930
that with things like SBS a and SBB are

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,359
the the ecosystem that continues to

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,629
evolve and and build on and I'll touch

00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:26,879
on what we mean by TCO both the total

00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:30,209
cost of ownership but also acquisition

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,000
and all of these are important as we are

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,400
out talking to members of our supply

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,909
chain as a silicon vendor but also our

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,849
end users but that that fundamental

00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:44,639
continual growth of arm across many

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:48,420
segments does help and play into what we

00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:51,359
do in the server space so just briefly

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,639
Marvell give you a background so caveum

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:56,540
was acquired and fully integrated into

00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,459
Marvell as of July of last year

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,200
Marvel is a silicon company focused on

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,669
infrastructure very focused on the

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,260
fundamental areas of data center and

00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:08,819
extended infrastructure and I'll I'll

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,669
touch a little bit on what those

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,129
products are just some of the metrics on

00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:17,760
the company side here certainly it is an

00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:20,489
engineering focused company the from the

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,060
5,000 employee based highly focused from

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:27,780
the engineering team side worldwide in

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,959
terms of multiple sites in the US as

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,109
well as Israel India China and

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,659
recognized as an innovator in the

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:38,579
industry so I talked about

00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,739
infrastructure this is really where you

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:43,949
see the blend of caveum and Marbella

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,449
from the caveum standpoint the focus

00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:48,569
there was very much on the compute side

00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:50,549
both server and networking certainly

00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,909
historically caveum really started in

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,340
the security space around the network or

00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:59,010
the security product line and then with

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,169
an acquisition of QLogic with both fibre

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,069
channel and ethernet and then kind of

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:06,930
classic we would call classic marvel of

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:11,010
storage and networking so as you think

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,290
about how we really focus on core areas

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,540
and how we can leverage our engineering

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,940
across those pieces it's a pretty

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,310
natural integration of how cavity must

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,190
come in to Marvel and where Marvel is is

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,440
really seen as leading silicon vendor

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,980
now across this space so that's it for

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,040
the company background

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:34,220
so I'm gonna use thunder x2 is the

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,980
foundation for my examples I want to

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,170
treat it more as kind of an instructive

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,640
rather than a marketing selling pitch

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,400
because what I really want you to

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,900
appreciate is when we think of all the

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,060
components that have to come together

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,760
and how they come together to deliver

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,610
that solution what it means different

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,460
stages in different ways we engage with

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,680
the community so our focus is a company

00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,960
of silicon that's that's really what we

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,780
monetize and that's what we deliver so

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,150
around the silicon piece we partner

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,510
closely with arm obviously we are an

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:11,680
architectural licensee so we will

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,940
license the ISA but then we will do

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,370
microarchitecture extensions and

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,530
optimizations for the areas that we're

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,210
going to focus on now a couple of

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,610
presentations this week I think in

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,590
particular you probably heard a little

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,020
bit from Andrew from Sandy yesterday

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,390
where you know software can either

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,900
adjust to the hardware or hardware can

00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,510
be designed with the software in mind

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,030
we've really tried to lean that latter

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,130
part and so what I mean by that is if as

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:45,020
you look at the architecture of thunder

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:47,540
x2 we're embracing our v8 8.1 from the

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,660
feature standpoint but we've taken it

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:53,860
further in terms of fully out of order

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:57,110
support up to four threads per core

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,690
memory subsystem is a fundamental area

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,510
that we focused on and that's critical

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,520
to a lot of the applications and the

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,470
customers that we've targeted and I'll

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,110
talk about how that comes together but

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:12,740
in our case eight memory channels per

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,320
SOC as really a unique extension around

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,190
the ARM architecture full cache

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,470
coherence so we support dual socket and

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,800
integration from some of the i/o

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:27,110
subsystems so all those components were

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,130
where we target how we design the

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,540
silicon and as we're doing that close

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,190
partnership with the open source

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,190
community in terms of enablement but

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,570
also end users in terms of what their

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,990
applications how they're structured how

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:44,100
they're going to take advantage

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:46,710
of this technology so even though our

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,710
focus is very much on the silicon we

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,140
have to have an enabling platform for

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:56,520
our early partners and that's true both

00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,770
software and hardware so we spend a lot

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,690
of focus around our reference platform

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:06,090
our CR B as we'll call it and to be able

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,360
to deliver this requires significant

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:12,330
collateral around our silicon as well as

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,860
layout of the physical board itself so

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,070
we'll help drive schematics and things

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,870
like that but we don't deliver that we

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:21,930
partner with an o DM in our case it's

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,790
gigabyte for thunder x2 many of those

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,830
systems have gone into Lennar o as well

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,200
as other partners so many of the folks

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,470
in this room have had direct access and

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:34,110
usage to that now that's very much a

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,880
standards-based platform so it's

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,610
actually server already certified we

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,770
work with arm on some of the aspects of

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,800
that standardization and of the testing

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,140
and I think it's a significant milestone

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,000
from the ecosystem his arm rolled that

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,250
out last year and that is just giving

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,490
more confidence to the o diems as well

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,520
as e OS vendors who take advantage of it

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,710
as part of that CR B we will focus on or

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,800
reference firmware implementation so as

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,410
we think about how we engage with data

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,350
center group on different aspects of

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,970
firmware design and development we've

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,860
got our own captive team to help drive

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,120
that within Marvel but then we also

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:18,750
partner with ami as a commercial

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,190
firmware and BMC partner to support our

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,320
broader ecosystem because we're not

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,020
going to be able to scale to necessarily

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,600
support the range of hardware and system

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,850
vendors we work with and ami has been in

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,210
this business for probably about 25

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:35,580
years so as we work with an OEM they're

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,760
used to working with ami so it eases

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:42,300
that engagement built on those standards

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,130
and as little change from that kind of

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,680
their model that that they're used to as

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,910
possible now in parallels we're doing

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,700
all this we're also working on the

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,420
kernel upstream right so a lot of times

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,940
things that we're driving directly or in

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,700
partnership with a MoU with arm or with

00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,550
Lennar oh we're pushing those enablement

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,440
bits up even before silicon has come

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,630
back in sample form so there's an

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,220
interesting timing challenge you know we

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,620
have the presentation from arm yesterday

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,810
on some of the future technologies

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:16,339
there's this interesting back and forth

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:18,769
between disclosing the technology before

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,449
you're ready to ship but you necessarily

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,250
need to do that to have the kernel

00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:25,100
enablement and then we've got to worry

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,750
about the timelines with the OS distros

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,240
these are things that frankly is an arm

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,829
community we've had to learn over the

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,410
years I think we've now gotten pretty

00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:35,209
good at it and we understand the distros

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,449
and vice-versa but all of this is

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:40,279
happening in parallel well before the

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:43,490
general market is even seeing the

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:46,730
product now from the CRB standpoint then

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:50,540
we'll also drive a lot of analysis

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,959
testing optimization both at the chip

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,850
level and the system level as well as

00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:58,399
from a software perspective so that's

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,850
going to help us as we go engage our end

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,860
users and and can accelerate our

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,320
shipments once we're ready for

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,079
production volume so all this is

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,860
happening really 9 to 12 months prior to

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:15,529
your production release and the things

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,420
we'll do at Linares getting CR B's in

00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:19,430
Toulon are oh well before production

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,019
release as well so sometimes there's

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,760
question of well why can't we just put

00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,350
this in the open well that's a that's a

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,360
challenge we have is a silicon vendor in

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,730
terms of we want to leverage the testing

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,339
and evaluation but at the same time it's

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,250
not quite ready for primetime all this

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,540
has to be done and able to supply

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,089
attention or our supply chain is is

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,640
ready and enabled now part of what we

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:42,440
also have to keep in mind is as an arm

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,740
server vendor we're going to be

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,019
installed into primarily an existing x86

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,730
world I'm not aware of anyone that's

00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,560
building their entire data center purely

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,709
from arm yet I'll be happy when that day

00:10:51,560 --> 00:11:00,610
comes so we have to really make it very

00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:02,090
easy for that conversion so tools

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,610
management

00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,890
all of those things have to look feel

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:11,150
and fundamentally operate very similar

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:13,190
or if not exactly to what x86 world is

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,350
used to so when we've got open source

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:19,630
management tools like slurm that you'll

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:22,070
see in an HPC world or other examples

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,490
debuggers profilers all those things are

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,740
critical to be as common as possible and

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,350
on the physical side as we work with an

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,390
OEM similarly we need to be able to fit

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:36,230
into existing chassis use existing power

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,880
supplies all those components as well so

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,220
these are the aspects that we we will

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,070
juggle we obviously want to show our

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,240
differentiation and value in certain

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:49,160
areas but it can't be just changing out

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,920
things just because it's nice because

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,160
it's it's gonna affect the cost and that

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,480
time to solution for the members of our

00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:02,300
different supply chain so what I want to

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,310
do is use some use cases with customers

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,310
to kind of amplify what I've just

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,540
described and these are all public so

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,310
we're at a good point of being able to

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,100
talk about them and they really span a

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:17,570
couple of different areas certainly HPC

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:20,060
and Big Data is one I think really

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,430
shining example that we've got some of

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,970
the arm native type applications as well

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:29,990
as a cloud or hyper scale so let me

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:33,200
start in the HPC space with Sandia this

00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:36,770
is really a major milestone for the

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,510
whole arm community and that in November

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,600
at the supercomputing conference in

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:45,410
Dallas Sandia announced with their Astra

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,940
system that it's one of the now top 500

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,930
official supercomputers in the world

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:53,180
first time for arm Sandia is part of the

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,700
Department of Energy National Laboratory

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,890
system within the United States

00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,880
basically Sandia manages a stockpile of

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:04,930
nuclear arsenal for the United States so

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,930
this is not only challenging workloads

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,160
demanding compute but very fundamental

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,610
in

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:18,980
highly current mission critical for the

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:22,399
entire US this is a system that the OM

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,320
here is HP it is the Apollo seven deep

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,870
lat form so that's an infrastructure

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,600
that HPE has had on x86 and now is

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,820
carried to arm so they've leveraged that

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,490
reference platform that I talked about

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,160
but they've got their own design within

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:40,730
that Apollo 70 platform so all the work

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,220
that we did early on enables HPE to

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,579
fairly easily convert and integrate

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,600
within that environment Red Hat is the

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,750
OS reloj

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,990
rel is fully supported as part of that

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:56,630
HPE deployment HP strategy in terms of

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,850
go to market is to really use a lot of

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,889
third-party software packages so that

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,000
includes open source compilers as well

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:07,120
as our Millenia tools rogue wave tools

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,120
they use open HPC for a lot of the

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,440
platform management and infrastructure

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,440
sandy is interesting and that they

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,199
really made a significant investment in

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,810
arm early on they've been running test

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:23,600
beds on arm platform back to mic hell's

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:27,709
a today's so this was very very early

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,899
and even very early signal 832 bit early

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,149
64-bit type of platforms and that's what

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:34,579
it's taken to get to this level where

00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:37,390
you really need an end user to make that

00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:40,760
kind of commitment and work with you on

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,800
development optimization and those kinds

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,260
of things so this is a I think are

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,690
really a something to spotlight that

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,490
everybody has had a level of

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,190
contribution to because of what it's

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:56,750
taken to pull all these components

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:58,519
together Los Alamos is another lab that

00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:03,790
is part of Department of Energy in the

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:07,730
United States this is been a large

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:11,209
highly scalable physics simulation set

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:15,500
of workloads now Cray is the OEM in this

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:18,199
case so with Sandia was HP with Los

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,990
Alamos it's cray cray has a different

00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,600
go-to market than HP Cray has a very

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,420
integrated

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,810
software stack so they pretty much own

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,029
the OS they have their own compiler

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,990
performance libraries tools so they're

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:36,910
much more self-sufficient in terms of

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:40,209
owning the software stack and this is

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:43,389
the first time Cray has taken a very

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:45,279
optimized compiler and performance

00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:48,519
libraries over to the ARM architecture

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,889
so now you've you because we've got

00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,600
really two different OEMs but we're able

00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:55,089
to support that with that common

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,560
enablement base that I talked about the

00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:58,750
other thing I'll mention and you've seen

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,850
some analysis over the last six nine

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,240
months in the market of different

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:07,089
compiler performance on Thunder x2 and

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,690
on ARM architecture in HPC comparing

00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:12,940
open source GCC with the R millennia

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:15,160
compilers as well as the Cray compilers

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,630
and the good news is they're all doing

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,029
pretty well and not no one compiler wins

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,920
across all codes depending depending

00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:25,540
upon the code you'll see advantages of

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,519
one compiler over the other the good

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,230
news for I think the industry as a whole

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,920
is you've got choice right you really

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:35,199
have three choices of of being able to

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,050
leverage that the RIKEN presentation

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,740
yesterday talked yesterday about

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:43,470
Fujitsu's compiler as as part of that so

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:46,259
more and more that choice and

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,089
optimization continues to come along a

00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:51,519
third example again in the HPC space but

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:56,019
now with a third OEM is a toss bolt and

00:16:51,519 --> 00:17:00,250
cea which is french atomic

00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:03,910
administration again heavy workload

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:07,449
heavy mission-critical focus across all

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,370
three of these HPC examples all these

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,900
codes are very memory bandwidth

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:15,880
intensive and so taking advantage of

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,890
pure performance advantage of what we

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,709
deliver not just as an alternative

00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,809
architecture and Andrew talked a little

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,980
bit in his presentation yesterday from a

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,049
Sandia perspective in terms of the

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,699
number of codes that they see benefiting

00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,100
right out of the chute beyond just some

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,679
of the micro benchmarks same thing we've

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,330
seen we've seen with CEA so this is the

00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,030
sequani

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,600
bull platform it's pretty innovative

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:43,300
architecture three nodes per blade a

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,320
very dense compact design and this is

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:50,290
also redhead based so moving from the

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,180
HPC kind of classic OEM model we also

00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,980
Microsoft so some of you've seen

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,520
liénarde vandorn here in the past

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,620
presenting on Microsoft's work at Asha

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,480
and this is for Azure infrastructure and

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,950
lienard's describe that you know a

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,140
significant portion of the

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,990
infrastructure at Azure can easily be

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:10,090
supported and optimized around arm

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,160
thunder x2 has been a key component of

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:15,280
that Microsoft's been talking about this

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,880
now going on two years since Open

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,810
Compute forum in 2017 where this

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,310
engagement was originally described now

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,010
this is a different model from the

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:30,580
hardware standpoint in that Microsoft's

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:32,440
been very open within OCP about the

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,450
platform design project Olympus so

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,450
there's collateral and design

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,310
information that comes out of Open

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,770
Compute because that's the fundamental

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:44,830
goal there is let's say open source for

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:48,250
hardware and Microsoft's model is more a

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,710
captive design supply chain rather than

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,290
a classic om model so again we're going

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,470
back and leveraging that common CRB

00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,630
across different customer engagements

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,400
and different enablement model and you

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,760
see different customers taking different

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,160
paths for their use cases and workloads

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,850
but that common enabling piece that's

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,230
that's critical for us another really

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,960
interesting partnership that we've had

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,030
and it really fits the lonardo space is

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,320
what we've done with the University of

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:22,690
Michigan one of the major research

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:27,180
institutions in the u.s. Michigan is has

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:30,670
a two rack cluster of thunder X nodes

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:32,740
focused in their data science and Big

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,480
Data environment so you see some of the

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,240
metrics here in terms of the the size of

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,710
the configuration Michigan is using this

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:44,110
both in their classroom teaching around

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,990
Big Data and data science but also for

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,530
their research community and this is

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,080
delivered some signal

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:52,330
a performance advantage for them running

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,730
on thunder X but from the lonardo

00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,170
perspective university of michigan's

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,880
been working directly with a big data

00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:01,510
team that's part of the data center

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:05,080
group here consuming the big data and

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,420
hadoop builds some of the additional

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,470
optimizations that have been done

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,020
additional features and functions that

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,200
have been added in and I think this is a

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:18,010
great working model for us going forward

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,440
in that we don't have a commercial ISV

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:24,670
or a commercial owner of big data

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:28,120
software in the arm market today so we

00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:31,090
have to have a very functional optimized

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,620
open source solution apache by

00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,740
themselves wouldn't necessarily do that

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,560
so Lonardo stepped in solved that gap

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:42,610
now can work directly with an end user

00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,950
like Michigan and really optimize both

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,080
the the development done here and how

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,420
Michigan consumes that they've helped on

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,920
some of the roadmap definition there's

00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,360
additional things like I'm barri that

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,550
we're what we're looking at and talking

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,250
about but I think that's a model that

00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:00,040
the more we can enable and help

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,620
facilitate the more efficient will be

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,250
within Lonardo for other types of

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,200
workloads last one we'll talk about

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,660
purely from the workload I think is most

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,210
exciting as we think kind of what I'll

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,860
call the classic arm on arm right so as

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,800
a server guy when I think arm and arm

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,200
it's the workloads that I can run on an

00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,960
arm infrastructure in an arm environment

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,170
so with cadence gains is one of the

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,750
major highest fees in EDA the electronic

00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,640
design automation space so as a silicon

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,130
vendor you use EDA tools for your

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,200
silicon design and testing and

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,990
validation it's a critical component of

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,690
how you build your silicon so with

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:44,970
cadence we publicly announced at Tech

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:48,760
Con in October full support for their

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:51,340
suite of tools on thunder x2 in the HPE

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,900
apollo 70 platform there's a white paper

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,670
out there's performance numbers there's

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,530
information about the application but

00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,380
what's key here is now we've got

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,300
commercialize fees who really are kind

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,980
of at the top of the software stack

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,610
leveraging all the work that's been done

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:09,670
over the last many years of firmware and

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:16,470
kernel and tools to have now commercial

00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:19,540
software where we can really build and

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:22,120
monetize all the initial investment

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,100
that's happened and we see performance

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,270
advantages because of the density of

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,700
cores and the bandwidth that we've

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,770
gotten Thunder x2 for cadence you'll see

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,660
that in the white paper but we've also

00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,120
got an interesting captive market with

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,310
many silicon vendors here as part of

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,790
Lennar o but in the market who are arm

00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,860
focused and who will be motivated to be

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,980
able to use arm infrastructure rather

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,830
than purely x86 so we're able to take

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,970
advantage of this within marvel part of

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,950
what we talked about at Tekken was

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,770
worked at arm's doing as well as HPE

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,700
using this internally also the other

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,380
thing I'll call your attention to here

00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,240
and there is the red box flex arrow

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,490
licensing so the reason that's there is

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,440
when your commercial is via commercial

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,360
software vendor in order to monetize

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,430
your software you need a licensing

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,690
wrapper and licensing tools around your

00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,910
software so flex arrow is one of the

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,890
leading vendors here we help sponsor

00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,890
some of the work to ensure that all

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,010
those tools are supported on arm that

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:20,160
was publicly announced last year and so

00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:22,330
this now eases the path for other

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:27,090
commercialize fees that want to take

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:29,170
advantage and develop and deliver on arm

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:33,490
so that gives you a sense of some of the

00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:36,790
use cases how we go from early silicon

00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,440
all the way out to delivery some of the

00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,870
benchmarks some of the metrics that

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,560
matter in terms of in order for us to

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:46,780
get the end users attention and and

00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,940
where we are going to spend a lot of

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,500
time on on our optimization both in

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,970
terms of how we design the silicon but

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,390
how we optimize the software and where

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:58,620
we push on things like libraries just a

00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,580
couple of you know figures of merit here

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,440
application throughput this is where

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,500
density of cores and density of threads

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,000
really pays off for us application

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,410
latency as it relates to memory

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,760
bandwidth going back to the memory

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,790
channels that I talked about and these

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,370
are you

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,080
these are decisions that each vendor is

00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,940
going to make as they do their design

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,280
but the great thing in the in this arm

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:24,140
ecosystem and our world is you've got

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:26,990
those options as well as PCIe number of

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,090
i/o lands with different accelerators

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,350
and different options that people are

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,030
looking for in the server space this

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,169
becomes more and more important as we go

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:38,720
from PCI gen3 to 4 to 5 and others and

00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:40,850
overall performance per dollar and I

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,620
will say for a lot of these numbers I'm

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,160
kind of giving you the the flyover but

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,330
there have been a lot of public

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,380
third-party numbers published over the

00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,030
last six months

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,990
places like serve the home as a

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:55,070
independent industry analyst some of our

00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,020
end users

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,480
Simon McIntosh Smith from University of

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,120
Bristol has been pretty active in in

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,110
publishing a number of papers as well

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,720
where some of these places are looking

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,490
at both absolute performance but

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,710
performance per dollar and what the

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,169
deltas are this just gives you some

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,179
example in terms of power and cost and a

00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,559
lot of these specific examples are more

00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,750
at the silicon level because we don't

00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,549
necessarily control the system side so

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,400
different system vendors are gonna focus

00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:23,960
on different targets for where they're

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,270
gonna optimize and in some cases they

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,190
may leverage a lot of that existing

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,870
infrastructure and not be able to take

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,220
advantage of all the some of the savings

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,440
here and I think you'll see that in

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:37,880
future generations where this continues

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,250
to improve back to how the silicon

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,750
thinks about the software there's

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,880
different optimizations that you're

00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:48,400
going to look at in a cloud workload and

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:52,790
a cloud analysis things like VM density

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,790
and and the core count where I'm looking

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:59,090
more at scale within a socket or across

00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:02,000
a system not necessarily always single

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,460
thread performance that are key in in

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,580
this market and then you contrast that a

00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:10,220
little bit on the HPC side where here

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,980
it's it's going to be absolute compute

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,150
performance and where I've got a lot of

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:19,429
the memory bandwidth it's going to help

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:20,610
me in that another interesting workload

00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:23,429
the

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,850
you are seeing a number of the armed

00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:29,820
server benders talk about is Android in

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:32,550
the cloud which is is I think a really

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,890
interesting example of again that armed

00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:38,340
unarmed concept so there's a case where

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:41,010
maybe I want to do CI in the cloud they

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:44,160
want gaming in the cloud where I'm

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,240
moving from an Android device to how do

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,700
I do that

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,340
host it on a server a lot of that today

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,890
is on an x86 and I pay a really big

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,550
performance penalty because of the

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:59,520
emulation and conversion from armed x86

00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,290
whereas natively I'm going to have a lot

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,460
of benefit you heard huawei at the

00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,070
keynote yesterday talk a little bit

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,460
about hatch and gaming I think that's a

00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,980
great example of where there is an

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,710
opportunity and in a server market for

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,010
us to really drive and take advantage of

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:20,309
this not in spite of us being based on

00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,510
arm but because we're based on arm and I

00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:23,070
think you know Jacob bleeding a little

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,690
bit that way and in some of the

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,910
discussion this morning at the packet

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,670
keynote where how do we really think

00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,950
about optimizing and leveraging the

00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,630
advantages of arm not purely just

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,530
playing as a catch-up and I think we're

00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:42,210
going to see more and more of that okay

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:45,020
so in closing a couple of things that

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:48,780
I'd like to challenge or have the

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,880
audience here as a whole think about and

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,420
and what's the role of Lennar oh and how

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,770
do we really work together to continue

00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,500
this momentum now that we've got a great

00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:01,220
foundation and I first and foremost is

00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,140
continue the leadership in the upstream

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:08,360
it is so critical when we're out talking

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:12,420
to our end users and can show the

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,900
capability the quality the where arm and

00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:19,920
1rl sit in this community is especially

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,080
around kernel compiler tools that's

00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,390
that's really key for a lot of our

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,840
customers so we we just absolutely have

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:30,210
to continue that I touched on the big

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,510
data University of Michigan engagement

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:38,400
that's a model I hope we can contain

00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:41,340
you to see come through in other

00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,830
examples where we can have a really

00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:47,250
fundamental important leading end user

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:51,000
customer and workload we're a place to

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:53,250
the advantages of arm as an

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,710
infrastructure play but also play to the

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:59,160
advantage of the Lonardo expertise and

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,110
engineering the more we can do this the

00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,490
more impact I think the more relevance

00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:07,350
than RL will continue to have what call

00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:11,610
this walk the talk we've talked a lot

00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:14,790
about how do we get arm systems in the

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,690
hands of you as developers but I don't

00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,100
want to stop there

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,620
I want the infrastructure to be

00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,210
completely armed I want to build systems

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,100
to be armed I want the test systems to

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,310
be armed I want everything to be ARM

00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,260
based and that's that's really certainly

00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,550
from a 1rl perspective I think critical

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:34,020
for how we look at the infrastructure

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:36,540
certainly that's what what we are

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,950
driving from a value standpoint and

00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,860
that's that's really what we want to be

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,470
able to to see and I think become what

00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,240
much more efficient as an organization

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,940
and finally how do we work with

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,050
end-users the HPC sig that's part of

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,150
data center group is pretty interesting

00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,590
right now because I think this is

00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,050
exactly what we've been able to

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:59,340
establish we've got members like RIKEN

00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:03,660
like Sandia where the expertise the

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:05,550
domain understanding of the workloads

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,980
and the space that we're trying to

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:10,020
address it gives us so much more

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,630
confidence because we've got the experts

00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,950
in the room and those experts can go

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,610
back to their infrastructure and

00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:19,800
validate and test and even take it to to

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,810
a further step so that more and more

00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,840
we're going to target specific segments

00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:27,570
and areas the more that we can pull some

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,570
of those partners customers in I think

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:34,950
is really critical so with that I thank

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:37,740
you for the time and I think I'll turn

00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:42,569
it over to LC again

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,569
