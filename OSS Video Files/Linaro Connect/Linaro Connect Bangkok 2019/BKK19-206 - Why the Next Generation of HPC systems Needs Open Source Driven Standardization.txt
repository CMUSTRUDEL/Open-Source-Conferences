Title: BKK19-206 - Why the Next Generation of HPC systems Needs Open Source Driven Standardization
Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Linaro Connect Bangkok 2019
Description: 
	Abstract
The HPC segment is in the process of transforming from grid architectures to private and hybrid cloud infrastructures while customers strive to run with maximum performance in their critical HPC environments. 
Driven by advanced computing technologies commonly found in big data analytics, AI/Machine learning and edge computing, the modern HPC infrastructure requires new design approaches that rely on having a choice of multiple hardware architectures, availability of accelerators/GPGPUs and presence of high performance interconnects to deliver highly scalable solutions.
Join us for a panel discussion on how standardization and open source software provide common foundation across all major computing architectures and minimize the impact of future hardware decisions on user workloads and applications. On the panel:
Yan Fisher (Moderator) - Global Evangelist, Red Hat
Mark Hambleton - VP open source software, Arm
Mitsuhisa Sato - Deputy Director, RIKEN Center for Computational Science
Jacob Smith - Co-founder and CMO, Packet
Rafael Tinoco - HPC Technical Lead, Linaro

	00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:13,920
we're going to have a quick discussion

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:16,170
on the changing trends in HPC we are not

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,600
going to focus particularly on HPC I

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,570
think we all here for the benefit of the

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,550
larger arm community in the ecosystem so

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,480
we will have the discussion on how the

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,700
compute

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,100
in general is changing where things are

00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,830
going with what the trends are and we

00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,910
have a very representative panel here

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,770
today

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,090
they're supposed to be slide somewhere

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,040
but I'm just gonna do a quick intro so

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,020
southest and we just heard from him

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,840
he's from RIKEN he is the deputy

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,910
director of the of the post a project

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:56,640
marker Bunton you know he's from arm and

00:00:50,910 --> 00:01:00,079
he is the VP of open source there then

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:06,060
we have what's your last name I'm sorry

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:10,520
yes yes so we have you here from the HPC

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,500
sig group at Lennar oh sorry about that

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:18,360
and also we have Jacob Smith who is the

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,200
CEO from packet one of the very

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,510
interesting cloud providers so we'll

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,210
talk a little bit about that so was that

00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,610
what we don't have going for us today is

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,409
we don't have a lot of time it's pretty

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,310
tight schedule for a panel was for

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,900
panelists but I didn't want to drop the

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,369
opportunity to hear from different

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,659
points of view on the topic and I think

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,000
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,970
hold questions to the end if there is

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,650
some opportunity to ask questions

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:53,400
towards the end we will use that well

00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,290
they resetting the the or the auditorium

00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,549
here for the keynote or whatever they

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:02,700
need to do right so with that in mind I

00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:06,780
think we we all heard that things have

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,439
been changing to do the better in a way

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,090
that we are now in the process of

00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,730
implementing

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:19,260
arch 64 in variety of segments we

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,150
understand that the trends have changed

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:26,349
in the past three to five years we also

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:29,019
have seen the impact that the demise of

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,420
the Moore's law have had on the industry

00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:35,260
and what I wanted to talk about here

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,239
today and probably start with mark being

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,590
from arm being also focused on the open

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:44,560
source and ask him a question about in

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,340
general the arch 64 architecture and how

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,620
does that there probably you were part

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,390
of you know many interesting moments

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,150
that have happened in the past we all

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,640
have you know I've been at it for about

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,349
six and a half years there here people

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,739
here in the audience I see some familiar

00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:07,360
faces they were here even before that

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:09,220
but can you speak to the couple of these

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,170
moments and where we are in that journey

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,720
today and what is the role of the open

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,150
source in that you're considering

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,709
whatever makes a fan suitable I fancy

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,430
walking around I don't like sitting when

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm talking to a group of people so yeah

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,639
so I guess the the journey into the into

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,920
the infrastructure interest into prize

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,480
space started probably about 10 years

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:38,109
ago and it's groups like Lennar that

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,880
have been a key part in porting the arm

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,700
architecture into a world that it wasn't

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,579
necessarily part of and I think in my

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,530
earlier career I was part of the mobile

00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:52,810
segment working it companies like Nokia

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,470
for a long period of time but actually

00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:00,160
getting the arm architecture out of the

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:03,220
mobile space and adopting standards that

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:08,739
weren't necessarily designed with arm in

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,500
mind like ACPI UEFI been a key thing

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:16,120
that we've done and it's been part of

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:19,389
the journey but actually now I would say

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,690
that parts done right the porting phase

00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,660
is complete and we're now at the point

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,940
where there are large scale deployments

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,850
there are systems that you can readily

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,560
buy off-the-shelf that have all of the

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,210
characteristics that you will expect

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:41,470
from modern data center technologies and

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:43,540
a variety of vendors building things in

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,780
all different shapes and sizes to match

00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,910
your performance or cost points so it

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,370
we're now at the point where we are

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,160
ready for primetime in the data center

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,990
and you're starting to see large-scale

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,390
deployments we've got a cloud provider

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,450
on the stage with us we've got a double

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:05,680
us here at connect as well and you'll

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:09,570
have seen there the AWS a one instance

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:13,630
we announced last year early this year

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:18,210
so we're really at that point where open

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:21,160
source has kind of enabled this this new

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,860
marketplace this new ecosystem for the

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,530
ARM architecture moving us you know

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:31,090
outside of the traditional mobile space

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,310
that we were in that sounds great so so

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,620
you just spoke to a couple of things

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,720
that kind of caught my attention we

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,990
passed the enablement phase I think we

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,310
all agree here I mean from Red Hat if I

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,410
didn't introduce myself I probably

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,230
should have some of you don't know me

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,750
but anyway I'm Jana Fisher from Red Hat

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,960
and I have had multiple roles related to

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,090
the ecosystem right now but what you

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,220
mentioned and what stuck with me just

00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,380
now is the fact that you think we kind

00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,560
of over the hump right so there is now

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,620
work proactively going on in the

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,480
community and actually at lonardo in

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,230
enabling the software ecosystem and kind

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,390
of ramping up the Developer and

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,990
Enterprise experience right so I think

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,970
Raphael can talk about that a little bit

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,360
since you're driving the work in the act

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:25,120
the actual HPCC can you maybe highlight

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,490
what is it that you're actually doing

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,490
and which parts of the stack you think

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,530
are being optimized today and as you go

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,200
through this there is an angle that I

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,360
think is ever present a present rather

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,889
we are doing this in the community we

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,080
are doing this

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,400
the upstream way right so what are the

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,860
impacts of the work that's being done

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,319
here in your opinion has on the overall

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:51,039
server standardization not just on this

00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:54,090
architecture yeah so first challenges

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,189
from HPCC group were related to

00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:00,189
architecture like how servers had its

00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:03,129
firm were working or not if P XE was

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:05,319
working so initial work was kind of

00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,539
enabling all the machines to be

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,930
provisioned and to make sure that the

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:14,759
soldier was running and at the same time

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:17,319
an initial work was started against

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,779
compiler optimizations so to make sure

00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:23,639
that GCC and LLVM supported the

00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:26,650
architecture if you take like important

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,279
HPC libraries like glass for example

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:34,259
glass had like some optimizations made

00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:37,479
for tender x2 CPU in the beginning so

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,759
but it was kind of hard for us to plan

00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,909
just because we were kind of enabling

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,690
everything so right now we have a fully

00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:50,770
functional lab we are looking forward to

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:55,719
have as we capable machines now to help

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:58,599
more upstream there is a so there are

00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:59,949
two types of works of work going on

00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:01,870
right now we have all of the

00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:05,409
optimization which we have a

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,389
presentation today made by our members

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:09,279
engineers like Fujitsu they're going to

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,919
present some of their work and credible

00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,710
work on LVM optimization and also a

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,650
future SV enablement for upstream which

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:22,500
is really important for just like showed

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:24,849
in previous presentation and this is

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,669
there are some challenges going on

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:30,490
upstream as you know so arm has obtained

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:33,490
some of the L of yam sve

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,469
code that there is a discussion going on

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,209
right now this is the part where the

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,339
Naro can help like bring you all the

00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:41,440
members to discuss I'll give an example

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,019
so for example there is an ongoing

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,880
discussion if fix to fix it length or

00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:51,430
variable length should matter for the SS

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,360
ve optimizations and the discussion for

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,639
HPC

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,709
it doesn't we don't care too much just

00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,499
because we're gonna compile or curl our

00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:01,059
code and if it's going to be optimized

00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:03,040
for our machines because all our

00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:04,869
machines are the same then it's okay for

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,619
us you know but if we're talking about

00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:10,929
sve like for I don't know smaller

00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:13,509
devices then having variable length

00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:15,759
optimisation might be good so this is a

00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:20,439
type of upstream discussion going on

00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:23,170
right now and so for to help the

00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:24,879
ecosystem what we're doing now is we are

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,579
making sure that our lab can have

00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,670
multiple labs inside so we have we're

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:34,869
virtualizing everything emu started

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:37,449
supporting sv emulated so which is like

00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:39,459
we could work but it's not as good as

00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:45,610
having the KVM and they put four sv

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:47,410
which just happened last week so we were

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,369
virtualizing our lab having infinite

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:53,739
band using sr iove and multiple KTM

00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:57,009
guests so we can run functional tests

00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:59,980
that's our next move on to get like all

00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:01,660
the HPC packets from open HPC and make

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,759
sure that all functional tests run

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,279
because it's virtual so we make sure

00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,290
that the functionality is there and

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,720
we're gonna help other vendors as well

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,790
because if we find regressions it's not

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,600
only arm regressions we can find like

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:19,089
our DMA regression for Lib our DMA or

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,689
Lib Mellanox regression for you know

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:25,179
Mellanox libraries and well and the

00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,709
future is that for this right after

00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:29,259
instead of just functional test

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,600
performance regressions test so is there

00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:34,089
a deviation in between like the previous

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,459
test and this one did someone break an

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:39,040
optimization that was done upstream and

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:41,889
this is our where we're heading at I

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,850
think that's kind of what we are seeking

00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:49,259
right now I think it's great and you

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:52,089
brought up open HPC so that's one of the

00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:54,160
examples of how the upstream or

00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:57,309
community collaboration can help not

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,419
just one architecture but expand the

00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:05,020
applicable results or improvements or

00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:06,920
optimizations to other platforms

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,860
collaboration you can actually get more

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,470
eyes on your code than your platform

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,540
so that's great one other thing that you

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,300
mentioned and I think that's that kind

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:21,580
of goes along with what satyr sang was

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:25,930
saying at RIKEN is the alignment between

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:28,970
the vendors and the community and also

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,480
the optimizations that are being put in

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,390
place right now there may be beneficial

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,940
for a certain you know set off or subset

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,880
of features but in general kind of

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,190
looking at a bigger picture what are the

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,960
what are the effects of that so so

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,630
that's not a question for you on that is

00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,900
so RIKEN is obviously at the heart of

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,580
the hyper scale rate race right and or

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,730
exascale I shouldn't say hyper scale X

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,930
STL we hope that you know you will break

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:05,120
the top 5 or whatever one the postale

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:07,910
launches so Raphael describe set of

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,420
optimizations you had some slides there

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:14,570
you also had what caught my attention he

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,980
also had one of UT kpi's or ease of use

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,870
and variety of workloads being supported

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:25,310
so that's apparently is very important

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,920
to you so the question is how do you see

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:31,070
the role of open source and this open

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,500
collaboration helping your project

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,470
specifically and you know enabling the

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,780
architecture of which post K would be a

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:43,040
one of the largest installation at the

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:49,610
time ok so first of all I'd like to say

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:53,870
why which is that so and that is of

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:57,470
course we're happy to choose that it arm

00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:00,560
architectures so but at the moment we

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:04,670
studied project so nobody is interested

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,690
in architectures for HPC so but others

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:11,160
as a certain beginning of my talk now in

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:17,160
many people is interested in

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:20,700
it's PC arm for HPC so but the reason at

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:27,030
the beginning of project is that we only

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:32,490
have alternative only just a choices to

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:35,130
choose the so so far you know the

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,790
current K computer instruction set is

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:42,630
the spark and the spark is almost almost

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:45,960
eight and we don't we cannot choose that

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:49,620
Intel we cannot choose the IBM so the

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,130
only solution we have is but missing

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,700
pieces for the unmarked issue is that

00:13:52,130 --> 00:14:01,770
decimally so I think SV is a very

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:05,580
important for the HPC so but looking at

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:10,110
the current situation only the processes

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:14,180
which is going to support SPE is the our

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:18,240
processor but in a meantime kaboom and

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,610
another process of water on process of

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:30,120
what I promise is going to help that s

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:33,690
be so still we think this ve is a very

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,890
important and especially is the

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:41,190
comparative analysis for vectorizing is

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:52,160
something for to make use of this V my

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:57,690
more efficiently so to increase to make

00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:03,860
like maker more effective

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:07,910
the open-source community is what HPC is

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:12,000
the one of the key is how to support SB

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:18,720
so currently we are using the arm

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,320
compiler support it and and this

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:29,780
compiler so it's a many difference so

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:37,560
and I'll say that for the photo they

00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:44,910
still the era Librium for sve it's not

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:57,630
open yet so so i'd like to ask how to

00:15:44,910 --> 00:16:02,010
open the or area for the SBE from from

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:08,550
the compare team so I think this is the

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:12,410
very important issues to make the

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:16,490
open-source communities more excited

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:21,480
effectively by so that is my comment

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:24,480
okay so I guess what what what you were

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,330
saying is that sv was developed as a aid

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,580
to a supercomputing to argument the

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,040
architecture but because of the wide

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,860
industry wide collaboration or ecosystem

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,110
wide collaboration SV is becoming a

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,720
thing of its own and it will enable

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,150
other implementations in the future and

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,470
because of the model that arm has and

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,980
because of the number of vendors

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,839
participating in the ecosystem this

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,000
instruction set would actually benefit a

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,030
variety of companies a variety of use

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,160
cases and and that's that's hopefully

00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,320
will be true I mean that's a fair

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,220
request to arm to to look into doing

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:05,430
that in the meantime I think you've

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:08,410
building a very homogeneous computer

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:12,280
it's a and the large one at that

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:15,370
what I wanted to connect here or the way

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,530
I'm trying to kind of align this in my

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,329
in my head there will be those

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,150
implementations out there there will be

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,490
big machines they almost purpose-built

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,610
you know for science for large problems

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,380
and there will be smaller installations

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:32,400
more smaller implementations that can

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:36,400
take advantage of the features as sve so

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,980
Jacob I guess for you I have an

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,750
interesting question here packet does

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:45,250
have a pretty non-standard model on you

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,430
know and how you engage the developer

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,430
community how you engage enterprises

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,140
looking to start the development on the

00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,840
new platform you support you by

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,850
definition you heterogeneous you have

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,600
that it urgency I believe in every

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:05,020
single Center that you guys deploy

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,990
worldwide so having said that or was

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,490
that in mind what are you doing

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,320
differently and what are the what was

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,740
the mindset what's happening under the

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,780
hood when you were enabling this type of

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,000
environment and was there a preference

00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,230
to one architecture or the other how was

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,820
the you know how was the initial

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:29,590
deployments deployment was set up and

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:31,870
what was happening was that great well

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,910
first of all it's been really fantastic

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,670
to be involved in the HPC community

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,260
really because of yon bringing me in on

00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,170
the panel here and in a previous

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,370
conference and I have to say it's really

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,650
mirrors what we see with some of the

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,920
biggest enterprises and also hyper

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,570
scalars look a lot like HPC and that

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,330
they they sort of design the hardware

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,340
around the software instead of the

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,110
software around the hardware which is a

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,660
really interesting concept that I guess

00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,950
is tied to scale when we got started

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,780
like Yann mentioned we're a multi

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,790
architecture shop we provide access to

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:07,300
bare metal but a lot of our customers

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:09,340
are looking for scale and so I guess you

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,430
on the answer to your question is that

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,800
we thought really about user driven

00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,080
needs what what does a user need and

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,220
sometimes it's an architecture that's

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,480
comfortable to us but oftentimes it's

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,460
you know something that can help

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,530
distinguish them so certainly on our

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,170
site as a cloud provider we're really a

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,050
channel for the technology that's coming

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,670
out of you know Silicon makers and other

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,280
people in the industry who are creating

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,260
actual IP and we're helping to deliver

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,840
it hopefully with the opinion of the

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,540
end-user in this case a supercomputer

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,970
but we're seeing enterprises look more

00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,950
and more like building supercomputers

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,230
when they get to scale of workload

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,600
whether it's AI or you know you know

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,640
running 20 billion API calls a day and

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,520
so they have that sort of intent which

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,140
is really fascinating a couple lessons

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,770
we've learned is that you have to think

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:02,870
about you know variety from the

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,550
beginning it's very hard to come back

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,520
and undo it and make something that's

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,600
naturally inflexible flexible you got to

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,790
think a little bit I love that you're

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,120
you highlighted ease of use and open

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:19,400
source in your design I think designing

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:21,920
for a certain amount of a future that

00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,530
you don't know yet is essentially being

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,210
open to that possibility and that's kind

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,620
of the world of open source too in the

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,980
world of software it's moving so much

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,750
faster than we can sort of predict that

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,290
having a sort of well tell me what you

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,470
need

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,480
approach is is well certainly our

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,910
strategy but I think it's also where

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,440
we're seeing a lot of the largest

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,620
companies go and they're looking to

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,000
solve the problem versus simply using

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,120
the tools that are available that's

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,660
what's really attractive about the arm

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,690
ecosystem is it's a ecosystem of

00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:59,930
solutions versus you know a menu of of

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:04,430
predetermined SKUs which is exciting

00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:06,020
right yeah great yeah I think the HPC

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,390
has been historically on the forefront

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,880
of they've been the on the bleeding edge

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:13,340
the early adopters the first you know

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,500
food in the door type of deployments and

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,900
installations certainly what we've heard

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,600
today and hopefully you guys agree in

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,210
the audience is that it's continuous as

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:28,580
we shift the paradigm of computing in

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:31,850
general to customise but open model type

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,539
of implementations right so you will see

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,130
people build

00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:37,760
you know large sites or smaller

00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,950
companies which have now the opportunity

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,720
innovating at that level where they can

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,789
build a relatively custom

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,970
implementations and they can use and

00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:51,179
choose different cores now not just from

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,470
arm there is also a variety of other key

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,390
textures that are there that are

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,039
available I think arm has an advantage

00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,230
of being there for a while and also

00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,960
having this model of working with

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:04,080
multiple vendors but to summarize I

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,250
think what we are experiencing right now

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,740
is a shift in mentality of how the

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,510
compute will be delivered and when I say

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,220
compute I really mean the combination I

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,220
mean we saw that in Saturn's

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,220
presentation memory and networking is

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,409
being brought on on SOC s all the

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,679
components are really being integrated

00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:28,020
and sometimes purpose-built while they

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,250
all standardized which allows folks like

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:35,549
Red Hat zhuzhing and canonical bring a

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:38,309
unified layer of the operating system to

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,530
communicate with all of the innovation

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:43,679
that's happening at the silicon level so

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:47,070
we still in mind with 35 seconds over I

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,840
can keep on going and talk about that

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,549
but I want to see if we can maybe

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,350
squeeze in a question or two from the

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:55,169
audience before we gonna get kicked out

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,289
of this room all right here's a question

00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:59,880
yes sir

00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:04,260
in cuddle sounds presentation there is a

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,870
key word about AI and so far media has

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,990
been dominated a I in the cloud you know

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:14,700
with post Kade SV either's certainly

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:18,860
potential to use arm as AI accelerator I

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:22,730
just post a question to the panel like

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:26,190
will enable AI on the supercomputer

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:30,059
strategy for this arm community and and

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:31,460
if it is like what will be how can we

00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:34,730
get there

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:37,140
great question who wants to answer that

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,929
all right mark

00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,940
I think there's a presentation from Matt

00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:44,549
and Nigel Stevens later which will

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:51,270
explain how that goes Matt what session

00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:53,070
is it twelve that yes one of the things

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,690
that's I'm not going to pre-announce

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,630
what they're talking about later but

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:01,500
there's some technology based on the

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:03,720
work that was described earlier there's

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,460
being announced for the mainstream which

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,370
would mean that that capability is

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,679
available everywhere and in general AI

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,080
enablement has become a norm I mean the

00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,690
top two supercomputers out there right

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,070
now they fully load it was GPUs they

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,630
predominantly run a I focused workloads

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:25,380
at least from what the press has and

00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:28,740
what what we know I think that is where

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,450
we all going enhancement and reduction

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,570
of the floating-point the size of the

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,330
floating points and you inherent

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:40,140
speed-up in getting to to the answer

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:43,200
that is where inference networks will

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:45,360
will do great and I think maybe that's

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,640
what the whole a representation is going

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,730
to talk about South Estonia so I'd like

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,130
to add it to a point so one of the

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:58,350
things is that instruction set so I

00:24:53,130 --> 00:25:02,309
think the issue countries we is theirs

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:04,679
can support the tape running but I think

00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:07,980
it will be answering enhanced in an

00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:14,610
ex-patient way so and another things is

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:19,100
that therefore I think that's from

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:21,470
standpoint of the supercomputers so me

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,929
application is just for the training

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:27,630
during the of the deep running so for

00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:31,280
the training in for the right scale at a

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:34,860
network we need memory bandwidth and

00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:39,030
high-speed interconnection so rather

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:42,330
than just the performance of single

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,310
processes we you need network bandwidth

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:48,050
and

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:52,520
and all Network roar agency and also and

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:55,600
the memory buddies great any more

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,360
questions from the audience to the panel

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,870
I'm just resting to attend to be kicked

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:10,910
out of the room but any any thoughts on

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:14,060
what we heard today any reflections okay

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:16,010
well with that I want to thank our panel

00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:20,120
thank you for being here this morning

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:23,020
and thanks for a very insightful I would

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:28,420
look on the future of HPC

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,420
