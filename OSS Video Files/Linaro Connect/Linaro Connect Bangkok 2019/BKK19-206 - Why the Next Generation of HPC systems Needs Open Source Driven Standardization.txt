Description: 
	Abstract
The HPC segment is in the process of transforming from grid architectures to private and hybrid cloud infrastructures while customers strive to run with maximum performance in their critical HPC environments. 
Driven by advanced computing technologies commonly found in big data analytics, AI/Machine learning and edge computing, the modern HPC infrastructure requires new design approaches that rely on having a choice of multiple hardware architectures, availability of accelerators/GPGPUs and presence of high performance interconnects to deliver highly scalable solutions.
Join us for a panel discussion on how standardization and open source software provide common foundation across all major computing architectures and minimize the impact of future hardware decisions on user workloads and applications. On the panel:
Yan Fisher (Moderator) - Global Evangelist, Red Hat
Mark Hambleton - VP open source software, Arm
Mitsuhisa Sato - Deputy Director, RIKEN Center for Computational Science
Jacob Smith - Co-founder and CMO, Packet
Rafael Tinoco - HPC Technical Lead, Linaro
