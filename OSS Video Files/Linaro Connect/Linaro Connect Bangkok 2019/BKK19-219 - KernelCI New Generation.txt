Publication date: 2019-04-11

Description: 
	Abstract
KernelCI generates daily an average of two thousand Linux Kernel builds, submitted to several labs across planet to mainly check if system booting works correctly. Therefore tons of data are created and displayed on a frontend interface for further use. Current KernelCI requires significant technical effort changing visualizations, including builds and jobs listings. The KernelCI New Generation seeks to apply state-of-the-art data collection and data visualization tools as an alternative frontend to KernelCI. Our focus is on an instance of ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana collecting and displaying live KernelCI data. All the tooling used to this project will be available.
