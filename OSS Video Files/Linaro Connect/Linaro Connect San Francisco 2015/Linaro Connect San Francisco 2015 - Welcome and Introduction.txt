I'm George Gray linaro CEO and we're

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,770
here at San Francisco 2015 villain ro

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,230

00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,110
happy to be in sunny California the

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,460
theme for this year's Connect is

00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,230
security because everywhere we look

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,080
every time we talk to anyone or we look

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,210
at the technology behind things security

00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,739
is a really big issue in personal

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,110
devices in the data center and

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:47,360
everything in between so for this this

00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,339
year's connect we have a number of

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,640
sessions every day there's at least one

00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:55,610
station on security and we have a panel

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,210
at the end of the week and a pad normal

00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,700
focused around home on security and a

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,920
bunch of invited security experts coming

00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,270
along so you're interested in security

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,360
there's something happening every day

00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,950
okay George so another connect five

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,530
years it's been what are you looking

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,570
forward to it this connect so as always

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,759
we have an amazing time here at connect

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,520
it's the place where the arm ecosystem

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,950
comes to collaborate and work together

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,899
this year we've got more companies than

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,250
ever before coming those are going to be

00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,780
a really good range of technical

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,380
discussions i'm looking forward to

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,090
everything from IOT and embedded through

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,440
mobile digital home networking

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,479
enterprise and a really good week's

00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,490
agenda ahead of us looking forward to it

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,509

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,399
you've been here with from the beginning

00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:49,310
house connect changed between the first

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,080
one and now so I mean obviously it's

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,319
bigger and much more complicated the

00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:57,020
very first one we shared with UDS and

00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:01,160

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,080
very informal now we've got 560 I can't

00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,390
even remember we've got 50 60 ring

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,940
committees all having meetings

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,819
discussing their areas we've got a lot

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,500
of more technical sessions plus we've

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,430
got the hacking rooms we've got kind of

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,190
500 people this is 40 and five meetings

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,240
so it's just much more complicated but

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,460
it's still it's still fun

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,010
as well as being highly technical so

00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,810
very very busy week looking forward to

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,240

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,980
discussions so how big is connect this

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,660
year I always seem to be saying this but

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,970
this year is going to be the biggest yet

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,360
here in San Francisco we're expecting

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,460
over 600 people and I think it's going

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,320
to be an amazing event everything this

00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,950
year and indeed last year has been about

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,980
IOT what's linaro story around IOT

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,290
linaro driven by our membership is

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,970
looking at forming and IOT and embedded

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,400
group so we've been talking with a bunch

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,890
of companies working out what the

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,630
technical and engineering agenda is and

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,270
obviously at this connect we'll be

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,880
talking to all companies and moving that

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,160
forwards okay nice six boards was

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,500
discussed last year this time last year

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,420
at the members meeting in Paris it's

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,940
been a year lots of stuffs happened what

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,190
what are your favorite moments I think

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,000
it's been amazing we went from an idea a

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,470
year ago to products in the market today

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,180
there's going to be some incredible

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,900
demonstrations of what you can do with a

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,930
64-bit $75 board and the fact that a

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,140
single standard platform is being

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,880
adopted by multiple SOC vandals I'm sure

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,850
this is really going to help the entire

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,380
arm ecosystem and just wait and see what

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,670
we've got in store for this week that

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,670
connects and for the coming months

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,020
