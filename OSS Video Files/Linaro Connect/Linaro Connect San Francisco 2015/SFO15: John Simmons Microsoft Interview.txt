we're here today with John Simmons of

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,420
Microsoft the media platform architect

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,150
who's been responsible for a lot of work

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,609
in standardization of DRM

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,189
interoperability and common file

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,410
streaming formats John what is the

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,210
importance of open-source software with

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,699
respect to digital rights management and

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,010
enhanced content protection you know

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,160
it's really an amazing thing because in

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,430
the in the last I'd say four to five

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,770
years the advances in terms of making it

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:43,260
possible for interoperable open source

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,430
browsers to consume commercial video

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,750
content has exploded because of the

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,910
requirements of enhanced content

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,649
protection pushing the drm down into the

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,059
platform and enabling the kind of

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,730
interfaces that we've been discussing

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,160
today the open CDM which is on github

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,930
which is based on a specification that

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:07,560
Microsoft published several years ago so

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,729
and in fact it's critically important

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,470
that not only HTML Javascript standards

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,689
based applications can consume

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,939
commercial video but that the browsers

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,710
themselves are portable across platforms

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,990
both of those are critical to the

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,909
overall growth of the of the Internet

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,340
delivered

00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:27,740
what were the key standards responsible

00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,840
for the progression to interoperable drm

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,609
yeah so so the the most important

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,909
standards the first standard was the

00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:37,369
common encryption spec which Microsoft

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:41,869
made the first version of that spec and

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:44,270
published it at IBC in 2009 and that was

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:46,520
the starting point where we got all of

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,349
the drm providers to agree to support

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,359
that spec even before it was a standard

00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,670
and once it became a standard and got

00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:55,549
coupled with the dash spec the dynamic

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,310
adaptive streaming over HTTP spec we

00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,379
were on our way to developing a

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,469
interoperable media encoding framework

00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:05,270
for commercial video you mentioned that

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:08,140
we are at an important inflection point

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:12,470
in the industry where we can now have

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:15,079
many devices and many services being

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,470
broadcast with enhanced content

00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:20,720
protection well I think the important

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,709
thing is as I mentioned earlier is that

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,069
we had a big inflection point in 1989

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:30,859
with the internet when AT&T made tcp/ip

00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,870
public source and open source and at the

00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:36,170
same time we had a major inflection

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,109
point in 1993 with the web when the web

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,299
went from 26 websites to a million

00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:44,530
websites by 97 because of the existence

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:47,000
of mosaic every time there is a

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,099
decoupling of the server you know the

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,579
source of content on the internet and

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:54,560
the receiver of the content a decoupling

00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,810
through standards and open source

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
implementations we see a hockey stick

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,019
growth and we're about to see a hockey

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,269
stick growth in commercial video

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:06,380
delivery and more importantly in such a

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:08,599
way where we've freed up the long tail

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,019
of commercial video because it no longer

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,540
will take them as many development hours

00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:16,720
to produce clients on all the different

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,519
embedded devices the 15 billion

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,980
video-enabled embedded devices that

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,549
we're going to see worldwide by 2020 if

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,579
they're all supporting html5 JavaScript

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:31,130
implementations and drm well into the

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:34,220
hardware then all those video services

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,079
will be lit up all the ones that have to

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,710
do with sports franchises i like to

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,210
think every

00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,850
magazine you see in a magazine stand

00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,340
could become a television channel by the

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,800
year twenty twenty what is the impact

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,380
you see to enhanced content requirements

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,270
for new 4k video and HDR standards and

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,920
also the respect with respect to the

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,080
fact that they require trusted execution

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,300
environments and how do you think that

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,310
will impact the porting kits that are

00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,160
available for digital rights management

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,490
solutions that's a really good question

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,340
and what we've seen as I mentioned in

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,190
the talk this afternoon is so as above

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,650
and below we're seeing many implement

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,140
many instances including with Internet

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,000
of Things where key developments in

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,360
embedded devices or work are going to

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,170
make certain kinds of cloud services

00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,260
practical from a business perspective

00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:27,020
and this is also true for commercial

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,230
video delivery the enhanced content

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,810
protection requirements coming from

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:36,020
principally from the movie labs paper

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,840
but also across the industry is driving

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,000
drm closer to the hardware closer to the

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,120
metal and in the process of doing that

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,100
it's freeing up the applications from

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,110
being involved in the trusted execution

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,980
environment for kind of lifting them up

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,930
where they can be more interoperable so

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,730
that tendency is kind of a perfect storm

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,100
the tendency towards enhanced content

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:03,730
protection coupled with the emergence of

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:07,100
new standards for html5 for consuming

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:12,730
drm protected video content coupled with

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:15,740
the the ability for those browsers to be

00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,810
into to be decoupled from which

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,940
particular drm technology they're

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,030
talking to through an interface like the

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,370
open CDM this tendency is what's

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,729
actually enabling large-scale growth of

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,789
commercial video

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,789
