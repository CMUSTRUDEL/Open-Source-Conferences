hi everybody i'm david mandela with

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,480
linaro i'm the director working closely

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,519
with the 96 boards and trying to bring

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,190
out the 96 board program and i'm here

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,170
with glenn from arrow who's got a 96

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,730
board had been manufacturing one and

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,869
they've got more in the hopper so we're

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,510
going to talk a little bit about that

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,260
while we're here at linaro connect it's

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,820
kind of exciting all right so Glen

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,529
you're here at Lenara connect and you

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,940
you guys have produced a board for I

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,739
believe Qualcomm and you've got other

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,540
boards in the hoppers what got you all

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,059
excited why are you participating in a

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,460
96 board program thanks David appreciate

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,710
it you know arrow is really proud to

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,469
sponsor linaro connect san francisco

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,450
2015 because we believe in the value

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,149
that linaro is bringing to our customers

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,850
from a software standpoint in addition

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,559
we've decided to be a part of 96 boards

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,899
by introducing hardware into the

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,140
ecosystem to give those same customers

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,399
you know a chance to use the technology

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,140
going I'm really glad you guys sponsored

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,540
us that first off thank you very much

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,909
because it's it's really cool we all got

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,500
over 500 people here and every bit helps

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,299
to make this thing a better thing

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,340
getting community together absolutely

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,049
also thanks for the 96 boards I

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,390
understand you know you've got boards

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,799
and hopper you Qualcomm set this board

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,500
through you the Qualcomm Snapdragon

00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,850
dragon board for 10 see what can you

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,470
tell me can you tell me anything about

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,210
the boards in the hopper or is that

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,700
still undercover wii other than

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,229
acknowledging you're doing it yeah so

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,630
you know arrows arrows very excited to

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,250
be part of the 96 boards program our

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,009
first board they were introduced was the

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,630
Qualcomm dragon board for 10 see we've

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,430
collaborated with Qualcomm a great deal

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,950
and Lennar a great deal to get that

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,799
board introduced into the ecosystem we

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,920
also have a second board based on

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,079
freescale I mx7 that will launch when

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,329
the silicon launches which sounds like

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,310
it's going to be q1 at this point Ashton

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,530
and we do have a couple other boards in

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,090
the hopper under design right now but I

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,730
can't really take the cover off those

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,470
okay fair enough

00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,240
another another question is what do you

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,090
think in the mezzanine situation is that

00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,190
I know you guys do other mezzanine cards

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,040
for other boards what do you think about

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,680
the 96 boards mezzanine situation where

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,670
one one card can work on mold Awards

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,990
yeah absolutely i mean the mezzanine

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,870
card you know the i call it the

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,610
ecosystem is incredibly critical to not

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,040
only developers but to our customer base

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,720
so people can evaluate all the different

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,360
technologies that these boards can

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,030
really you know really open up to the

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,450
world so to speak whether it be sensor

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,810
technologies you know lighting displays

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,180
and so on and so forth and you know what

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,370
we've really learned from some of the

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,459
open source initiatives around the world

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,620
is that the ecosystem is just as

00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,660
important as the board itself if not

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,150
more important in some cases so we're

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,860
fully committed to that we are we are

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,440
working with partners to introduce

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,060
mezzanine boards you know and

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,120
surrounding technologies into the

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,680
ecosystem so Glenn as i mentioned you

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,030
earlier we were talking today I'm

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,610
heading out to the world Maker Faire

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,519
this coming weekend and back in New York

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,290
City and i'll be showing the various

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,570
boards the various people but how does

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,610
era of view makers I mean there's the

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,840
makers excite you to make our fares the

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,340
people doing this stuff what do you

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,549
think David I think the maker movement

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,680
is incredibly critical to two arrows

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,260
success you know as well as the 96

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,390
boards movement you know the reality is

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,160
that are the next generation of of

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,260
customers the next generation of

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,959
developers are coming from the maker

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,180
community and with you know with the the

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,090
new shared economy i like to call it a

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,829
person can take one of these boards

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,350
design something in their basement put

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,510
it on kickstarter and have funding and a

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:59,110
company and an idea in six months which

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,420
is absolutely unheard of it is truly

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,250
exciting these days it is it is and i

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,019
think this will go as far as our

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,660
imaginations can take us so we're

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,430
excited about it fantastic I know I am

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,210
thank you very much for your time with

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,270
ya thank you

00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,270
