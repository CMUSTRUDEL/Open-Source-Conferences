Session Name: OpenSDK OE Builds on 96Boards - BUD17-412
Speaker: Andrey Konovalov
Track: LHG


★ Session Summary ★
One year ago, LHG launched an effort to organize the LHG components in the OE layer and create public builds. This presentation summarizes the work to add LHG specific features via meta-lhg and merge with support from 96Boards OE meta layers. The specific meta-lhg contents are described and how they are combined to create the LHG OE builds on 96Boards targets.

[Music]

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,850
this session is about public

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:22,710
openembedded built on 96 boards

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:32,390
basically my name is sandra and i'm jay

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:37,860
assignee trilogy so my main task

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:40,800
analogies to support public open emitted

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,820
bills which could be accessible for

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,840
everyone not only article licenses like

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,649
that and we use them freely available

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:58,920
hardware which on which these bills

00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:02,660
could be on open emitted builds that

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,200
bond and one year ago in LA but they use

00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:13,830
custom distribution there and why bit

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:17,700
unique thing now we are working closely

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,060
with the bills and miles lines and if

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,689
you know reference platform bills you

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,619
basically know how to use open SDK built

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:32,369
as well because they use reference

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:38,850
platen builds as a base we just did

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:44,810
something and the destroyer is this a

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:50,430
matar PB we just add another image state

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:58,490
all the things being worked on in elegy

00:01:50,430 --> 00:02:02,460
are placed in metallurgy layer which is

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:08,930
now relatively thing aware of compared

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,930
to have a year ago also

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:16,610
this built running Jenkins and they are

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,730
published two snapshots amara.org so

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:27,320
that everyone can just use the privilege

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:29,540
and try them as there are reference

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,470
platform built we don't want to

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,410
duplicate the work and only build one

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:43,820
image with chromium because reference

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:47,660
person doesn't build chrome images as

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:52,040
for the boat we have tabled supported at

00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:56,350
the moment token board for NC high key

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,350
and tis be below Christian

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:14,870
so here are the key components of

00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:19,220
openness to get built we rely on these

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:21,379
pillars from third parties meta 96

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:25,790
boards where is used for high key

00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:28,879
support medical coma as the differences

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:33,829
support and meta gie is used to get a

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:37,750
big log 13 support this is where we get

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:37,750
hardware accelerated graphics as well

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:47,540
the builds are based on mortis but some

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:52,159
components are more recent than the ones

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:56,349
in moti these are distant amazing

00:03:52,159 --> 00:04:00,379
particular and they come from lynners

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:09,290
metal rapidly it lives on getting out of

00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:13,099
the talk 40 we use metal in our

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:18,919
monocular which is up to date and

00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:25,340
currently scheduled of tea to the 320 as

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:28,400
I said eligible need chromium and for

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,940
chromium we currently use a fork of

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,780
chromium version 45 Electric has done

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:40,780
some changes to chromium and also we

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:48,310
have a plug-in to implement open cydia

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:48,310
so that's why we use this one and

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,289
another component required for secure

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,590
playback is the a decrypter which is a

00:04:54,289 --> 00:05:00,340
trusted application and this app is in

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,340
metallurgy

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:16,360
so metallurgy there is available at

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:24,490
github in our forum is the account to

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:30,160
useful energy component metallurgy has

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:32,190
in fact two layers metallurgy with some

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:38,139
specific components developed inside

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:44,440
openembedded here is the least this is

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:49,449
the image though open eyes open up the

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:54,150
cable don't have Westeros images there

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,150
is reception which is used by IDK built

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,900
here is their objects krypter and

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:09,760
basically that that's it we use a for

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:15,250
cosmetic browser with the chromium for

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:21,400
West version 45 so it's not represented

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:25,300
here I've separated some fixes of 0

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,539
grams needed to get some components

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,349
integrated into the build put an inter

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:36,610
separate metallurgy integration layer

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:41,440
this is something which should be absent

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:46,410
an ideal world but there is some and

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:49,120
affixes which we need and they are here

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,220
this kind of reminder that something

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,919
needs to be fixed and proper way or get

00:06:51,220 --> 00:07:00,570
up streamed currently there is not much

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:08,169
stuff in this layer which is good and

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:10,870
mostly it's the variants for Western MJS

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,260
jxd tkm this is the news event driver

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,260
for power

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:22,720
the modification to Western actually are

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:26,720
the YouTube tis bought the thing is that

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:34,000
my blogs in itself but the similar am 57

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:40,300
XX evm bought it had two displays and

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,300
this is required some changes in Western

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:58,130
so some earlier we have more stuff in

00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:02,240
int'l a which is now mythology but it

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:08,270
was kind of common code and now it's

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:17,360
landed in otherwise like meta 96 boats

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:22,490
and meet our PB this year actually in 20

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:27,140
city in 2016 earth we've got Molly drive

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:33,400
for hiking available and finally it has

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:40,060
been editing magnetic boots and to have

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:47,150
to enable Israel hardware-accelerated

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:50,270
service supporting metal baby we ended

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,760
up in heaven EG l dot inc which is not

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:59,390
only for money but power and it can

00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:01,810
accept other GPUs if there are any more

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,810
available

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:17,380
as I said our builds are based on

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:19,660
moieties at the in Jenkins we have two

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:23,080
kinds of builds kind of number ones and

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:28,930
staging ones which can have some more

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:32,610
experimental things in and even for

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:37,780
stating built we still use more teens

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:41,230
not master because otherwise we will end

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:45,820
up in having too many packages and

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:48,730
applications being updated too often

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:53,410
that we would like as we have particular

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:57,400
interest in some areas that's why we

00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:01,210
have for example the end just simmer up

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,280
to date more recent than in multi but

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:08,530
for other companies we are okay with

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:15,550
what is in motion at the moment chromium

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:17,920
is currently an easy after reference

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:23,740
platen built and eligibility has been

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:26,190
updated to new HTC and Alexis chromium

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,340
stopped working now it's fixed but

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:32,350
partially not everything can be can be

00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:38,620
displayed for example YouTube is not

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:43,350
working it and the question is often

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:46,960
arises why we still use version 45 so

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:52,720
excite tried using the person currently

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:56,770
in metal browser there is a an issue

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,320
with the awesome because universe all

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,970
the version of chrome amused intervals

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:08,260
implementation of a zone and it's not

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:10,750
being worked on by Intel for here and

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,600
the well maybe that's why Google started

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:18,640
their own implementation but it's still

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,699
local progress as the result metal

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,859
browser

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:29,079
has split it they split it the chromium

00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:36,139
reciting tattoo the 14 x 11 uses version

00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:40,939
4052 and they leave Wayland chromium

00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:44,449
Wayland recite to use version 48 this is

00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:49,009
probably the most recent which has a

00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:52,389
zone support so even if we switch the

00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:59,559
meta browser we won't get very close to

00:11:52,389 --> 00:12:04,720
upstream krona and I did just one

00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:08,989
experiment and with in this bill time

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,429
kerman of 48 fail to build there was

00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:14,689
some problem with with the header file

00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:18,879
this can be addressed but in general the

00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:18,879
question remains if we should try using

00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:29,329
the most recent version with Google's

00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:32,230
implementation of ozone because i'm not

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:37,359
sure if it makes sense to spend time on

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,359
working with this version 48

00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:47,439
hydroxylated playback in the steamer box

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:51,319
on TV 14 sees it has been broken for

00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:53,829
Weiland but since like the fixes or

00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:57,889
let's go and we should have this

00:12:53,829 --> 00:13:01,299
resolved relation actually have a fixed

00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:01,299
but hasn't tested it yet

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:16,030
so here are the links to the Jenkins

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:19,820
jobs this table built and the stingy one

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:32,990
and here are the links where one can

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:35,140
find the pre-built images there are

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:41,000
short instructions on how to build

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:46,460
images in the readme file in the

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:56,260
manifest depositary this is essentially

00:13:46,460 --> 00:14:00,200
just executing this fo commence some

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:08,090
people from our team reported issues but

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:10,040
so far they were mostly about having set

00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:13,700
up not very well suited for opening

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,680
birds bills at all like they started

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:20,270
with the a virtual machine with just one

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:26,900
gigabyte of RAM there are some point is

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:30,800
at 96 build matrices sorry reference

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:37,480
bottom builds pages about how to get

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,480
through proxies if this is relation and

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,630
some standards open emetic top is needed

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:50,390
including some packages to install under

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:56,630
Bill machine this is actually covered on

00:14:50,390 --> 00:15:02,920
a yocto project web pages so all nodes

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:02,920
should be quite simple if one heaven

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,080
high performance enough machine with

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:16,820
enough space of memory

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:24,860
I think this is basically if there any

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:28,820
questions I can answer so you mentioned

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:31,580
that on for gstreamer mesa there were

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,250
more recent versions than what's

00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:39,620
currently and Marty are there specific

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:41,510
patches or figures that are needed in in

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,630
those exact from a medevac boards I

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:49,510
think they the more recent versions one

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:52,220
aided by DB photon see both they use

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:57,770
again they use hydro excavation and

00:15:52,220 --> 00:16:01,330
their code is for kind of more most

00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,330
recent just humor

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:22,799
so just came back to the cranium recipes

00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:25,449
and things and see sad so they split

00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:29,290
which split the recipes into x 11

00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:31,600
wayland way than one is kind of I think

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,480
the other behind they have decided to

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,109
move forward and they would not move

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,499
forward to with Wayland so they

00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:46,410
separated the x11 rhys ifans updated to

00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:51,309
version 52 leaving her wayland chromium

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:54,489
where it was over hind I changed do we

00:16:51,309 --> 00:17:04,089
know what why that happened I think this

00:16:54,489 --> 00:17:07,600
is an issue Thank You ed the previous

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:10,299
connect there was discussions on on

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,600
chromium and gstreamer integrations and

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:16,899
things like that and the or ozone

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,250
architecture has been haven't been

00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:19,809
keeping much sharper there is

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,779
modifications going on there i think

00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:25,389
part of it has been built in but that

00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:29,919
part is in flux I don't know if they're

00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:31,570
going to deprecate their aura or what it

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,519
was it going to be deprecated and dr.

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:38,799
look and she remind myself which one it

00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:40,389
is so once you know I think that part

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,240
has to settle down before I think they

00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:46,210
can move forward as there is issues with

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,760
it and it's something that we want to

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,950
see resolved at some point I don't know

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:56,429
if there's anybody else here who's been

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:58,809
following the or ozone chromium saga but

00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,490
again when suddenly we're keeping an eye

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:04,630
on because that's why we're still on an

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:08,169
older chromium branch and end is andre

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:11,019
mentioned for the work we did with clay

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:13,779
ready we use the open CDM with with

00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:17,010
chromium so we still have about peace as

00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:22,730
well so that's another reason we have

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,730
some like a fork of it as you mentioned

00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:29,880
to my knowledge sir I gaelia if i

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:34,950
pronounced an incorrect this company is

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:43,530
working on getting a chromium running on

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:51,120
Wayland they worked ideally I made

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:55,170
misspell the name yes I think they have

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:59,790
something working on already but just

00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:05,040
very basic things and they expect to

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:08,120
have something more usable in the next

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,120
half of the CMA be

00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:21,870
ok I think there are no question we are

00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:26,230
done thank you thanks for telling

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:30,950
[Applause]

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,950
