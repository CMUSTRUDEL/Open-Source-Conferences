[Music]

00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,469
right she's actually a Boston you holdin

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,330
a reasonable job of coming to the front

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,680
good seems vaguely inappropriate in this

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:24,560
massive space so Oh does anyone know how

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,560
to make screen move to the next slide

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:34,369
Clyde space right down tight down slide

00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:47,340
on Arab it's got a pause but oh no sorry

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,739
I never uses before right so mostly this

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,690
we're going to argue about triplets but

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,850
this is the cross distro boss so it's

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,280
are any district issues about things

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,530
which we care about which have recently

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,960
become fixed all are still issues we

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,660
don't think of being dealt with this is

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,670
an opportunity to bring them up so we'll

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,560
get to that later let's argue about

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,750
triplets first so I LP 32 is kind of a

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,700
thing and we had a couple of meetings

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,490
about it over the last two days so

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,590
anybody who cares knows most of that but

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,100
basically it's ready we're just waiting

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:27,240
for the colonel people to agree that it

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,590
is in fact ready and dilip see people

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,580
are waiting on the colonel people

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,790
because that defines the API however I

00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,970
noticed whilst building this but because

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,850
everyone has done all the work of

00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,050
building for LP 64 with a Nile pitot

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,710
tube multi-layer it doesn't actually

00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:49,020
work if we just build for iop 32 or

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,790
indeed oil be 52 with an LP 64 multi

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:57,570
look I don't have to our people to do

00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,710
people who do Colonel apos will it have

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,710
the same fiscal numbers

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:17,560
I don't know okay so the point here so

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,080
having done this I kind of noticed that

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,879
we set this triplet about 6400 school

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,480
I'll be due to do or be e on the scale

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,040
be 32 but the point is that the colonel

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,489
never returns that that's kind of the

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,910
machine Colonel part of your triplet and

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:35,560
the colonel is both it's always both it

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,450
will never be one of the other so it's a

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,790
bit weird look it up there oh this is

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,750
just an ABI the hardware doesn't care

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,549
and Colonel doesn't care it's only your

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,840
operating system you know which ABI you

00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:48,430
want to use today which basically

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,610
depends on the lip see that you're using

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,540
and all the libraries you've installed

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:58,750
so it really ought to be in the OS part

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,190
rather than in the kernel part so the

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,930
question is is it bit too late to fix

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,510
this does anybody disagree violently

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,889
that we should fix this but I was like

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,410
so the feedback I've got is that either

00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:10,750
people don't care or they agree I'm

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:20,030
right and it is part of the OS not part

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:24,590
of the machine ok

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:31,580
I haven't known so I've I fail to take

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:34,100
this in who said the lvm oh sorry llvm

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,310
not right yes yes oh is it an lvm person

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:42,950
here who can say anything useful about

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:46,810
what unhelpfully okay so yes so I will

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,810
talk to the llvm people and see

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,890
okay so well the impression I got from

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,720
Renato was that he agreed that this was

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,010
the right way around but we just need to

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,800
check that it wasn't didn't make it

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:26,070
really painful for them so okay I guess

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:26,070
we need to check that yes

00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:59,999
okay it is terrible yes how about you to

00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:02,419
just come up in and near these

00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:12,209
microphone anybody who has the sailing

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:14,789
we have mics yeah yes a couple of Mike

00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:17,099
should do so I want to be Mike runner i

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:22,969
justjust also at the front all three of

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:29,189
you as you want to say anything right oh

00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:31,469
so my concern on this was that the the

00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:34,559
Rams concatenation of letters on the end

00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:37,709
of the goose is unmaintained the balls

00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:39,089
unpossible so when we came to the

00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:42,329
architecture part and which other

00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:44,369
housing extensions there I sort of said

00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:46,829
early on I thought there should be a

00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:49,079
strict policy that we separate each

00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:51,449
extension with an underscore so it

00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,909
doesn't affect the top level passing and

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:57,449
then we have a canonical ordering as any

00:05:53,909 --> 00:06:00,300
extensions so that there is warm in find

00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,309
order for any combination of extensions

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,449
that might exist and for the sake of

00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:05,999
argument that should just be

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,679
alphabetical and that keeps things

00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,029
straight forward and you know where

00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:11,369
you're going and you know what the order

00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:13,169
should be and then everyone can line up

00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:16,339
you're passing a modest stop working

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:18,839
randomly in the future just saying I

00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,249
personally on the ABI issue I don't care

00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,889
whether it is on beginning at the end

00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:24,599
but I do think we should carry over that

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:28,289
sort of policy or something equivalent

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,989
of that so that everybody can buy in and

00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:33,659
understand how to decompose this thing

00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:36,389
into sensible extensions if that's

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,579
relevant and so far but you could just

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,989
ignore it with the star as far as I know

00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,269
that doesn't break anything and it's

00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:43,739
true that most of the historical things

00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,809
on this line have just different letters

00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:48,360
on the end but I don't think it actually

00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:49,289
matters again unless lgm people have a

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,839
problem with this

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:57,089
and so just illustrate the point about

00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,589
why so this works is convenient wow

00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,119
finally my font changes didn't do that

00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:04,919
when I was looking at it I will sorry

00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:06,210
about that so configures a bit of a pain

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,119
if any of you've done this before

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,979
because upstream ships to configure

00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:12,149
files with the software so they're all

00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,559
without a date so whenever you have in

00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:15,360
your architecture is just missing and

00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,949
nothing works now in fact what our build

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,860
systems have fixed this by just over

00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,930
writing them we're doing that in debian

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,159
beloved slow process but the problem is

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,219
if you build up stream stuff it's still

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:29,069
always broken so it is convenient if we

00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:30,629
don't have to fix configure and as it

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,369
happens if you stick things on the end

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,439
configure it's perfectly happy and just

00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,930
shows you the string so then you just

00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,369
have to deal with it whereas if you

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,889
stick things at the beginning it wants

00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:45,180
to identify it so so that's that you

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,619
know it's not huge advantage but it is

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,499
significant if you're actually ever want

00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:54,240
you to make a whole of this in any

00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:55,979
singles with no BS so so in practice

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,620
what you'll end up with is pretty much

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:00,509
only tool chains and the package and RPM

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,610
and other build systems have to actually

00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:06,569
pass triplets everything else just get

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,430
the toolchain defined LP 64 an ILP 32

00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,419
which are conveniently exactly the same

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,699
and x86 and arm so this is beautiful and

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,080
your software will all look the same so

00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,009
an awful lot of software at the moment

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,719
checks x86 64 and oil people 32 but in

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:26,699
practice it should probably often just

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:28,379
say am I ILP 32 do the right thing so

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,659
only a few things having had a look

00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:37,760
actually have already noticed the

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:37,760
triplet for this and use it z

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:46,460
so you said that the only true shame in

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:51,260
the EPK grp mr foster care what about to

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:52,820
open in busy yeah probably care yes our

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,589
build system is actually the other thing

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,630
that isn't mentioned ever you have a

00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:59,720
matter I will be 32 layer where we

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,100
practice things around that usually fix

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,770
yeah so you have a pile of patches

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,660
already but most of those check under

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,399
school and Scott LP 32 whatever it is

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,899
right because the right thing to do very

00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,459
few things actually have to care what

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,490
the triplet was that gave them that

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,750
pretty much tool chains and so the only

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,970
thing that shows through is multi arch

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,880
paths which is annoying so python has a

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,529
if I'll entire 32 then this multi arch

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,660
path and we really also have an upstream

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:27,470
way of setting multi large paths but we

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,149
don't that's a separate subject and so

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,709
there's this thing is like should we put

00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,240
them to score in Richard King strongly

00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:33,560
that we should I think it's a good idea

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,750
unless anyone could think of a reason

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,220
why it's going to break the world so

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,589
adding raise your hand now last champ so

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,670
watch out with lvm people but unless and

00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:48,290
I don't know what they do if they say no

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:50,600
we hate it and argue a bit more and

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,360
that's basically it okay so i think the

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,290
egg another question what is the

00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:01,459
convention for the US cellular reaction

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:04,700
really so the user lib conventions that

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:08,990
have been used is lib oil p32 same as it

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,510
was live x 32 for x86 or live n

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,339
versatile basically it's live whatever

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,839
crazy string people have used in their

00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,880
particular architecture so there's a

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,650
million lib / something architectures

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,320
which is why it's disgusting and you use

00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,209
multi arch but if you're using multi lid

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,270
that's how it comes out and everybody

00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:32,339
seems to be happy with that so so if i

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:35,939
consider system

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:39,540
system tree with the three types of

00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:44,430
distribution I mean in X x86 with with

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:46,939
selfie 64 our Peter TKO and I 38 days I

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:50,399
have the three three types of a

00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:54,930
distribution what could be the name

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:59,220
without the IBI yes Rania so the name

00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,170
will be usually for the 64-bit 30 60 and

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:07,139
slightly on your district so it'll be

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:14,129
little 64 lib and live x 32 on redhat

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:15,870
and it will be lib well now on debian is

00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:19,790
just it is not yet directory so we don't

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,790
do that except for inside the compiler

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:30,059
and you mentioned read that from what i

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:32,939
know the rail will not go for at all for

00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:35,399
i will be 52 yes i said they're not so

00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:38,069
in the end they probably also know so

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,290
there is no problem and there is no

00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:49,800
multi-leaf or i'm creating to the run

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:52,230
and there will not be the answer is very

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,800
simple we we do have a tree already that

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:59,069
is building RP 32 it is all modulus its

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,259
users / result is that RP 32 we have

00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:02,759
specialist and flip 64 we already the

00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,769
current everything to that you can get

00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,220
today even the server products do also

00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:11,160
have a h32 support so we are we always

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,220
all bind it right now we don't ship they

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:18,149
are 32 binary Suns left but you can run

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:20,999
them if you want to run them in in

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,550
general the whole infrastructure for rpm

00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:25,379
and zipper and other packaging around it

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,009
are aware of what our people do in their

00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,009
search you are

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,559
yes yeah I mean you could argue that the

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,480
x86 people should be using live iop 32

00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,730
instead of live x 32 but i imagine thats

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,529
far too late to fix so they'll just be

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:50,180
different and I'm not sure I care much

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:52,249
yeah ok so anything else and I want to

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,990
say about that what we go on to I'm not

00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:59,779
sure that there is much else to discuss

00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:01,850
I have a couple of things ok so things

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,399
I've been aware of that have been fixed

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,980
in distro world somebody turned up the

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,470
cared about Lisbeth amazingly turns out

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,350
the people who make petrol pump stuff

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:16,850
you know Machinery embedded stuffs use

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,620
Arm & D so they complain that there was

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,029
no lid fo box but I'm 54 and we went

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,499
well it needs poor thing has apparently

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,910
is difficult and they had a look and

00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,040
when actually no it's trivial from types

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,499
need setting it was easy and you know ok

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,889
great so that I doesn't have such dreams

00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:33,470
but it appears to be basically working

00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:36,529
inside arm we've been doing some actual

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,720
attempts of dogfooding so arm desktop

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:40,819
trying to make them a thing people ask

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,579
to use our desktops can you can use some

00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:45,949
help feed Firefox into an internal CIA

00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:48,410
loop so we had Firefox working about

00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:51,379
seven times by now and every version

00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,850
update a great every a single one you

00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:55,100
always have an hour had trouble getting

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:59,689
the Firefox people to take patches in

00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,639
finite time that's annoying but it is

00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:04,279
integrate integrate with their see I boo

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,870
yes basically they test in their

00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,179
development branch where their arm

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,329
grades because it's always trivial

00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:13,699
compile fixes but nobody realizes that

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,410
until two months after good really so

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,999
there is a general problem that it's

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,459
been a long time before people could get

00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:21,620
cheap arm 64 hardware as unless VI loops

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,999
on and so quite a lot of upstream

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,860
projects are going well we would do that

00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:26,179
if we could buy a board for 200 quid

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,970
that was any good and we'll build our

00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:30,949
massive C++ project and that has just

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,709
about become true now after line pool

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:35,130
lawyer to do that for them well they

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:37,230
could use a BS

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,790
or they can they can also obviously use

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,070
of years yeah I mean the man we have

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,350
spared this power the whole time but so

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,450
yeah so I mean I haven't had anything to

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,650
do personally with but yes people should

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,450
be running for your loot and I think

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,890
everyone understands that but for

00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,450
various reasons people haven't got round

00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,560
to it and they may not be aware that

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:57,480
they could use OBS or whatever so you're

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,120
writing and stuff like that always

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,960
breaks so they've been scratch is needed

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,580
to make all those things actually work

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,220
obviously spoil I know very few people

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,800
are using desktop stuff yet you know

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,560
martien has a bit we've done a little

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,600
bit in arm but mostly that's not really

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,790
a things yet so there's probably more

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,730
breakage to be found I agree that the

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,890
really fun fact on that is that our left

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:25,800
the I Love Actually run firefox and

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:28,290
glozell in the whole thing so so we

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,210
actively do test these things again and

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,690
notice it breaking through toons4biz

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,700
been great and all time but it's it's

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,350
just an artifact from from basically

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,910
though some legacy that I was the I come

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,860
from the desktop right okay so my

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,540
question here really is other things we

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,010
know of that are broken and need some

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,330
engineering efforts that have been

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:51,300
discovered anyone go any somebody

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,640
mentions video inside browsers last year

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,380
I don't know thats fix it wouldn't

00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,910
surprise me if codecs are working but

00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:09,120
very slow in some instances they are

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:11,850
working okay so easy mustang which is

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,150
quite slow was fine enough to watch

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,760
youtube videos when i was playing with

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:21,110
our desktop over a year ago okay i don't

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:25,080
know what mass spec is mustang ah right

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,720
remember my english yeah sorry I ever

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,760
felt like I said arms great support ever

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,030
since the iphone came out its one-way

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,530
trip yes so let's let's go yes but

00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:38,660
obviously the phone people have helped a

00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,660
lot in making that stuff look and

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:48,370
good question the question was his web

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,370
kit tested named unused WebKit browsers

00:16:53,119 --> 00:17:01,980
right okay cool and so yes the one thing

00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:03,749
I think is the problem is full I'm sorry

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,980
Nana passed first impression i recall

00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:07,110
that you were saying that normally

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,230
strong and it's important to set back by

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:14,459
now so what so what live no no come on

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,709
out now yes my I got fixed somebody both

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,769
Microsoft pocket which meant it got

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,079
released I think that's what happened

00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:23,880
after all as Microsoft Bob somewhere in

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,039
there open source there for objects

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,600
before back end and athletic it came to

00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,980
open source project so yes oh yeah the

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,110
Microsoft they stick something for us

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,019
excellent by applying some cash to the

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:40,289
problem so I think we still have an

00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:42,659
issue with jit and because they all

00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:44,669
assumed 48-bit addressing because that's

00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:48,000
what you get an x86 and we have 47 bit

00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:49,620
addressing the way around it's a

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,029
terrible as a terrible thing so what 52

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,549
is not an issue because music so she

00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,500
only usually gets to a 48 on another way

00:17:53,549 --> 00:18:00,299
of any an ailment for 450 Jewish Jesus

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:03,120
rated on eternal for for the 47 thing is

00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:04,799
basically an issue mostly with with

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,200
JavaScript with the Mozilla javascript

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,059
engine anything else is potentially fix

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,159
these data files i'm away yes sir on

00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,870
alou has been under logically we have 50

00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,580
copies of the missoula javascript engine

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:18,899
from different points in time some

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:20,940
dating back to 15 years it's an insane

00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:23,639
math and the actual fix for that would

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,909
be to just move the projects that use

00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:28,769
those engines to go to newer versions of

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:30,360
the move as Aguas again yes I don't

00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,429
think everybody actually went to do that

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,100
if you won't have a lot of spare time on

00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:37,320
your hands or resources but one thing

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,090
that's basically the only one thing that

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,950
I'm aware of it still making a dozen

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,990
have at least a dumb to fix so we do

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,639
have done some fixes or for ancient

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,610
Moses our JavaScript versions of our

00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:51,210
tree so that whatever sort with policy

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:53,159
kicks like I'm forward is a freaking

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,669
politics on the 10-year old version of

00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,669
the 15 yo

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,490
the 15-year version is only using couch

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,470
TV is personal what's very housekeeping

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,060
couch GG isnt that way bigger likely

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,070
everything yeah I know that you have a

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,530
thick if you have a support so your

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,750
scope you only hear if you have a part

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:15,380
that basically makes it work reliably

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,820
and well being with another village of a

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:23,270
good engine that would better just get

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:26,000
rid of the whole team yes so we've been

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:28,870
working with Jeremy littleton from arm

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,900
and he's done a bunch of porting work

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:36,890
around that it's now fixed in the

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,570
upstream latest and i think version 52

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:42,860
came out yesterday which is a long-term

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:44,450
relief and there's been patches back

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,890
quarters for all the various different

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:53,240
versions of in the upstream Mozilla get

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,330
correct right here and I so that there

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,890
is patches out there in the various

00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,620
destroys that have been backordered all

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:03,650
the way to the 15 year old there is a

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:07,580
whole bunch of different projects that

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:10,130
depend on varying versions Erlang etc

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,430
and Jeremy's also been doing some work

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:18,530
to help port some of those two newer

00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:21,410
versions and it's slow and it's getting

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,780
there but I think that's looking a

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:26,180
little bit better and the other I

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,730
suppose broken important thing that I

00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,650
have on my list is pi PI there's being

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,260
true but knowing Fe they're only pool

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,810
isn't it there please most people apart

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:41,380
from Cavan yeah there's still some

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:44,930
issues with Indy around 128 bit mass

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,000
which was engaged a little bit with the

00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,650
upstream but there seems to be some

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,900
backwards and forwards how best to deal

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,670
with that so it's profile on anybody's

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,540
list that we know that actually wants to

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:59,510
dedicate some effort to it not in this

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,980
room okay fair enough yes so I should

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:05,720
write that down thank you I forgot about

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:08,100
that one and I mean that from like the

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,179
package set that's in fedora

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:15,020
or nearly 20,000 source packages you

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:18,059
then getting sort of into the sort of

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:21,480
prologue and various court lysias

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:26,970
obscure Darius corner case I believe

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:29,490
sort of stuff but I think even those are

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:33,390
starting to get thoughts as well okay so

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:35,490
I think like the FTC Pascal I think

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,140
Angus dream I go to fix last year yet

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,929
yes but it hasn't had a stable release

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:43,559
yet okay so from that point of view

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:45,480
there's very few on my list and most you

00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,620
know with things like mono I think that

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,890
landed in for six with pretty much in

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,600
parody most cases with x86 left okay

00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,850
cool so I guess we're left with

00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,070
optimization tasks mostly rather than

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:06,750
porting now and I don't have a good

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:11,760
handle on how much that is left and so

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:14,820
we also we did find a breakage in the

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,970
gold linker in debian as well right eh

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,010
we actually isn't a problem in stretch

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,380
isn't a problem in Jesse but there's a

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,780
problem in getting back ports that were

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,850
catechol using gold what are the notes

00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:30,299
is Elizabeth a number of packages using

00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:32,760
gold and it was breaking alignment

00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,500
internally but it's already been well

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,720
fixed upstream or at least it's an

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:41,250
issues of which we will be fixing with

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,260
we build shortly okay all right well I

00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,120
think that's all unless anyone can think

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,010
of anything else they care about yes we

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,530
have to have an ARB slide for just any

00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,220
distro related stuff anyone wishes to

00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,220
mention

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:07,929
I'm trying to summon my overdrive and it

00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:10,510
would be nice to kind of yeah yeah yeah

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:15,220
so I can't Lee give a better place I'm a

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:17,559
lead yeah so at the moment it's kind of

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,270
a that's working on getting a machine

00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,559
that actually in a decent states that we

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:23,740
could actually hand it out to scratch

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,830
and say you're using an arm machine so

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,210
it's not really started in anger

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,840
obviously some people use our malware

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:34,600
anyway in Chromebooks basically but

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,220
people have noticed this is a deal so

00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,909
it's good because I'm taking a while to

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,970
get through to the powers would be so

00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:45,340
yeah I think we realized this after we

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,490
release opensuse for the rest of a pie

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,840
for a free and pick to acknowledge

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,880
people started actually using it except

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,110
its disposal father is much more so if

00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,820
you actually target hardware that people

00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,169
have it actually much better than if

00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,679
your target price on a dollar machines

00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:01,510
that people are buy-in date and we do

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,220
see more traction now and on the open

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:06,250
seas are more suffice random community

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,779
people doing things like yeah as you say

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,340
a lot let's get your favourite if people

00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,230
have to use person is broken it tends to

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,809
get sick I don't really usually don't

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,809
really didn't much ever I think have any

00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:18,760
any process where you would say I want

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:20,529
to do that but the cross distro and I

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,659
just have a mailing list but people

00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:24,880
combined 44 are more for main string of

00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:26,740
whatever side it never has an architect

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,490
acidic would always distributions

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,529
decision I don't most people actually

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,390
kind of put along with that way and I

00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:36,669
think it's perfectly okay if s inspector

00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,440
ops women just goes in on this one yeah

00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:39,789
mostly people talk on whichever here

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,350
without their distro list or the

00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:42,730
upstream software list or whatever it is

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,899
they particularly care about which is

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,490
very diffused so it makes it difficult

00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:48,190
for someone like me to know what the

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,539
hell's going on you know there aren't

00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,730
that many things which are arguably

00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,380
actually across distro issue but it's a

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,919
good place to just kind of asked and

00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:59,330
what's going on so basically point is

00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,340
that i've already finally fixed a couple

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,890
Colonel bugs but if I get some kind of

00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:07,760
Nome shells flat or something in the

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:10,340
browser I'm yeah I come for you debug

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,200
yeah there isn't a good central place to

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,710
say have someone somewhere fix this in

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:19,100
some somewhere so the president across

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,630
this drum not going to get flamed thanks

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,220
i'm having we could we could use it more

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:33,260
and it wouldn't piss people off at

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:38,150
anything you know so so i'm back to

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:43,580
open-ended II suppose I am I want to

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:48,530
install the industry with the both LP 64

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:51,470
use alarm and isp 32 years around now i

00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:56,480
need to to to change in open-ended to

00:25:51,470 --> 00:26:00,250
compile 12 thing so yeah so you can

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:04,420
build an AR 64 to change that those both

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:08,660
is either multi-label multi arch path

00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,700
okay so it's a sin compiler for xp64 and

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,840
I MP 38 depends how you build it but you

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:17,090
can build it like that's how it's built

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,470
at the moment and early people would

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,640
like to have food to change the Debian

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,040
people would like you to have to tell

00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,410
James everybody exactly working on this

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,100
is building one tool chain so my

00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:31,120
question is open embedded ready for

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,120
bottling death

00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:09,460
it does it care of having to to to

00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:11,830
change okay because I think that's

00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,469
better myself and it makes life a lot

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,839
simpler if we do let multi living and

00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:18,969
more multi arching but yes time to stop

00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:22,029
so thank you everyone that was useful I

00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:23,710
think and looks like we have sufficient

00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:25,889
consensus to proceed for now I'll go and

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,850
talk to the toolchain people some more

00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:32,390
cheese

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:37,109
[Applause]
