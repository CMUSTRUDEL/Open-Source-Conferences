[Music]

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:23,640
hi everyone good morning so hi I'm civil

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,769
ceremony in Comcast's assignee for elegy

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,029
so this session we are going to talk

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:33,420
about the what-ifs IDK how to put or DK

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:41,700
how we put on ninety six boats and the

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:44,670
challenges we faced so what is how the

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,030
cake so arnica is a complete set of

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:52,199
software software components tools and

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:58,579
documentation required in in process of

00:00:52,199 --> 00:01:03,840
making a standard Linux set of boxes so

00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:06,330
RDK uses yocto ye build build system so

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,450
it's modular configurable to meet the

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,740
requirements of different set of boxes

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,780
like Guam based or IP based or hybrid

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,140
set of boxes and the different

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,970
configurations gateway or media server

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:27,210
or client configuration so like any

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,110
other set of awk software it supports

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:35,340
main set of box functionalities like

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:43,140
live playback live streaming DVR and ESP

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:46,820
playbacks so our DK also supports web

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:51,060
content displaying graphic content

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:56,490
rendering using WP browser so this will

00:01:51,060 --> 00:02:00,780
see ding detail incoming sides so

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:03,860
architecture we we use windows windowing

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,840
framework as well and previously we used

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,190
QT website a WebKit and now we move to

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,220
vaillant so if

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:16,120
if Valen comes into picture then comes a

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,160
question what is a compositor so we use

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,460
Westeros compositor which is a DK

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:28,880
develop and open sourced it's a I like

00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:32,530
alternative to a Western so browser

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:36,410
framework we use WP which is

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:41,600
metrological web geek port or with rail

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:45,620
and support graphic engine so IDK uses

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,800
opengl and y es which which has support

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:52,070
for means hardware I'm which can use the

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,290
hardware acceleration support also so

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:59,290
the main part me media framework ID high

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,270
defines its own media framework that is

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:06,170
RMF ha DK media framework which is based

00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:09,460
on gstreamer which will will see in

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:13,070
detail income coming slides and so

00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:19,180
startup services and that process

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,180
management is done by systemd services

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,660
ok this the architectural diagram and

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,970
you can see how addict is layered we

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,530
have like four layers top one is sat

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:39,410
application where you'll have st be a

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:43,280
standard applications guide all those

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:47,810
things and next part is that core RDK

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,890
gender equality which has that rms

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:56,690
framework browser framework on that need

00:03:51,890 --> 00:04:02,290
for video web graphics rendering and we

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:05,120
have shock and away specific changes say

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:09,110
we have a hardware acceleration on a

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,380
boat that comes in that comes in the

00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:18,200
shock layer and uyen specific changes

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:22,700
will come in OEM layer so this media

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:26,690
framework browser framework and the West

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:33,410
us will see in the coming slides one by

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:36,080
one so this is how to put a DK onto on

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:41,320
any platform so these are the major

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:47,180
blocks identified like media playback

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:51,740
using hardware acceleration and Nexus

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:55,360
Westeros compositor so how Westeros

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:59,720
compositor can be ported on means

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,900
platform using the egl or dles support

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,590
from the harbor and then comes a browser

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:12,280
means we use WP browser for displaying

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:15,860
web page or graphics content on the IDK

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,140
so this other three blocks which we are

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:24,620
going to see in detail one by one in

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:27,230
coming slide okay so Armas what is our

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:34,490
MF MF as I said it's a media framework

00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:37,880
which is loosely based on gstreamer with

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,600
level of abstraction to define RDK

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,810
sources things and folders which were

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,950
required for implementing stp

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:53,390
functionalities so we have like

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:56,960
different sources like DVR qualms home

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,630
networking source DVR sink winds and

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,250
things like divorcing home networking

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:09,110
sink and media placing defense things

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:12,640
but I will take one use case like how I

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:16,630
p streaming playback is done so that

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:21,950
this diagrams over the left hand side

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:24,890
shows how gateway stings so we have

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:30,110
Kwang soos and essentials so one source

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:32,969
will give the impact es content and

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:36,059
hatching home networking social

00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:38,219
stream the content so this on the

00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:43,049
Gateway side and the right hand side is

00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:47,519
on the media client client client box so

00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:52,459
since our boat doesn't have tuners we'll

00:06:47,519 --> 00:07:10,709
see how media Klein functionality can be

00:06:52,459 --> 00:07:13,739
imported on our boots so so RMF for this

00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:17,279
arm of sources and sinks internally

00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:22,559
translating to gstreamer pipeline like

00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:25,709
in our case hatching source uses soup

00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:28,829
HTTP internally and media player sync

00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:31,319
uses a player wing sing like in player

00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:35,299
Bhim Singh plugin is a bin of element

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:46,009
which will have D max decode and

00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:50,849
displaying display sings so how we

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:55,860
integrate means how we put our MF onto a

00:07:50,849 --> 00:08:02,879
platform so we platform has a hardware

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:11,549
acceleration we need to integrate RMF to

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:15,719
sock or SOC specific plugins so on heike

00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:18,029
we don't had a hardware acceleration on

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:21,449
but DB board we had a hardware

00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:25,619
acceleration through v4l2 plugins so

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:28,610
that will see on the ITR with DB both

00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:28,610
specific fly

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,309
okay so here comes Westeros Oh what is

00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:44,540
this was West rumors it's a simple

00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:49,870
wayland compositor like question so this

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:52,759
is a simple lightweight and developed by

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:57,709
means comcast and they open source fate

00:08:52,759 --> 00:09:02,949
and mainly this is developed targeting

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:07,459
the embedded systems so it supports

00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:09,980
similar functionality is like normal

00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:17,240
compositing nested compositing an

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:20,480
embedded compositing like msn so so how

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:25,009
we put vegetables on a different

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:28,370
platform so we VD to implement a

00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:31,879
restaurant sock which provides Westeros

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:36,949
GL & Westeros video sink so Westeros TL

00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:40,730
is for graphic content rendering and

00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:48,009
Lester sink is a plugin for video video

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:54,170
rendering so where we implemented a

00:09:48,009 --> 00:10:08,209
Westeros GL on high key and DB for 410

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:11,269
see using drm kmf support so so how

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:15,589
we're vegetables flow is like west

00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:18,110
roseville and try and try to use egl

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:21,410
support if native window support is not

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:25,069
provided by your user support we need to

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:30,139
implement that well Westeros GL using

00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:32,300
mint on on our case heike and DB for we

00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:36,529
don't have an on-screen egl support so

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:39,889
we implemented the native window support

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:44,779
using drm KMS so that we will see in the

00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:45,980
Heike slide so we have a simple sample

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,940
application to

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:53,060
validate Westeros compositor the West's

00:10:49,940 --> 00:11:00,140
test application and these are some of

00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:03,470
the code links so as I told it's open

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:06,830
source component so it's available get

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:18,110
up and you can do contributions through

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:22,370
quote dot R DK central counts so WP so

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:29,480
WP is a metrological port of standard

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:35,480
web greet with waylon support so WP is

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:38,780
used for rendering web web page graphics

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:44,240
content or video content on web page web

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:48,200
pages so W beeping can be ported using a

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:52,400
veil and egl support from the vote for

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,460
graphics rendering and gstreamer plugins

00:11:52,400 --> 00:12:04,490
for video content rendering on the web

00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:07,760
page these are the both we already

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:14,570
ported we already coated or DK on high

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:20,290
key dragon boat photon sea and on 820

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,290
see we are in process of putting our DK

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:37,770
so this is how we put it on high key so

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:40,560
as we as I said we don't have a tuner on

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:45,630
the high keyboard we put it a media

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,990
client build on high key so we used a

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:57,240
opto two dot one means crow grad branch

00:12:48,990 --> 00:13:00,810
and so meta RDK is destroyed by itself

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:13,830
so we don't need a means external disco

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:19,680
we used it as a distro on two dot one ok

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:24,060
so the graphics integration is done by

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,970
integrating arm mali for 450 user or is

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,850
al and libraries and we don't have a

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:33,660
hardware video acceleration so we use

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:43,440
the software playback video playback on

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:48,050
the Heike these are the some of the

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:53,010
issues and challenges we faced on nike

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:58,050
so so migration issue is like Matata

00:13:53,010 --> 00:14:02,870
case a sea-based distro but we put it on

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:05,070
a two dot one crow grojband so we had

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,650
migration issues with some of the

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:16,950
components like the swimmer light is

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:19,650
each DVD and WP dependencies yeah so

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:26,010
Westeros previously doesn't have a

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:28,890
support for DRM KMS so porting on high

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:34,580
key was not that straightforward we had

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:39,630
to implement drm KMS support using a GBM

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:41,500
so that be implemented since it doesn't

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:47,560
work straight away by integrating

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:53,430
DJ libraries on the browser side we have

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:58,230
like video positioning issues we used

00:14:53,430 --> 00:15:01,270
glm async on the web kick media player

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:06,930
repeat media player so portioning was a

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:13,390
issues since GL amazing does not have a

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:18,400
positioning so that we saw using

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:20,410
Westeros Inc yeah so performance issue

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,410
was there with media playback since we

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:27,160
use software video playback kind of

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:37,200
don't have a have a hardware

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:43,000
acceleration on high key so this is with

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:48,430
putting on a DB for 10 C so some of the

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:54,730
steps are similar and with respect to

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:59,110
specific DB per port and see related

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:02,260
stuff so GL es libraries that graphic

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:06,070
support here is provided by a Mesa free

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:08,230
enter driver so we had like some of the

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:17,730
challenges which will seem next slide

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:21,300
and so here we data RMF integration with

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:26,370
hardware video acceleration through

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,370
gstreamer v4l2 plugging

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:42,149
yeah here is the some of the challenges

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:47,100
we face on DB for open seen Addison to

00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:51,569
the whatever we did on high key we had

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:55,500
the v4l2 compatibility issues things we

00:16:51,569 --> 00:17:00,959
use for linear flow for dot for kernel

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:05,579
and IDK uses gstreamer one dot for dot

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:08,160
for version so upstream v4l2 plugin was

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:16,260
not working but we had to use a custom

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:20,040
old v4l2 yeah so WP had a voting issue

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:24,569
like since Westeros doesn't provide

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:29,340
off-screen he GL target for Mesa the

00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:32,190
fallback mechanism which WP had but pee

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,370
pee before pixel buffer that is also not

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:39,990
supported in Mesa so we had to implement

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:48,299
our off-screen et al target for Westeros

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:53,480
only for Mesa back end so the video

00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:59,669
positioning issue is same like high key

00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:02,100
we had like playback issue so WebKit

00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:05,100
media player has a different pipeline

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,380
audio video and takes pipeline so the

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:11,820
text pipeline and the native video

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:14,880
pipeline was stalling the AV playback so

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:18,530
we had to disable that so which which is

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,530
one of the issues we face

00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:36,299
yeah I need any questions thank you and

00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:43,200
what is the generic license for the

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:47,099
whole package rd cajun rig license so

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:52,769
yeah so the gender card EK their

00:18:47,099 --> 00:19:09,749
licenses are using articulations addict

00:18:52,769 --> 00:19:17,729
am so it's like so busy it's like

00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:20,220
community where comcast is generally of

00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:22,529
taking certain portions and open

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,869
sourcing them and so it's it's a steady

00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,909
march their their goal is to have our DK

00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,979
completely open source with apache to

00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:32,070
license I Blues what they're targeting

00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:33,809
so they're like on the RDK the broadband

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,869
gave way that the networking code has

00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:39,739
all been up streamed the the WebKit for

00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:43,379
Weiland is is an open source project

00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:46,289
again it's coming in pieces so it's a

00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:48,239
large corporation that is you know

00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,309
moving in that direction but like I said

00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:52,529
they're there is a license agreement

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,470
with our DK there's a lot of people who

00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:56,729
use it and they don't actually deploy

00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,320
new products but they use it as a

00:19:56,729 --> 00:20:02,340
reference or they may be compared their

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,859
own products against RDK but there's as

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:09,690
we say a steady march towards getting

00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:12,830
the entire code base open sourced from

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,830
comcast perspective

00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:19,480
can't off the top of my head I'd have to

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:25,120
go back and look at currently what's

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:28,210
there yeah do you know they have plans

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:38,380
to open source that gender equality but

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:41,289
we don't know how products the changes

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,889
that you made in Westeros and to support

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:47,799
the phrygian a driver if we try to sort

00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:49,809
upstream those back to get hub also get

00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:54,100
her projects yeah we have seemed to

00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:59,769
matter logical WebKit for Valen okay I'm

00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:01,139
and my other customers is there any this

00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:04,899
already taken with any kind of

00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:10,929
middlewares of gooey stuff when you have

00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:14,830
it all running user interface yeah rd

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:17,559
Gators amendment that Emma so part is

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:21,159
CPC component means comcast proprietary

00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:24,820
so that they are not giving means and

00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:30,059
that IDK license XO so Emma so can

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,059
develop their own user interface

00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,059
no some other operator can deploy

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,349
already came and then put their own

00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:59,320
guide on top of it so the the guide

00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:02,200
interface I'd like the base components

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,090
vs and rain wait but once reported it

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:10,179
you don't get us nice so shiny but does

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:15,179
urz is the RMS is there is not just some

00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:18,460
sort of basic like we have a sample

00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:24,940
applications to validate the RMF you're

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:28,359
kidding yeah so for graphics browser

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,749
also we have a IDK browser servants

00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:40,899
which is available and under that

00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:42,399
articulations which actually I don't

00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:45,299
know their question is the right

00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:49,239
question to ask so I think you know for

00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:51,940
broth ancient so I think most people

00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:55,029
like the brink the common blue ink so I

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:59,999
just don't know why rbk still keep use

00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:59,999
web kate is any special ability for that

00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:07,989
can you coming okay okay i just say you

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:11,940
know for the RDK is still used to WebKit

00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:15,700
as a rival engine right but you know a

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:19,929
lot of open source bolger just move into

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:22,599
the brink call me blink i still know is

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:29,019
there any special reason for rtk to keep

00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:31,089
use the web page so i don't have a means

00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:36,669
straightforward answer they have a

00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:39,909
little chromium link also but they found

00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:43,019
this is better I mean if it has the

00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:46,389
performance wise as well as when you

00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:48,609
blink implementation thus taxes is more

00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:50,919
and the performance is also not that

00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:56,019
much what they expected so they stick to

00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,890
the ideological WebKit here but I think

00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:01,140
mark

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:04,060
something yes so in LH g we were

00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,730
proposed in chromium blanket Bay in that

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,240
was comcast planet record-- to go to to

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:14,260
blink however a couple things happen one

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,840
is they decided to backport two older

00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:20,110
set-top boxes that were more memory

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,080
constrained and as kalyan mentioned they

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:26,710
were disappointed by the the flip the

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,100
code footprint size and some of you may

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:31,390
know you know chasm was working on that

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,860
chromium browser project and part of

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,610
that I think was still try to resurrect

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:39,820
which is to really get the the code size

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,650
so it was really the performance wasn't

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,190
quite what they thought and then also

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:57,640
the the main issue was the the foot the

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:59,480
code footprint any other question okay

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,890
thank you for watching me

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:08,859
[Applause]
