[Music]

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:20,130
welcome this is a bird of a feather

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:24,570
session let's start this is going to be

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:27,269
an open discussion the guidelines are

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,490
that we have a couple of slides to set

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,219
the stage set the background or for the

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:42,239
conversation and then open the floor to

00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:45,239
input from from other participant few

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:51,510
weeks ago in the month ago number than

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:57,170
that we got inquiries from two members

00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:01,109
from the light like group the IOT team

00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,969
about looking into open source embedded

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,969
graphics for cortex-m microcontrollers

00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:10,590
these are some snapshots of some

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,770
existing embedded graphic frameworks

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:20,130
running on cortex and so this is the

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:22,979
kind of graphics and you may recognize

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,580
some use cases that may be of interest

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:34,020
to to the members so this is what we are

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:37,740
we have try to look for so the idea is

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:43,320
to look into what can be accomplished

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:46,950
with cortex-m class devices several of

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,850
the available cortex especially m4 have

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:55,049
an embedded to the acceleration IP in

00:01:50,850 --> 00:02:02,759
Hardware some to do it equally well in

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:05,729
in optimized software code so we have

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,119
been looking at the offering on the

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:13,890
cortex and side and we have been looking

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,810
at the tens of graphic frameworks into

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,150
look is that that are available for in

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:23,550
bed then specifically for cortex and

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:29,640
devices out of the tens that we have

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:32,220
looked at only one or two maybe somewhat

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,890
open source software there is one which

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:43,350
is really true open source software only

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:47,070
one so open questions either a value for

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:50,430
linaro and our members to work on an

00:02:47,070 --> 00:03:04,050
open source embedded graphics initiative

00:02:50,430 --> 00:03:06,630
for cortex-m along I get a minute so

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,450
i'll show you the list of course XM

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,269
devices that we had looked at and the

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,060
list of the UI frameworks that we have

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,550
looked at and the the harder primitives

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,480
that all functionalities that are

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:24,600
supported and then the feedback that we

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,700
will be seeking from the audience is if

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,890
there's a values there's an interest for

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,320
you to see an open source and better

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,720
graphics frame work done as part of the

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,790
narrow or maybe what is available is

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,920
cheap enough and good enough and and

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,570
you're not interested in an open source

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,750
framework but nevertheless you may be

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,310
interested in a common set of 2d

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,620
primitives that could be deployed across

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:57,780
all the member cortex and devices and

00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:00,060
use with the graphic vendor providers so

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,130
that it can be easily you can easily

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,820
pick and match cortex-m and UI

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:13,890
frameworks so these are the inputs that

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:16,650
we are we are seeking today so this is

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:20,100
the the list of cortex and devices that

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,010
we have been looking at those four are

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,140
those that have interesting to the

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,090
acceleration capabilities I'm reporting

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,600
public information that you can find

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,330
from the

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,340
web I'm not disclosing any confidential

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:36,570
information from any member so

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,990
everything is is public from from the

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,790
search engine so those four are those

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:47,640
that have interesting to the

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:50,640
acceleration capabilities this is more

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:55,440
or less the summary I'm not pointing at

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:58,830
of course which SOC is providing which

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,800
acceleration we're always staying at a

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,840
furnace level with all the members but

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,490
in a summary these are the features that

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,640
are supported the basics are bleating

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,130
bitmaps then you can do bleating with a

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,830
great modify right so you achieve

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,680
blending you can go far as far as

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:25,530
feeling with tangled zone on the display

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,290
or copying areas from off screen to on

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,720
screen or within the screen itself some

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,670
go even further and they provide the

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:39,860
ability of drawing lines or polygons or

00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:43,050
even carbs some even have anti-aliasing

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:46,200
alpha blending texturing which is pretty

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,800
pretty wild for a cortex and but it's

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,990
available most have multiple hardware

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,180
layers so that you can have one layer

00:05:51,990 --> 00:06:00,270
for the graphics one layer for some

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,740
provide some imaging capability so

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,020
that's where you have multiple layers

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,340
some have a text layer and the graphic

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:11,550
layer some provides hard workers support

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:16,170
so it's the old good sprite from the old

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:23,820
days in one case I have even found

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:28,610
specific Hardware font rendering we

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,110
which can be achieved anyway with the

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:34,860
rectangles bleeped and blend if you have

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,110
the phones as monospaced fonts in in

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,479
memory with an alpha channel the platter

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,950
is is good enough so i'm not sure if if

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,020
hardwood phone

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,390
enduring is a specific feature or is a

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:51,270
reuse of the bleacher but anyway this is

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:55,290
the summary of the CHS I was fooled and

00:06:51,270 --> 00:07:00,420
it was fun in one case I had found an

00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:04,830
accelerator that was to the advanced

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:07,440
animation and control engine and that

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,410
was even providing a start point and

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,570
point speed framerate animation that was

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,060
pretty powerful and then I discovered

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:18,870
that well that was a cortex a plus

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,940
cortex-m and that acceleration was for

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,950
the cortex a bart and the cortex-m was a

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:28,350
coprocessor so i was totally off track

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:31,710
on that but was interesting anyway this

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:36,770
is the least of the graphic buscas that

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:39,690
had looked at micro GFX and then

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,020
expressed logic gooey acts which which

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:46,590
is a takeover of prisma that some some

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:52,640
know sega the company in Germany

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:55,680
building the low-cost JD buggers and and

00:07:52,640 --> 00:08:00,180
they have recently come up also with our

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,910
toes and other embedded libraries microm

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,920
those from the micro cos they also have

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:10,440
a micro see GUI interesting enough the

00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,440
same snapshot from the website is

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,420
available from sega and my chrome it's

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,490
exactly the same snapshot so i wonder if

00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:21,960
there's any cross-licensing between the

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:24,060
two touch the effects tara systems iguru

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,440
and peg are interesting and now it's

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:32,660
come to that in a minute in ninety-nine

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:36,450
percent of the cases source code is open

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,640
but it's not open source you can get

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,960
source code but you have to pay for it

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,940
there's a commercial license associated

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:51,810
no royalties but there's a prepaid

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:54,400
buyout enery which ranges from sixteen

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,080
hundred dollar to up to 20 k depending

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,690
on the theaters that you select from

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,570
from the offering from the menu and

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:06,760
depending on the expected volume of your

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:10,210
product so they all support the standard

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:17,620
widgets I'm not listed them Radio check

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:21,490
box all sort of list sliders also

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:24,070
performed well most old support

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,790
anti-aliasing some support multiple

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:34,120
display as interfaces toward the display

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:36,000
controller some go one step further and

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,580
they provide additional widgets like

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,010
gold that's more for industrial when you

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:48,280
see the pressure of the vault I've seen

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:54,610
one case the toolkit is able to create

00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:56,920
on the fly to our code one tool kit is

00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,650
providing calendar couple tool keys are

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,480
providing a virtual keyboard so there's

00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:05,770
a common set and then draw extensions

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:11,130
depending on industrial control hm I

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:14,560
panels or more consumer all provide a

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:18,550
ide environments with an emulator

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:23,280
running on a PC some it's windows only

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:27,640
some its Windows Mac OS and Linux and

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:33,940
they all provide a GUI design tool on on

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:36,340
on the pc on the code size it buries if

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,640
i'm not wrong six case should be the

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:44,230
minimum wrong code or execution calls

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,750
that that is required run depends on on

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,090
which modules you enabling the build and

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:54,580
the size of the screen and and the color

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:57,430
that of audio of the graphics so as I

00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:03,540
was saying they are all under commercial

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,540
license but one no royalties

00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:27,730
yes yes the all these frameworks are

00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:31,990
tested against different articles and

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:34,420
different 2 chainz so you find the usual

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,490
castle usual suspects the usual suspects

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:42,009
on the other side and the usual suspects

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:47,500
on on the two chain that's correct what

00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:50,769
else one of these is purely binary not

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:54,339
the source code is not open and you buy

00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:57,069
pre-built binaries all there's one all

00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:04,269
the others provide source code with you

00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:08,639
as part of the license ego e GUI d4d is

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:08,639
the only one that is truly open source

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:15,040
i'll upload the presentation every every

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,509
logo is actually a hyperlink so when you

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,449
download the presentation you will go

00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:22,779
directly to the web pages ego e is the

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:28,779
only one that is truly open source it

00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:32,019
was initiated by freescale in 2014 i've

00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,959
downloaded the get it's on I think it's

00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:38,680
on github so I downloaded the kid and

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:41,860
the first comment was from 2014 the last

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:47,199
comment from december 2016 so reasonably

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:52,480
maintained its around 70 or 80 commits

00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:54,339
overall and it provides the basic set of

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,490
all those functionalities and each it's

00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:01,449
released under the lgpl with a specific

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:04,899
additional clothes that the library can

00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:08,709
be statically linked with any other code

00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:10,389
with any other licensed so the the lgpl

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,100
is applicable to the changes that would

00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,589
be done to the e GUI but does not

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,490
propagate to any other component that is

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:32,140
linked with

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:35,770
I think 33 I think v3 so this is as far

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:40,300
as my setting the stage go I've got to

00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:44,860
mikes so I would just like to go around

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,020
and and get some feedback from from the

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,140
people in the room if if you have any

00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:53,920
interest at which level an open source

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,950
framework which include up to a GUI

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,529
design and emulator or if you are not

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:03,490
interested at all or if you are interest

00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:07,980
maybe in the set of graphic primitive to

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,980
be shared as a common base across many

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:25,029
in a couple of cases they they have a

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:27,430
hardware acceleration layer yes specific

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:30,970
for hardware acceleration and already

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:34,690
imported with at least one cortex an IP

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:39,880
and I'm sure one is Express Express

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:41,980
logic GUI X and there's another one I

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,140
should look into into my notes but there

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,290
were at least two which specifically

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:51,550
support hardware acceleration all the

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:54,700
others have primitives with typedef with

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,070
structures about pointer coordination

00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,240
the usual usual suspects some are in C

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,240
summer in C++

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,430
I've looked at various bits of software

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,330
when I was looking at Zephyr and to use

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:17,480
and I an STM's cube Stefano and that

00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,460
allows you to kind of pick and mix and

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,720
press a button saying i want this

00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,880
someone that want the other and it

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,460
generates a bunch of code that they

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,410
didn't compiles and and I guess that the

00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:37,779
graphic stuff is linked into that is

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:43,250
part of the offering yeah you're welcome

00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:46,339
indeed we understand we make available

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:49,790
for customer of the solution of it now

00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:51,770
we ask am 32 is a songs to God pretty

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:55,910
popular on the basically all this guy

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:58,010
besides egoism and sauce well even if I

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:22,010
wait wait even better than ego is yeah

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:24,080
it is available on the skin 32 yeah I

00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,900
think many cortex and support many

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:37,310
frameworks and there's a pretty good

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:40,850
coverage the prison is one condom yeah

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:43,790
well on this so what we see from outside

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,850
Lisa we see some women for for graphics

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:49,640
but what participa means that I mean in

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,680
terms of Technology complexity of course

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,870
the routine shield evolved over time and

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,330
so on so let's say nice on I shall also

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,330
depend on you know when you see but

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,680
there is a revolution that the

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:05,150
technological requirements I need is a

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:08,240
we see quite stable as mentioned by by

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,370
andreea and other pixel we have some a

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,209
barracks at a relatives in all cases

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:20,459
20 DNA we basic functioning is that

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:31,800
andreia on the emotion Alan is purchased

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:36,270
additional started now in terms of open

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:41,970
source you mention there is not so much

00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:44,550
solution at all well aware and why is

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,800
the status of league-wide not so clear

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:52,490
to us I must admit that is greater when

00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:56,070
you want me to so either with something

00:17:52,490 --> 00:18:00,690
pointing out on the review establishing

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:03,420
on the market next to 20 by the EP we

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,670
approach is to have a platform available

00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,530
for all the solution so we look at some

00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:14,600
supporting it but so far there is no

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:17,429
confidence another one is peg peg light

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,270
which is developed by a software

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:23,550
division of nxp freescale and it's

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:27,150
available on the commercial licenses on

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:46,710
all cortex-m and available under free

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:51,540
license for NXT customers so the many of

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:54,780
our parts don't have direct LCD pins

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:59,250
directly so people still do graphics but

00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:02,090
it's well it's it's I to see your SPI to

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,410
an intelligent device right and so

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,630
acceleration doesn't make any sense in

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,370
that in that environment the any

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:12,390
acceleration that needs to exist needs

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:17,490
to exist on the far end of the wire but

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:22,170
you know I think those you guys look

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:24,029
interesting i think the UI's demand that

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,840
we see is pretty

00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:29,549
simple and you know even if you want to

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:40,739
make it look pretty it turns into blitz

00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:42,989
instead of drawers yeah it would be

00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:45,629
interesting to me if we had something

00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:49,559
that we could point customers to a if

00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:51,299
you have grow our stuff you know here's

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,840
here's some interesting things you can

00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:57,479
do and how to set up so what we did

00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:01,919
provide to our customers it's a bsd

00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:04,349
license graphics primitive library that

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,229
gives you you know the basic primitives

00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:09,659
so you don't have to code them yourself

00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:14,849
it's BS be licensed and they can do with

00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:19,669
it whatever they want it's I don't know

00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:24,869
the burning need to to change this but

00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:27,119
the other thing on yeah my intuition

00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:30,059
says our customers would be allergic to

00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,580
anything that was L gplv3 even with that

00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,679
license right even be too i'm worried

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,109
about because it means you end up having

00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,289
you know the code distribution problems

00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:43,379
for the end product you know most these

00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:45,989
guys they're just now coming into a

00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:48,269
strategy pretty stable and that kind of

00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:50,089
bsd comfortable because it's dr lies

00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:53,190
Billy we were Apache your some

00:20:50,089 --> 00:21:02,249
permissive license is good I you know

00:20:53,190 --> 00:21:05,070
I'm not once you go beyond this part

00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:06,779
then you end up in the occult XA and

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,759
you've got a whole other thing going on

00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,519
so there's like so lump and then there's

00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,649
cortex a but I wasn't thinking about

00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:17,429
that until i was listening to aundrea

00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:19,859
talk the another area where this is

00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:23,700
potentially interesting is cortex a

00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:25,919
where we do have a GPU but running an

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,179
arts off yeah so when we're running in

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,249
our toss on cortex a maybe we they do

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,890
want to draw a simple UI and you know

00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,260
maybe they don't want to use the

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,510
the GPU to bring that into the code base

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,840
that my dick but still being able to

00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:44,120
have a mortal cute Toltecs cute well he

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,600
used to be trolltech cutie used to be

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,910
quite yeah look with the move to GPL rei

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,220
kind of mix it up even there is a

00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:56,180
commercial buyout for Cutie round and

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,130
that's the business model but yeah some

00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,540
customers may not but yeah you're right

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:07,160
that would probably be a good winter

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:10,250
there okay set up to the library's is is

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,440
what you see as well your what the eye

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:17,180
is providing and what your customers are

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,280
looking for so any any value in possibly

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:26,540
looking at a common set on libraries

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:28,160
across across lite we'd have to

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,310
understand what we got from that right

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:35,660
so there are problems right if if unless

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:39,440
TI goes and integrates r2d api into each

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,360
of these you know it's a problem for our

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,900
customers that want to use that right so

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,320
that would be an advantage like I said

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,180
most you know the if the graphics

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,630
hardware is actually in your chip you

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:57,410
can do all the work if the customer is

00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:00,830
connecting an ITC or SBI based graphics

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:04,520
board well each of those you know that

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:07,130
the way they you know they're all

00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,030
different they all have weird pixilation

00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:13,490
techniques and things so there's how you

00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:17,810
translate your in memory frame buffer

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:20,390
out to the SPI and do that is his per

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,790
device so having a library of things

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:26,270
that people could easily adopt different

00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:31,160
device and end end devices would be

00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:33,080
interesting I this is not a burning

00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,050
desire and TI that we're going to put 10

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,000
engineers on right it's that might say

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,350
how good it'll tape and every time you

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,240
bring out on youtube you make sure it

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:47,350
still works yeah thank you

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,630
oh it's not really a comment but an

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,130
advertisement for chorus or for a

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,809
session that's going to be on friday

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:59,250
from ten o'clock to 1042 1025 it's

00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:03,429
entitled a functional open GPU upon arm

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:05,920
it was a comment I made to Professor

00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:08,830
sufouh that you can make a GPU out of an

00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,520
FPGA and it's very much later two of his

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:19,140
students had done that all the code for

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:22,270
making be OpenGL compatible GPU will be

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,420
open source and I invite you to come and

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:27,460
see the talk this has been done before

00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:31,020
the Intel platforms as far as we know is

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,020
the first time when a no I'm platform

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:45,580
okay so the last few days I got input

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:49,210
from and chat from bills Eric Rob who is

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:51,070
busy in a meeting I also got some

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,590
comments from gang would you like to

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:56,920
share your thoughts if you want I can

00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:01,330
project it slides or you can share your

00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:05,200
your comment actually ours requirements

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:08,410
a very similar tool to view yes for the

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,990
Khorasan based chips we we have very

00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:15,190
simple requirements regarding graphics

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:19,110
so constantly oh we don't we don't need

00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:24,850
anything and we may need something to

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:28,200
text display but that's all for coffee

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:31,809
time but for we do have some part of a

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,330
cheap running our toes and so it's the

00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:39,790
same thing and we we need graphics we

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:42,730
need you I for that and yes though this

00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:47,650
system survey is very interesting for us

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:53,850
well and we stink we hope we can have

00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:56,460
some function do i but country is

00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:01,660
adequate for us so I I cannot

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:06,280
you find accurately so but it's good to

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:17,830
have the full function you I first ok

00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:19,630
thank you thank any comment from arm so

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,890
I mean obviously these things like

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,800
coming in the future but I'm in the

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,850
certainly looking at trying to make the

00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,660
mali-400 small enough to fit in the

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:30,760
embedded device space and I mean if if

00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,470
linaro went ahead and created a

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,250
framework that was open sourced to

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:38,980
support 2d graphics we have agreement

00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:42,550
that we could link that into the

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:45,310
hardware acceleration so there is

00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,990
certainly interest in the industry for

00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,520
this kind of thing even down on the

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:56,170
cortex-m and definitely on the small

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:58,180
cortex age yeah yeah we I was going to

00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:02,740
join in on bsd or Apache is the place to

00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:06,100
be I mean yeah I mean if you in this

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:15,490
color suppose here yeah yeah no nobody

00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:17,410
wants GPL but obviously it kind of what

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:25,360
we actually do depends a little on the

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:28,080
pool from customers when you would

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,720
create a software to the framework

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,120
library with ability to configure to him

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,890
into a whole layer that allows for a lot

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,750
of acceleration because what the Molly

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:48,520
accelerates is different to what or the

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:52,000
PA it's very stable area during 2d

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:56,740
functions is I don't think it's that

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,710
difficult problem so I'd be curious to

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,270
know just from the SOC vendors with

00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,270
wouldn't they work with these various

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:06,760
companies is there a burden that put on

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,720
you or these companies take it on as far

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,210
as supporting your hardware and as

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,929
a benefit that would be seen by having

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:17,179
some common interface you know towards

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:20,000
reducing porting efforts and so forth

00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:50,299
even to these commercial products in

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:53,320
this space any of these frameworks

00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:55,880
support our use case directly where

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:59,750
you're just creating a frame buffer and

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:06,049
then viewing out updates over an SPI

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:09,370
link yeah some of the framework I don't

00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:13,309
look any API of everyone but in a couple

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:16,010
I've seen the in the configuration of

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:20,960
the library you can select whether it's

00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:25,309
a display with I think with the embedded

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,429
memory or you had to enable the auto

00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:38,780
refresh in the in the LCD controller of

00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:40,309
the SOC I mean I know what the question

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,919
has come up about whether Zephyr

00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:44,929
supports a graphics library and the

00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:47,720
common is we're happy to take one we

00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:49,970
don't have one today I don't know

00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,010
whether or not it makes sense to engage

00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,570
with these commercial entities and

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,960
having them look at having Zephyr

00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:59,659
support is the way to go forward versus

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,429
you know and I think that's part of the

00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:07,539
conversation here it's just how much

00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:07,539
demand really is there in this space

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,210
right so that's it that's a very good

00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,340
answer right that kind of says how much

00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,440
cost it is to you guys right from what

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,030
your customers are demanding of you that

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,160
it's not such a burden that you're like

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,230
a you know from an engineering

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,590
perspective this would make sense to try

00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:40,300
to collaborate on to reduce our costs it

00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,220
doesn't sound like that from anybody it

00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,470
sounds like you know you guys invested

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,060
whatever was invested a while ago and

00:30:44,470 --> 00:31:05,680
now it's really maintenance on top of

00:30:46,060 --> 00:31:09,300
that may be another way to look at it is

00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:12,850
laws of the way so by my athletic llamar

00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,590
some GT or under King interest to look

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,020
for something that could fit in this

00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:34,180
area we can think that they will also

00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:36,520
focus um I haven't seen any GPU vendors

00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,750
I think we've seen more system companies

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,020
you know people trying to build

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:42,430
something on top potentially looking for

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,530
probably needing some simple graphics

00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:46,720
display support and just that we don't

00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,970
there's not a use case or an example

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,890
that today was ever so I think it's just

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:55,540
a matter of as separate progresses and

00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,580
so forth they think whether it's again

00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,350
an integration with what one of these

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,930
whether it's maybe we do something's

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,270
done with a GUI you know as being an

00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:07,210
open source you know integration just to

00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:11,890
demonstrate a capability more than

00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:14,290
anything else at this point so the

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:18,280
action that we could take off today is

00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:21,040
to keep these on the agenda monitor the

00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,429
evolution and keep synchronization with

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,429
Jane

00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:08,550
okay okay so we will keep this for

00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:14,160
further updates in the future lights

00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:16,370
giving committees thank you thanks

00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,370
everybody

00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,619
