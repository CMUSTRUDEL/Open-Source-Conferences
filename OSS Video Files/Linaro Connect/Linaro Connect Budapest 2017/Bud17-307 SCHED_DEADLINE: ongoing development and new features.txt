Speaker: Juri Lelli
Track: Power Management


★ Session Summary ★
After deadline scheduling for processes (SCHED_DEADLINE scheduling policy) has been merged in the Linux kernel in Mar-2014 (version 3.14) a considerable effort has been put into actively maintaining it, but no further development really happened after that date, until recently.
 
In this presentation, Juri Lelli, after giving a (very briefly) review of the current set of features, will deep dive into the details of all the new features currently under development: CPU capacity and clock frequency scaling, bandwidth reclaiming, coupling with clock frequency selection and cgroups support.
