Session Name: KVM/ARM Nested Virtualization - BUD17-301
Speaker: Christoffer Dall
Track: Virtualization


★ Session Summary ★
Nested virtualization, the ability to run a virtual machine inside another virtual machine, is increasingly important because of the need to deploy virtual machines running software stacks on top of virtualized cloud infrastructure, as well as for prototyping and testing. As ARM servers make inroads in various deployment scenarios, being able to support nested virtualization on ARM is a key requirement, which has been met recently with the introduction of nested virtualization support in the latest ARMv8.3 revision of the architecture. I will present the initial effort to introduce ARM nested virtualization support to KVM/ARM, which involves adding significant logic to core KVM/ARM code, MMU support, timers, and the GIC emulation. I will also briefly discuss a paravirtualization approach we have used to prototype and evaluate the implementation on current ARMv8 hardware without hardware support for nested virtualization.
