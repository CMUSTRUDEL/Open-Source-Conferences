Description: 
	"Session ID: BUD17-508
Session Name: ARM Developer Systems/Tools - BUD17-508
Speaker: Martin Stadtler, Graeme Gregory, Ard Biesheuvel, Engineer, Yang Zhang
Track: 


★ Session Summary ★
The ARM ecosystem needs full stack development tools, currently you need an Intel machine to develop for ARM. This makes developing for ARM a 2nd class citizen. The need is shown greatly in the datacenter where we need developers and engineers to start working on ARM as a 1st class citizen. To enable this developers need access to ARMv8 based development systems with UEFI and ACPI capability.  From small NUC like devices (with expandable memory and SATA ssd/disk), to ARM powered notebooks and workstations (that provide PCIe, SATA and DIMM). Finally ARM server access as cloud/baremetal instances for production testing.  This session is to gather requirements and review options that can be provided/developed.

[Music]

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:19,260
to collect your requirements as a simply

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,930
put some to do what to do ourself a good

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,699
arm based native development machine so

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:29,609
we are happy to use of reasonably happy

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,650
hour I'm not looking for to everybody to

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,730
really really happy but if we can make

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,290
something everybody's exciting about

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:40,530
that great but what we want to do is one

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,559
of the most talked about topics into

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,090
this connect and actually since last

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,590
connected why do we have to continue to

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,149
tutorial the factor in your arms being

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,910
second citizen in terms of the for

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,730
developers you know to the point where

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,710
we have so many very good resources why

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,390
do we have to give you the next 86 is

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:07,020
the cross compilation and to do any real

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:10,560
on base development so thus was

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,840
researching the full we don't have I

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,299
don't have a lot of slice as i said i

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,990
just use excuse i renew i'm supposed to

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,060
be speaking the two minutes ago but this

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,909
is this release which we have talked

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,450
quite a bit among certain groups are in

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,460
ro that what we like to see so if i were

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,350
to put my money my own monies down say i

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,040
want to buy an arm development machine

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,670
what do i want to see on desk we come up

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,759
with cup of different category actually

00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:47,340
the warm which is entry level OIC even

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,939
even entry level which is in turn up

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,350
looks like SBC with us with a reasonable

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:58,950
how we're specie wrapped inside second

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,229
category is the one which we think would

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,899
be good enough for us to use or

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,329
developer pc and that's the one which i

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,800
like to focus on to talk today to talk

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:13,530
about so and again this is not a typical

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,100
session where I talk a lot and you

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,270
and most of them doesn't make sense and

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,940
so this is such a where you raise your

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,660
hand and tell art tell me what you want

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,240
to see what is that I demand you really

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,709
want to see if there is a machine such

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,209
machine comes up and do you want me

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,540
obviously do you want to see such

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:36,420
machine comes on so that's it suppose

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:50,370
yours raise your hand if you want to get

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:53,820
something so I want so I want to see the

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:58,280
machine armor seeing which can are

00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:02,489
supported their own normal SATA or mini

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:06,180
PCI Express so that we can sitter story

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:11,580
other the street for build because the

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:14,640
emmc is usually very fragile for the

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,900
build process because we usually of

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:24,620
those the binaries repeated reasons yeah

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,620
it will be nice to have the the storage

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:36,720
we picked up out in way we take the box

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:42,690
here maybe I should just finish I think

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:44,790
we've been for the various man for a

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,130
develop a system that people actually

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,489
want to use us think we've come very

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:53,370
soft pass that by now nvme is the

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,250
requirement for a thing that people want

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,900
to use so I'm really sorry Zoe nvme

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,600
storage is regret that means more than

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,700
one pcie slot so you have one for GPU

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,700
and one for anything storage

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,430
and of course that would be an m2 slot

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,560
but having lots of pcie slots would be

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:28,680
sufficient so that would be a list and

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:33,780
key I NGO ng yes yeah okay good point

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,000
thanks so one thing I'm concerned about

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,550
is that if we're going to come up with

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,199
something so it's not just a developer

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,110
machine where you can do your work but

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,970
it's also people that are knowledgeable

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,220
about this Hardware can actually find

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:51,330
them fix bugs if we're going to have

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,220
something with a real tech tip y ou T

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,020
DPC on the board I'm sure we're going to

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,880
find lots and lots and lots of bugs in

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:03,000
the realtek driver but nowhere else so I

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,639
would prefer to focus as much on fish IE

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,310
good well working pcie with much of

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,590
slots and putting as little as we can

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,410
fix on the board or fix inside the slc

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:20,099
so we can really avoid the monoculture

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:30,770
of only having a certain combination of

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:36,060
peripherals and never anything else so I

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:39,120
think that one of developer stuff it's

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,120
sure it's really awesome to have nvme

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,990
but it's really really awesome to not

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:49,860
spend one thousand dollars on hardware

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:53,360
so sure for me as a developer who is

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,880
using a big micromass tank I think that

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,800
something with with even mini takes

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,389
format which is available on the market

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,970
I will give me power to connect to say

00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:08,880
that storage I can connect SSD for

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:13,590
example to get to hit fast storage and

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,590
quite cheap one as well to normal dimm

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,979
slots for memories I can buy in a store

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:23,250
at the corner so now ECC for Christ's

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:28,380
sake no ECC

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:32,860
when I one day I looked can i buy ECC 60

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:37,780
16 gigs a team in polished or computer

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:40,920
stores none of them had them I don't

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:45,840
know stores which sell server hardware

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:49,210
so I'm not able to buy a ccd memory and

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,790
if it will come in park then some people

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,840
will want eight some people will want 16

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:59,380
some people will want 128 gigs of memory

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,290
just rappin I want ECC sure you want but

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:06,610
I would like to have it optional yes yes

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:08,860
I right I'll see we wish to go out this

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:16,090
type of activity workstation no you're

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:17,800
200 quid busy so definitely we need to

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,200
be looking at something with real i oh

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,390
you know not the usual crappy mobile

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:27,280
chips with soldered on two gigs of ram

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:29,410
and also not not just LP ddr4 because

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,840
that means that double excluded them

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:38,730
stuck too so gigabit ethernet yes pcie

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:46,090
slot so you can add even more ethernet

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:48,910
how many USB slot see talking yeah try

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,160
for wait till it enough if you have

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,080
enough pcie slots you can interchange

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,850
them to some degree if you have pcie you

00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:02,470
can always add mop you more USB if you

00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:13,450
need them use of the USB a bit does fall

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:17,560
down with a monoculture problem so alchy

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,210
ddr4 means that we cannot have dim let

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,150
that would be mutually exclusive you

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,700
either have a very small LP ddr4 that's

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:30,820
fairly slow or you have very fast and

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:33,250
big ddr4 dimm there's also a software

00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,469
side for this please God we need to have

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,190
everything upstream we want you if I

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,190
support oops

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,180
okay thanks that's a really good comment

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,279
um I do want to offer the half way and

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,520
again the projects from being delayed

00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:00,880
but I want to focus a bit of a time in

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,899
the soc choice which is kinetically in

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,510
the room so I have presents Christ spent

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,180
a lot of time and I know some others

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,970
odds and left I would put you know with

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,550
you down quite a bit in discussing what

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,200
actually are the good candidate for this

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,440
whole thing could we can use to build

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,540
this machine I must mean that we need

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,760
your guy's help because so we didn't

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:29,260
came up very good ones obviously this is

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,410
what we came up with anyway so that's

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,420
one far from my well and he know you

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,180
don't know ready decimal well networking

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,950
community board which was butanone is

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,209
exposed specification I can tell you

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:45,940
that but officer Leslie Nara and so

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:48,810
there is no else SOC with D as a

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,420
reasonable entry-level performances of

00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:56,140
57 cool i remember the second option is

00:09:52,420 --> 00:10:00,550
fighting this is a chinese so7 higher

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:05,290
end server chip the last the third one

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:09,279
with nvidia maybe we are not the first

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:12,400
choice if we want a very friendly open

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,550
source community acceptance as a start

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,690
the reason because we went for these

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:23,140
three candidate is because that we have

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:27,010
not able you know we have not been able

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:30,040
to convince these three to come up and

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:34,380
engage working with us being coke on

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:38,950
carrion and high silicon tissue have

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:41,680
developments or rented machine and to us

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:44,560
also it's been a bit disappointing but

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,270
you know that's where we're open to

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,350
suggestions here in some several short

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:52,800
so let me start by saying that

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,440
or he said is not a software question

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,030
it's a harder question if those guys

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,980
don't want to play with the community

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,820
then they are out of the list it's that

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,040
simple only if they want to play

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,110
upstream then we have to promote these

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,910
people into that kind of voice if they

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,450
don't want to play what are we talking

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:15,090
to them what's the point we already have

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,950
to have boards 96 boards and all the

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,500
others that they don't have anything

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,330
upstream and it's just impossible to

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,940
work with them so what easily narro

00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,260
doing with these people you know isn't

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,990
the point of Leonardo to tell these

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:33,450
people stop hiding so I'm not actually

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,420
disagree with that point I mean the

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,550
world is seeing why I mean everybody

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,140
knows what everybody listening this room

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,150
in the Narrows important notes that so

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,340
96 bull was a very controversial concept

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,860
from the info now so I'm not passionate

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,990
no I don't mind actually I read on this

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,550
because I think everyone should know the

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,990
fact that I probably not the most

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,150
friendly person you would ever meet but

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't remind people so different view

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,920
okay that's plus the fact now the point

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,950
I'm trying to say here we are not trying

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,890
to make a king here with this exercise

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:07,530
this exercise trying to build something

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:09,720
we can use ourselves obviously it's

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,270
related to the you know all the standard

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,030
abs combines the new year file is again

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:18,270
of course its relation to come but our

00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:20,850
focus here is to have a machine we are

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,950
happy with we can use stable enough

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:28,320
which we don't have to fiddle with it

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:31,440
all the time right so that so there is a

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,520
hard one comment we need so that's why

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,680
that's why some we do I mean we do stuff

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,300
with then start from these three I must

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,980
mean we did it's always with because

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,470
these three wood panels or enterprise

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,600
our reference platform do have a you

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,960
know better better than those guys in

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,890
terms of color and boot architecture but

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,590
the hard fact is either be very cautious

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:57,810
or we just told not to the right people

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,180
to enable them they also say on hard

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,910
well as I said you know we are still

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,590
trying but we're looking for help Oh

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:11,340
any other suggestion well we are open to

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:13,650
it so SOC choice any good ideas I'm not

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,940
sure if we can rule out rockchip rk3188

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:22,710
in the latest Chromebook doesn't have a

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:24,950
lot of ram it doesn't have pcie which

00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:31,980
can solve a lot of the other problems

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:35,730
our k 3399 it doesn't have PT ie it has

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:39,600
pcie and USB 3 which is the main thing

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:43,110
that has going for it and it has the

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,080
only has two cortex a 72 s as far as i

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:50,070
know so it's also like it has some some

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,320
small cars on the side but so it's that

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,710
that would be the absolute low end I

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,930
think but it has reasonable carnal

00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,340
support because I'm all the work at

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,440
Google and the Chrome OS team is putting

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,280
in there and rock chips has is working

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,410
upstream for that so on the low on the

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:13,110
low end that would be my first choice i

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:15,420
think on the high end this is this is

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,340
not something that you would enjoy

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,710
building kernels on because it is the

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:26,070
only two cars and is limited by ram I

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:28,500
don't know human has dual channel LP

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:33,090
ddr4 and you can see what the largest

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,890
chips are getting it for that it's no

00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,020
it's it's the high end of the mobile so

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:47,460
it's certainly more than a lot of the

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:49,470
other mobile chips no I mean I have a 24

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,130
co-opted run right now is to replace

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,680
that I would need a 64 core cortex a 73

00:14:53,130 --> 00:15:00,420
or something which doesn't exist so

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:04,560
you're not going to make me happy so

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:09,120
that's the like where we find the

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,220
balance between affordability and the

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,830
performance you want I mean we can try

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,740
to have four socket server chip in there

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:20,550
and try to make it silent but

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,860
what cost what I mean we we did give it

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,440
a girl with AMD right we did it give em

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,470
Diego about eight months ago with Zeon's

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,480
you know we call cello board with a

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,630
server chip with fork or turned off we

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,890
did try it but then well now won't

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:41,190
didn't go well so there is a choice of a

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:44,880
server chip part it does not have a good

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:51,360
well not does not have a mutant the best

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:53,730
call so it's a 53 cool I mean I'm not

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,680
sure how much of you actually have

00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:00,540
specific comments and so what call you

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:03,480
using about a 53-52 sorry it's a fifth

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:07,230
of a 53 it's not as how first master

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,110
remote mostly referring to 57 72 or 73

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,760
century but I don't know whether but

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,100
that's the only server chip which we

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:18,240
found today are willing to engage with

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,860
us I can't aliasing name because you

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,660
don't want to reveal but that's the core

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:27,200
itself for history page 24 call so he

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,959
said about we may try to make it silence

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,490
don't because if you try i will put a

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,470
heat sink on it and you'll be crap

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,339
heatsink and it would burn and whatever

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:45,720
so design the chip and the heat sink and

00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:47,430
the fan please put a fan in it right

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,190
that's a fine that puts water cooler I

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,860
don't care but design needs to be cooled

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,260
externally because the people put like

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,930
achieve plastic on the cover and then

00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,000
they don't convey the heat well and then

00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,790
the heat sink is crap and it makes no

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,470
difference so please design it for heat

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,470
sinks and and active cooling

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:25,660
even though third-party heat sinks as

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:37,300
well yeah ah yes actually four five

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:43,660
dollars yes all right here the usual

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:46,090
cello for winter unfortunately I had to

00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:50,170
agree with him on this one last tool

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,150
actually okay um yeah what would erode

00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,500
looks for the Clarion parts because the

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,830
canary move near started pushing their

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,450
low-end server stuff yeah 18-6 much

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,900
lighter levels it will have Kevin

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,580
Tebowing the rule but I was expecting

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,200
that you know you're like me typing for

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,330
boards of this toy sorry but we will

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,750
exert a really have a conversation with

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,670
Roy so in true talk over you up so I did

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:18,130
have a comedy Viceroy this week they are

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:20,800
actually interesting using particular

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:24,100
later so hardware to day and they have a

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,680
good army person I say but but I have

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:31,660
get have been having that same answer

00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:33,820
for a lot of six months so the kvm chips

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,460
that they are selling is lack of it air

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:45,100
so to support which could be a problem

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:47,740
for certain people yeah i mean my

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,200
experience is done obviously you

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,580
probably know what did a lot of boards

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,670
i'm sketching a little ball so

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:57,100
experience tells me if a soc Wendell

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,720
keep telling you they wanted to do

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,270
something but not to the gas that is

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,370
done in more likely it's not going to

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,790
happen right it's just commitment it's

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:08,320
not there so so I'm not saying we're not

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,580
going to go for those guys but I'm

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,800
telling you the fact is they are not

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,110
engaging we have a problem of actually

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,270
getting a proper slc I just remembered

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,250
one more one more SOC that just came out

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,950
which is also on the small and that's

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:27,220
the the broadcom BCM 40

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:33,010
seven 449 449 something something

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,750
something that only 149 the it's for

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:44,700
wireless routers it's also on the low

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:47,440
end quote be 53 that has pci express has

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,390
okay that sounds about right now that's

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,780
too long okay times would take a look

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:55,120
yep so I'm not just throwing problems

00:19:52,780 --> 00:20:01,120
with at you I do have a proposal to make

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:03,610
here which we said I think we have a

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,680
pretty good handle on the interface we

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,570
won't explode with developers right you

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,050
guys developers you know what you want

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:13,510
and I don't know as much as you got what

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:16,120
kind of know little but problem on this

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:20,440
long is SOC choice I think we all create

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:26,950
that we do have a way forward we do have

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:29,830
a way forward is by not going to the

00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,950
full length with the first build I'm not

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:35,110
I know what I'm protocol a to that

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:40,450
what I'm trying to say is in absence of

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:43,750
a IDs NC choice would you guys be okay

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:47,440
with you know for us to start get

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:49,900
something out first let's say with a top

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,380
hand mobile chip for instance with a

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,470
high end you know embedded chip which we

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:59,260
were using on network device with the

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,510
goose of your support as well so long as

00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,800
it has appropriate support and we're not

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,860
having to fight and do all the

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,480
development for yourselves yes so as

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,770
background you probably know this not

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,470
probably not everybody else here knows

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,240
life and I on a bunch of people started

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:17,020
a company two years ago to try and do

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,490
exactly this we spoke to oddly most of

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,430
the companies who you've listed there

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,930
for their SOC s all of them said yes

00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,510
we're really interested we'd love to

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,530
help but we can't do it commercially we

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:31,120
don't see any money in it so you know

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,970
the issue is either you're fighting with

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,840
mobile people who do not care about

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,420
getting things up

00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,940
stream and we've been told this or

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,710
you're talking to server people who do

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,770
care but they're going to want a

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:47,080
thousand dollars a chip yeah absolutely

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:52,330
I think that's a crime so a lot of

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:55,480
challenges here so again I think you I

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,520
do know that power history that this but

00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,990
I think we are now arm development

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,230
developer community and now to the point

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,840
if we can conceive we continue to stay

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,600
where we are right now they'd be happier

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,910
to contend with cross-compilation call

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,890
be contending with we have to have 86

00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,690
brand new on our desk this day then

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,350
we're going to come so what I'm saying

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:23,530
is what I'm saying yes but doing this

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:27,330
one might be difficult right but we can

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,330
probably make this one happen very soon

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:41,440
the problem with this is right so I have

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,950
nothing you can't finish that sentence

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,440
so so what I'm trying to say that are

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:51,520
compromises we have to make such as GPU

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,100
and others so so we have a compromise to

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,680
mate but while trying to get to

00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:00,880
agreements cause a lot across this room

00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:04,210
is based up our best efforts research so

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,990
far to build an idea pc today is going

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:10,060
to be hard with a cheap half enough we

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,360
want use on daily basis there is a

00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:17,890
server chip as i said 24 call plus a 53

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,230
and it has limitation we see how far

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:23,770
that one goes that one could potentially

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,510
be a low-end I don't know how Willie you

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:33,460
will be willing to recompile the kernel

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:35,140
on the future yeah the actual core cpu

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,510
is probably one of the least important

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,270
things here as long as you say low

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,980
powerful lots of cause is fine so long

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,480
as you have sufficient memory to make it

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,730
usable so long as you have working

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,290
graphics so long as you have the working

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,660
other interfaces as we said peace

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,400
I USB starter you know the normal

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,160
standard interfaces that's what make

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:59,420
will make or break this yep running it

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,520
we're running into my session here if

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,890
we're doing this one it has to be

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,440
Qualcomm that's the only one that has a

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:09,440
GPU the other the other two are ruled

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,720
out already and by the text that you

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,220
can't attach another GPU and the one

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:21,950
that on there doesn't have opens all

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:27,110
support these chips don't have PCI

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:29,090
that's the problem and that was very

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,580
that the other side that would be the

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:44,320
second slide that it was on there tx2 is

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:47,090
that that would be the second thing and

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,320
and among those I would totally go for

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:54,050
the Marvel because the Armada 8050 is a

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:57,140
very nice chip you can turn off all the

00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:59,090
10 gig Ethernet and use the the physical

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:03,530
lanes or PCI Express we have lots of PCI

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:06,260
Express slots and you can put anything

00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:09,800
else on where you want Roy you wanna see

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:21,650
something on behalf kayvyun I'm sorry I

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:23,300
can help I saw you walk in the room i

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,150
don't think i'm authorized to say

00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:29,120
anything that i think this is this is

00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,220
something that that you know i'd like to

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,320
see us support you know again I have no

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,940
influence on on business decisions like

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,570
that but i think it's it's complicated

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,820
to you know bring something like this to

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,080
market and really support it well is is

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,030
we want to make sure that we can provide

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,230
you know if we do get involved with

00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,450
something like this it needs to be

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,940
something where we can provide you know

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,920
a good end user experience and that's

00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,980
challenging when you know if we're

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,570
targeting the the server market and were

00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,430
then making basically an enthusiast

00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:00,200
board you know they're going to use it

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,240
in ways that we weren't you know

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,430
planning

00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,780
so you know that can be challenging from

00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,820
a support perspective and I know that

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,790
you know user experience out of the box

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,280
has been you know problems there have

00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:15,250
been difficulties with that another

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:31,990
ninety six boards you know so you know

00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:49,060
if we can't do that right but we're

00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:50,860
targeting these engineers not yeah maybe

00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,480
but you have to think that that's maybe

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,010
the engineer view but if you're a

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,810
marketing guy and that you now see a

00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,210
whole bunch of forum posts if it's like

00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:01,840
this board I did it it didn't work and

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:03,550
you search in type in you know blah blah

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:15,730
blah you get a whole bunch of bad press

00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:22,780
that bet we're running we running 10

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:24,670
minutes over so um it's worth trying to

00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,620
get an idea with potential numbers for

00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:30,580
this if you're talking to SOC vendors as

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:34,120
well again having gone down this route

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:36,250
slightly before and talking to people at

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,280
conferences talking to people i work

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,990
with the arm though are hundreds to

00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,810
thousands of engineers who were already

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,060
saying to it to us here have money when

00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:49,420
you know please have my money i want to

00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:51,400
make this work if we can get someone

00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,570
somebody to actually engage with us

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,190
there is a wheel market for this and you

00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,210
know that's the difficult thing that

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,120
you're going to have to convince them

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,160
off so i think support is also another

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,650
thing you know if there's a 96 board

00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,780
foundations handles all support for

00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,520
everything and I don't think that

00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,290
broadcom's much involved in raspberry pi

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,150
day throw the chip over the wall don't

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,190
even give you documentation and somebody

00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,259
else's and

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,110
everything else that's not really i

00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:21,059
think that we know so again Marvel is

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:24,059
the one that has documentation for their

00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,370
chips that has upstream support and they

00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,230
have can tell your chips and small

00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,850
numbers that what they have going for it

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,740
otherwise it's it probably doesn't

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,779
compete with yeah I mean we do have a

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,929
combined you wish you knew it go through

00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:38,750
these are just two reason we're over

00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:43,559
wrong with proven you to work in rubra

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:46,740
we are looking to know butte north of

00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:49,379
perfect but a good enough I mean good

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,600
enough machine developing machine for

00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:53,820
arm developers from our main tea with

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,039
developments where you are willing to

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,789
use turn on every database it doesn't

00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:01,740
have to buy x86 machine that's a target

00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:03,690
I don't think we will be able to

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,299
conclude this discussion based on the

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,179
fact I'm 10 minutes late please do get

00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:11,220
in touch with me or well any single

00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,240
longer dinar employee good because

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,220
you'll know where to find the right

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,169
people we do want to continue this

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:20,370
discussion I want to say well Martin

00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:23,250
before closing session the way of

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,750
working i prefer it before we find the

00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,179
perfect solution i'd like to get

00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:29,639
something out there first right that's

00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:32,250
why I don't mind criticism but I what I

00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:33,990
do mind is silence where you have

00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,059
nothing to comment you have nothing to

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:39,059
collect feedback with so what I'm saying

00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:41,850
is let's do something first may not be

00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:43,529
perfect so we if you are all agree with

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:48,480
me that's something I would be pushing

00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:50,039
forward right away ok so I'm my yeah

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,440
that's good idea so I will be creating a

00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,890
mailing list so so for all of us who

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,080
willing to sign off on you

00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,790
you

00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,790
