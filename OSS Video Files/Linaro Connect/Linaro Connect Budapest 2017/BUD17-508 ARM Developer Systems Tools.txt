★ Session Summary ★
The ARM ecosystem needs full stack development tools, currently you need an Intel machine to develop for ARM. This makes developing for ARM a 2nd class citizen. The need is shown greatly in the datacenter where we need developers and engineers to start working on ARM as a 1st class citizen. To enable this developers need access to ARMv8 based development systems with UEFI and ACPI capability.  From small NUC like devices (with expandable memory and SATA ssd/disk), to ARM powered notebooks and workstations (that provide PCIe, SATA and DIMM). Finally ARM server access as cloud/baremetal instances for production testing.  This session is to gather requirements and review options that can be provided/developed.
