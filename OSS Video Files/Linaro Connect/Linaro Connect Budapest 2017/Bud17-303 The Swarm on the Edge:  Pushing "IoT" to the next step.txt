Speaker: Marcelo Knörich Zuffo
Track: LITE


★ Session Summary ★
Sensory swarms of an IoT can be wirelessly interconnected to interact with the edge of a cloud, and offer an unprecedented ability to monitor and act on a range of evolving physical quantities. The Swarm leverages the paradigm of independent, cross-niche and heterogeneous devices that can cooperate with each other in order to execute tasks synergistically. The Swarm architecture is device-oriented, focused on machine-to-machine communications. The Heterogeneous Broker is responsible for dynamically recruiting resources from the cloud; allowing information aggregation to make or aid decisions; and then to dynamically recruit actuation resources. In this talk we will describe our experience implementing and deploying the heterogeneous broker developed by USP in partnership with UC Berkeley. An special focus will be given to the 96Boards program.

[Music]

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:21,320
good morning everyone thank you for

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:26,820
attending my lecture this one is about

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:33,450
this warm how many guys had heard about

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:36,809
the clouds everyone IOT everyone and

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:43,410
about this warm someone had heard about

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:46,520
this form so i will talk about the same

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,190
steps but from a different perspective

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:57,660
from a bottom-up prospect not throw on

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:59,809
top down so basically is that i'm

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,730
talking about a joint project between

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:06,470
the University of Berkeley and the

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:10,530
degrees of San Paulo Brazil and

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,869
particularly we had established a swarm

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,820
computing lab at the University of San

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:21,360
Paolo and here's the picture of my

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:27,840
Center so this one we have forms

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:30,930
everywhere inspired by the nature so in

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,990
2008 professor youngja by a professor

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,520
from derivative berkeley had proposes

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:42,950
his idea he start to observe that in the

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,899
edge of the clouds I mean everywhere

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:50,840
trillions of devices are appearing every

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,790
day and the cloud doesn't fix everything

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,600
basically the cloud is a centralized

00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,619
approach and we have many barriers when

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,149
we mentioned in a near future

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:08,210
integrating trillions of devices and

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:13,340
another thing that is really important

00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:16,370
there is a lot of computing resources

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,870
available in the edge and we are not

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:24,650
exploring them they are just there in

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:27,770
recent years we are very wise it on the

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,170
cloud but we're forgetting that there is

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:35,060
a lot of resources is cut right around

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:39,860
and we're not exploiting them so this

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:46,190
forum approach try to to fix this

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:49,570
problem so as I mentioned before current

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:53,890
IOT approaches are quite centralized and

00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:59,150
that leaders to several scalability

00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,770
barriers usually when we centralizing we

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:07,760
cannot control everything at the same

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:14,570
time imagine how and organized itself or

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:16,880
the end farm or bees on the hive at the

00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:21,530
same time there is a lot of computer

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:24,470
resources memory processing storage take

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:28,160
a look in the last 96 boards that we are

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:31,310
developing indeed community and imagine

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:36,050
when we multiply these nine six boards

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:39,380
by millions or maybe more boards imagine

00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:43,930
the amount of computing resources memory

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:47,740
storage networks available and the cloud

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,740
doesn't answer for that

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:58,390
so our main goal in the long term is

00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:03,520
building a framework for collective

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:06,410
organic intelligence what means organic

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:12,260
we can imagine that all these devices

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:16,030
together they can somehow swarm like

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:20,799
insects and eventually an organic way

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:26,150
they can do or perform complex tasks

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:30,370
that is our final goal we can see that

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:34,270
in nature animals they swarm they self

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:39,110
to protect themselves against a predator

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:42,740
for example we can swarm our devices to

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:50,090
protect us against hackers to protect us

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:54,820
towards our privacy so inspiring that we

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:59,000
group a number of verys is much

00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,540
professors engineers and students and we

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,460
are trying to understand how this one

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,850
where we have this cooperating node is

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:13,340
cut red in the whole infrastructure they

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:17,270
can help human life so our vision is

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:21,650
that we can have a swarm computing

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:28,310
behavior on transit on public

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:30,919
infrastructure and even more so our

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:40,040
approach is really inspiring in

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:46,960
communities of living living agents that

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:51,020
can somehow swan so the idea is that

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,910
insects are very simple from the

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,280
intelligent point of view and also they

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,830
have very limited resources if you take

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:05,360
a look on a single end

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:08,640
they had very limited intelligence force

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:13,440
energy and communication but together

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:16,410
they do Marvello things so that is the

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:28,050
idea behind when we designed an effect

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:30,480
that's a way to see the IOT so our focus

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,360
is to make these devices or these

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,420
insects more intelligent and then

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,990
eventually they can perform complex tax

00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:43,530
on organic waste so when we mention

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:46,890
organic we want to have a systematic

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:52,590
coordination of parts so in the end they

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:56,130
can behave as an organism so we are

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:59,850
designing this worm OS this form

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:04,160
operating system so this operating

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,160
system need to have the following

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:11,700
features need to be interoperable need

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,270
to support somehow a mic rakhana me

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,910
that's something very interesting to the

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:21,290
business model of the cloud is very self

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:25,140
establish it but we still need to find

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:29,280
different and other approaches in terms

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,890
of the storm economy and since we are

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,890
talking about trillions of devices we

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:39,540
are our approach is again a bottom-up

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:43,140
approach so we believe on a micro

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:47,610
economy of devices sharing the resources

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:49,560
between them keeping some traditional

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,190
concepts like the quality of service and

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:57,030
a rewarding mechanism so eventually in

00:07:53,190 --> 00:08:01,110
future I have I a smartphone here with

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:04,890
some memory and then someone else needs

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:08,409
memory so eventually our devices can

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,629
share these resources among them

00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:15,069
of course we need to think about

00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:19,449
security and privacy and finally what we

00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:23,379
call it scope or maybe the global

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:27,639
discoveries so insects they need to know

00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:33,250
the positioning the ownership and they

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:36,310
priorities so in terms of

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:40,659
interoperability our approach is what we

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:43,029
call a semantic mediation service in

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,860
micro economy has I mentioned before we

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:49,829
are focusing on the quality of service

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:55,029
and a rewarding mechanism and insecurity

00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:57,790
it's also related to semantics but also

00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:00,819
we had a problem of performance because

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,680
nowadays most of the security

00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:04,629
infrastructure available is quite

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,660
expensive when we consider a very simple

00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:11,199
royalties and they need to be also real

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:14,889
time so some of these solutions are

00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:17,949
still very open and finally in terms of

00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:22,180
scope or global discovery we want to

00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:25,060
give a multi-level approach where a

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:28,269
given insect can understand its

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:31,899
geography for example my 96 board can

00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:35,079
understand that it is in Brazil it can

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:37,269
have a relative positioning for example

00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,389
my device could be 20 meters from me and

00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:46,300
finally the semantics ok my devices

00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:48,730
under my theory generators and again we

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,819
are looking to a micro service approach

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:56,470
so we are trying to decompose everything

00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:59,740
on a very small grain so how we are

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:03,040
making that viable the responsibility of

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,319
us be in these partnership with UC

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,209
Berkeley we are responsible for the

00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:14,980
broker the broker is the soft piece that

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:17,410
do the mediation among all devices so

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,230
the broker is distributed heterogeneous

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,290
and language agnostic

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:27,810
so in the end we want to pour the broker

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:30,270
to virtually any device and audis form

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:35,550
aware features are being implemented in

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:39,660
the broker considering that we are

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:42,630
considering the 96 boards our target to

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:47,760
pour the broker until now I had

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:52,880
collected something like 296 boards on a

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:57,120
very heterogeneous way we have verbal

00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,600
guns that we have high keys we have

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,380
dragon boards we have also some aspirin

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:09,030
pies we have family major high keys you

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:12,720
make your guitars so we want you to

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:14,430
deploy our operating system considering

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,960
a very diverse and heterogeneous

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:25,980
environment and we had considered the 96

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:28,920
board has our main target so everything

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:33,030
is going very well by the third quarter

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:37,140
up 2017 we hope to have the first stable

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:41,520
version of our farm aware that again our

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:45,840
focus it is a broker and finally I want

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:49,850
to emphasize that this one is a novel

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,740
and a complementary approach for ILP

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,810
it's quite well suited for high

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,200
performance cable IOC's in the edge

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:02,610
that's why we consider the 96 board our

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,740
main target another's moment we are

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:09,510
discussing some deployments and some

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:14,370
demonstrations so we are targeting home

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:16,620
automation traffic safety solar energy

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:21,330
management and finally water leakage

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:24,660
management I live on a very big city 19

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:27,480
million people and water management and

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,360
water leakage is a key issue in

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,339
big cities so the water department of

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,579
our city is continuing to use the same

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:39,660
approach to manage water leakage in that

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:42,660
big city so II here we have some

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:45,329
publications I showed us include some

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,570
publications and I see some people take

00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:50,670
pictures a very nice reference is the

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:54,240
seminal paper of professor in Hawaii

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:58,170
from 2008 and I am available for

00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:15,300
questions and discussion thank you very

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:20,699
much any question oh yeah this is a very

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:23,449
important question because it's a

00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:28,529
different kind of operating system

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:31,620
because we should consider the legacy so

00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:35,399
the idea is not rain linking they will

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,470
create a new kind of operating system so

00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,889
the current deployment that we have it's

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:44,910
a kind of router so it's a small piece

00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,920
of software that could be operating

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,399
system agnostic and language agnostic

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:54,360
and this operating system can be these

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:58,380
rapper can be easily deploy it in any

00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:02,579
eight erogenous platform so in purples

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:07,019
we are not trying to imagine eyes our 96

00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:08,250
board and farm I mean we want to have

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,810
different boards with different

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,990
capacities and different operating

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:18,440
system and then we try to inject this

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:23,160
little piece of socket so after that

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,470
devices can behave like this X so when

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,560
we talk about a new operating system

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:31,319
approach we should consider the legacy

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,010
so at this moment it's a rocker and

00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:37,860
there is a discussion my team about

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:40,750
embedding that has a a demon inside the

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,780
operating system but that is

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,350
quite relevant to the success of this

00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:50,500
initiative we usually people think about

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,380
languages like Java we decide to do a

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,150
radical shift to modern languages so in

00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:01,060
our case we are using a new language

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:04,560
name is Alexis that facilitates the

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:11,890
semantic representation of this one

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:19,470
thank you for the question and another

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:19,470
question how

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:29,400
oh yeah so that is another problem we

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:31,710
are trying to qualify the 96 ports at

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:39,750
this moment we have a deployment we have

00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:44,640
a solar energy using generator on a park

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,680
nearby we have 4000 panels there so we

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,000
want to have one in Sector panel we

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:54,180
talked about 4,000 volts so we have some

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,060
challenges regarding qualifying the 96

00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,030
boards to this local environment but

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:03,830
that is about sophistication so we are

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:08,910
to be meeting these boards to to whether

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:12,750
to environmental life and then we are

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:16,050
trying to design boxes to keep them more

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:21,480
space but that's also a problem that we

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:24,990
doesn't see too complicated because 96

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,030
board is a step ahead traditional single

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,670
board computers like raspberry PI's and

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:33,630
they are more reliable robust and

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:37,170
somehow they standards prefer this board

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:40,290
for certification for example when you

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:43,140
think about solar you need to consider

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:46,220
the environmental temperature eventually

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:50,850
you can have diverted to higher than 85

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:55,460
degrees Celsius a the ninth export are

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,460
behaving quite well in this scenario

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:13,959
and another question well I will be here

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:16,179
another question yeah oh yeah it's a

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:20,100
free war in this city in the sense that

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:22,780
we are specifying the operating system I

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:38,740
mean we have a lot of thoughts as being

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:41,440
deployed well when you try to put our

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,750
pieces together you need to use all this

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,130
sort of Technology know you use JSON

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:51,790
Hydra everything but it doesn't want to

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:58,660
have a framework in the sense where

00:17:51,790 --> 00:18:02,260
people we need to focus in the computing

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:04,090
model that is this one this framework it

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,250
will be more related when we will

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:09,570
address the semantic part they

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:13,299
artificial intelligence injected in the

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,710
in the insects and that is the key part

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,299
that eventually you need to have a

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:21,130
framework because for every given

00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,049
complex task two people perform it you

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,419
need to have a different programming

00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:28,270
approaches so that is the open part

00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:32,140
everything else will be a kind of piece

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:35,890
of software that inject on on exact and

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,200
then they will behave like swarms for

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:41,620
example discovery services security

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,950
services they are all part of the same

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:48,970
infrastructure nope we doesn't need to

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:55,270
give users programmability openness on

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:57,730
this so most of these things will be

00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:00,669
clearer as soon as we will deploy the

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:03,840
first implementation probably in the

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:03,840
third quarter of the semester

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:21,269
okay hi John oh yeah our Center it is

00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:26,059
really committed with this swarm

00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:29,789
approach and we'll talk about

00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:32,639
collaboration opportunities this swarm

00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:35,429
is the big initiative in berkeley

00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:37,469
announced in preview many companies like

00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:41,309
Qualcomm Google are supporting this

00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:47,849
initiative there and we are looking for

00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:51,179
several dimensions of these the problem

00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:54,719
for example on Friday we will talk about

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:58,529
an open GPU that we're designing the

00:19:54,719 --> 00:20:01,559
GPUs are becoming important part in

00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:04,679
terms of processing of these devices so

00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:08,070
on a given point when you use this form

00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:10,889
approach friendly the ioc's became

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,950
relevant and then you need to look for

00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:15,869
high performance in the edge so when you

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:20,639
talk about high performance in the edge

00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:24,389
you need flock and you need processing

00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:26,759
capacity and we understand that arm is

00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:30,059
doing very well in terms of processing

00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,919
capacity we are we are achieving almost

00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,379
teraflop computing in some of these

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,080
devices but the GPU is the important

00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:41,639
part and GPU consumes a lot of energy

00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:44,369
and if you see insects doesn't consume a

00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:47,609
lot of energy so once out that will give

00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:50,729
them friday is about these functional

00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:54,059
open GPU that were designing and the

00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:57,059
second part is about collaboration we

00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:00,450
have manufacturing facilities we can

00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:04,169
manufacture something like 4,000 insects

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:09,599
per day in fact we are trying to rip out

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:12,269
a program on these I hope that will be

00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,429
here on Friday to foster these

00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:17,479
discussions and I will be here the whole

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:19,620
day in Perkins I have much more

00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:23,309
presentations about the soft part

00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:27,330
but I decide to preserve and avoided but

00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:29,010
you see here that I have our pieces of

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,950
the operating system and have a given

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:34,350
specific presentation I will be very

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:39,990
happy to discuss this more technically

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:41,760
after these stocks could be a little bit

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:47,070
boring and I'll discussing discovery

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:49,559
methods or how to rescale 200,000

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:54,200
devices on a water deployment on a big

00:21:49,559 --> 00:22:12,540
city like são Paulo and another question

00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:17,850
okay yes well that's one plan we want to

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:20,790
have 196 port per panel and my students

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,470
are designing a shield for that so we

00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:26,370
are talking to something like 4,000

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,950
boards and since we can manufacture then

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,650
we can reduce you frequently they cost

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,290
for one third of it so it's quite

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:38,220
interesting we have a lot of problems

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:41,429
including ad hoc cells configurable

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,890
networks you know most of networks

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:47,460
available doesn't support more than 256

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:50,970
devices so we are just designing some

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:55,559
fully distributed networking schemes to

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:59,250
self configure 4000 devices at all

00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:02,120
because that is the beauty of the swarm

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:05,610
you doesn't have a centralized approach

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,790
it's like ants you know you just drop

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:12,390
the end and some time later the end we

00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:14,820
start to build the unformed so we want

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,130
to draw four thousand boards and make

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,330
these boards self configure an organized

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:24,179
itself without human intervention of

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,590
that is why it's a different mindset you

00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,929
know it's a different way to see things

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:31,560
you know where it doesn't have a

00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:34,220
centralized and again bureaucratic

00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,220
approach

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,380
okay so i think my time going thank you

00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,350
very much

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:48,310
[Applause]

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,310
