	"Session ID: BUD17-309
Session Name: IRQ prediction - BUD17-309
Speaker: Daniel Lezcano
Track: Power Management


★ Session Summary ★
The CPUidle is one component of the power management framework. It behaves in an opportunistic way when there is nothing to do on the system, by trying to predict the next CPU wake up and select an idle state.   But the current design has some weaknesses as it mixes the different sources of wakeup, resulting in an already non-deterministic situation getting worse. This presentation will describe the issues faced with the current approach and will show another approach to predict the next wake up event with a better accuracy, leading, under some circumstances, to 100% right predictions.
