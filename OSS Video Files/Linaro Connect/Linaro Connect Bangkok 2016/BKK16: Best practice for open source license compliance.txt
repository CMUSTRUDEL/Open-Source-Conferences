hello I'm under a Gallo we are at linaro

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,240
connect in Bangkok and I'm with two

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,060
friends who I've known for as long as

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,310
six years and it has been a continuous

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,199
learning process for me from from this

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,010
friend so I'm very excited to welcome

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:33,030
Shane Coughlin and Arnold belt and they

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,070
have been our guest at the keynote they

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,320
gave us a very interesting talk about

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,140
the best practices for open source

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,230
license compliance so thank you very

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,570
much for being with us one very

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,329
important message that you shared during

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,360
the keynote is about the ultimate goal

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,350
of the license compliance and license

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,629
enforcement can you tell us more you

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,809
know compliance is never an end in

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,059
itself the thing with free software is

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,979
that it's not about free code it's about

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,770
getting multiples of your engineering

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,290
investment and compliance is one of the

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,920
important parts of that to allow

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,020
companies to strategically get the most

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,900
value from their engagement in this

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,670
community therefore it's pretty clear

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,650
that whenever you approach compliance

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,409
what you're approaching is a way to

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,710
optimize stakeholder engagement in this

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,960
field so the ultimate goal of license

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,210
compliance is to become a member of the

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,329
collaborative development process it is

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,310
not the compliance itself that is the

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,939
ultimate goal and in terms of the

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,259
ultimate goal of enforcement it is

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:48,030
becoming into compliance with the

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:52,770
license and not something that is about

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:55,290
damages or about financial aspects it's

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,229
really about the cease-and-desist claim

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:03,170
about not further distributing a product

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:06,060
that is in compliant we we often get

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,629
requests for help from our members when

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,930
they they need numbers and figures and

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,620
clear figures to justify investing in

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,299
open sore

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,540
and in open source communities from

00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:21,209
their executives at their companies we

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,569
usually try and help them providing

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,870
hints to to those studies and analysis

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,480
about the estimated cost and usually we

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,840
trying to explain that there's an

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,780
estimated cost of development for a

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,239
given point of time for a given software

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,409
project and then there's an additional

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,769
cost over time that is the continuous

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:49,290
maintenance and improvement so there's a

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,930
development costs and maintenance

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,370
upgrade costs incremental costs and

00:02:51,930 --> 00:03:00,599
these provided total cost of ownership

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:03,480
in your keynote you refer to the grab

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:08,819
and run approach versus the invest and

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:13,079
grow approach can you explain better and

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:15,959
how can you help the members understand

00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,700
the financials and the savings when

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,310
joining an open-source community the

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,370
right way now that's a really good

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,519
question when I said invest and grow

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,530
rather than grab and run is the

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,319
important strategic approach to free

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,410
software I meant that when you think

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,690
that free software delivers multiples of

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,410
your engineering investment but it

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,569
provides you with a way to reduce R&D

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,840
costs on complex platforms and

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:49,230
accelerate time-to-market you don't do

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,230
that on one single product one software

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,680
download you engage with Nico system on

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,989
life cycles of product families it's not

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,720
a situation where you go and grab free

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,079
code and leave and get the right value

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,720
you invest in this space and you grow

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,060
the space to grow your platforms and

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,819
that's what provides you with the

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,700
fantasia

00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:18,430
stick returns available Harold can you

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:22,900
share an example of the the best the

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:26,590
gold reference of a process where you

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:29,590
started enforcing allies license and the

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,990
company had the best behavior that that

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,720
you would use as examples a trap for

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,160
example to any other company that needs

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,259
to comply ok so the gold standard for

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,080
license compliance and for getting into

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,880
license compliance after having had some

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,520
issue in terms of license compliance is

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,800
clearly to recognize that there was a

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,800
problem to admit that there is a problem

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,210
and then to thoroughly analyze the

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,710
business processes and and the internal

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,169
behavior that resulted in a lack of

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,169
license compliance in the first case so

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:08,590
sometimes this may need one or two or

00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:10,509
three wake-up calls in terms of having a

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,599
delivered a product into the market

00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:16,120
without license compliance but then if

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,889
you really take this up as a challenge

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,720
and as something that needs to be

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,440
resolved for your business as a good

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:27,520
corporate citizen it is actually not so

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,259
hard to resolve these issues in contrast

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,770
we have seen several other organizations

00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:34,419
and companies that basically do not even

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,789
start to admit there is an issue that

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,699
make up legal arguments for the sake of

00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:41,349
a legal argument that drag on cases for

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,840
a very long time basically making

00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:45,820
excuses and excuses and that's really

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,300
not the kind of behavior that we expect

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:52,320
from companies participating in and

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,840
using a free software and from an

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,610
engineering aspect you mentioned that

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,440
the engineering phase where you are

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,840
studying a product analyzing a product

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,020
and seeing if if your code is in and

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,580
that is the most interesting funny part

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:15,400
from the engineering side can you tell

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,940
us about the most difficult or most

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,730
interesting case the

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,680
have been through well I should probably

00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,390
not mention this here because others

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,310
might follow this example but actually

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,290
the most fun and the most challenging

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,280
technical investigation was with a

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:34,820
specific firewall product vendor who

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,620
encrypted there a firmware image with an

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,390
encryption algorithm and key that was

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,150
stored in the bios so we first had to

00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,980
reverse engineer the encryption system

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,810
in the bios in order to decrypt the

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,500
image in order to prove that actually

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,510
code that i hold copyright is included

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,970
in the product but as said please don't

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,980
do this thank you very much for being

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,960
with us thank you very much for the very

00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:01,030
interesting keynote and I hope you will

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,030
