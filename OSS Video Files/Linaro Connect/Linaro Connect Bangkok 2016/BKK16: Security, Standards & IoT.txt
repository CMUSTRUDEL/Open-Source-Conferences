hello everyone I'm grant lightly linaro

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,269
fellow and I'm here with Matthew Garrett

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,160
a security developer at core OS and

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,340
well-known writer and blogger on

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,020
security topics Matthew welcome to

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,350
linaro connect you've written a lot

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,320
about security issues with firmware why

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,760
is security so difficult to get right

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,279
fermer is an especially interesting

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,890
problem for security because it's the

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,309
fundamental root of trust in the entire

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,160
security policy of a device firmware is

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,950
often very system specific is often

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,500
written from scratch and typically has

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,570
much less review by third parties than

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,600
any other part of the software system so

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,430
as a result of that the firmware is

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,390
frequently the easiest avenue of attack

00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,600
for advanced adversaries what role then

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,539
does free software and standards have in

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,790
building secure systems using free

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,710
software in this space means that we can

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,450
reuse the same code on multiple

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,570
different devices allowing for a great

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,490
deal more review and over time

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,850
significant reduction in the number of

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,770
bugs having specifications be a part of

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,320
this means that we're not just having

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,689
broader review of the code itself but

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,840
also browse a review of the protocols

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,110
and security techniques used within this

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,460
space so by having an adopted standard

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,930
we can potentially have multiple

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,900
implementations of that standard and

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,650
still benefit from having more review

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,020
and gaining additional security overall

00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,030
specifications such as UEFI and the work

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,100
of the trusted computing group mean that

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,790
we have firmware level specifications

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,110
that can actually be brought up to the

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,229
level of the operating system that

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,469
provide runtime benefits we have as a

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,119
result a known security stack that we

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,030
can build on top of and build more

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,130
reliable products overall so UEFI and

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,229
trusted computing group are normally

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,929
associated with PCs and server

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,270
technology are those really relevant

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,680
when we're talking about mobile embedded

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,840
or

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,219
or Internet of Things devices absolutely

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,079
and obviously the innocent things

00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,819
devices are the lowest ends of the scale

00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:23,239
here but the trusted computing group

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:25,640
recently had a half-day session at the

00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,069
RSA conference in San Francisco focusing

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,049
on using trusty confusing to secure

00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:35,840
Internet of Things devices we're seeing

00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:38,359
a lot of desire to push these enterprise

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,340
and consumer level technologies into

00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:42,260
much smaller devices and as these

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,560
devices are more functional this becomes

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,939
a much better fit well thank you very

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,829
much for taking the time to chat with me

00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,939
today and I hope you enjoy your visit to

00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,939
