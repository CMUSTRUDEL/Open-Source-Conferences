hello i'm cara cara technology

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,839
strategist in linara i'm here today with

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,720
eric hmmm hey thur who presented our

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,490
keynote today so you talked about the

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,619
medical use cases in the keynote today

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,350
could you tell us more about that sure

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,420
the the keynote title was about from

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,740
sensors to supercomputing and so we

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,090
talked about a number of different

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,460
application areas of with inter-site

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,050
with medical one we talked about various

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,790
different kinds of sensors and how we

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,649
need to stream a little data from all

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,079
the sensors up into the clouds we can

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,360
analyze it also later in the talk on the

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,100
supercomputing side we talked about new

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,980
emerging applications which are super

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,710
computer problems and how those will

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,600
impact medical and other challenges that

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,059
we face and what would you say are the

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,180
key problems we should focus on in that

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,710
use case so a lot of the well there's

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,020
different problems at different scales

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,030
and so but a lot of these problems are

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,400
turning into how do we handle large

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,170
amounts of streaming data and so we need

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,450
to be able to process it at the end

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,580
nodes aggregated up through the network

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,799
and to get it to the cloud we can once

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,229
large graph streaming type algorithms on

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,299
it and the challenge long term will be

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,369
how do we do this in an end in manner

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,580
such that it's safe and available would

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,049
secure I've had there's project in

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,299
Cambridge University along these lines

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,530
yes I haven't told them yet but there's

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,170
flood got dropped out of the final

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,170
jacked at a time but they did a really

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,650
interesting project so you know they're

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,790
working on the telescope array in

00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,710
Antarctica and it turns out a lot of

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,899
places you want to do the science you

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,340
can't get access to the Internet so what

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,950
do you do you could either rewrite your

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,229
ass or in their case they decided to be

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,549
easier to make the internet portable and

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,790
it's when the first time that I've seen

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,930
internets FAQ on weight because this

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,970
peace and focuses that piece of

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,130
equipment has to go on the boat to can't

00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,470
be too heavy you know pick it up but it

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,460
basically gives your it gives you the

00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,410
ability to connect to the internet

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,260
wherever you are anywhere on the planet

00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,479
and do your science so the same analogy

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,020
can be applied in the medical use case

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,340
yes so you know sub-saharan Africa is

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,400
one place where you can't get a good

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,230
internet connection you know hotel rooms

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,330
all over the place so but but anywhere

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,800
that you know you want to have this

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,720
paradigm where you take the data and

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,820
aggregated it and then push it up to a

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,680
larger cloud you get something to catch

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,480
it and so you do the internet presence

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,920
to using one of these applications and

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,350
so if you don't have it where you are

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,900
when it is crane with you so for anyone

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,130
who wants to get involved in hpc what

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,170
would you say to them it's a really

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,700
exciting time Iran arm in hpc at the

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,070
moment you know with new arm servers

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,959
coming out and various test beds we have

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,120
at all different installations so I

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,860
think you know if you're interested the

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,600
arm research is heavily involved we're

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,310
working with toolchains the math

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,080
libraries and we just like to bite

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,540
everyone to come to the party thank you

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,980
Eric so it's coming to connect and for

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,980
giving us a spectacular keynote

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,010
