we are at bangkok a lovely spring day at

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:47,289
the sunshine about to start another

00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:49,120
connect i'm here with George great so

00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,659
George what are you looking forward to

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,589
this week

00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:54,299
so I think this week is going to be

00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:57,339
great in Bangkok I'm looking forward to

00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:00,549
the fact that we're now involved in

00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:02,409
everything from IOT and sensors all the

00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:04,989
way through to the cloud and the data

00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:08,590
center yeah it's a pretty wide range of

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,590
things so tell me what's interesting to

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,210
you about our new group light so light

00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,190
is group that we're in the process of

00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:19,270
starting up we've had a lot of interest

00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:22,539
from across the industry in IOT and

00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:26,110
alarm particularly the bridge between

00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:29,049
cortex and cortex a all the way up to

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,630
the interaction of that data being

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:34,030
generated and the cloud and arm in the

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,310
data center so looking forward to

00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:39,490
getting those discussions underway with

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,409
both the Asia members and also our our

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,409
existing members from Europe and the US

00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:46,420
yeah you make a good point that the

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,399
Internet of Things is not just about

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,200
little tiny devices that light bulbs

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,609
it's also about getting that data into

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,439
the cloud and processing it

00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:55,390
so that the other end of the problem is

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,159
relevant which is all about all in the

00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,869
data center can you tell us a little bit

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,109
about what's happening around that this

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,590
week yes I think that we've started some

00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:07,929
initiatives around delivering end-to-end

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,109
software so not just a piece of client

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,850
software or a piece of firmware but

00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:15,549
actually using what we're calling the

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,549
reference platforms to deliver a

00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:21,640
complete open source reference

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:23,620
implementation that our members and the

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,269
community can use as a starting point

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,930
for delivering the functionality in the

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,150
value-add

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,359
they want to add and then we're all so

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:34,959
excited this week around some activities

00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:38,200
were going to announce on Monday that

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,719
are applicable to cloud applications in

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,689
the data center so come to the keynote

00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,700
on Monday to watch this space to hear

00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:47,170
about the cloud well that covers both

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,730
ends of the problem that covers the

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,639
sensor and it covers the cloud what's

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,099
happening in between man so I work in

00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,980
mobile digital home and networking

00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:00,310
continues mobile focused on power

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:04,870
management particularly the digital home

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,510
group on media and security in Android

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,719
and the Comcast rdk and we're also

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:15,760
starting work this year on TV OS which

00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:18,790
is the China digital home ecosystem and

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,950
in LNG work on ODP continues and we're

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,450
starting to see deployment of ODP into

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,939
real life applications so that's

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,219
exciting so interesting and busy week

00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:28,239
it's going to be a very busy week but I

00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,659
think it's gonna be a fun one for

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,659
everybody

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,220
