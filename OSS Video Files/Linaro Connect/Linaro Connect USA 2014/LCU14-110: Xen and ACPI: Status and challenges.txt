Description: 
	LCU14-110: Xen and ACPI: Status and challenges

---------------------------------------------------

Speaker: Naresh Bhat, Christoffer Dall
Track: Virtualization
Location: Grand Peninsula B, Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport, Burlingame, CA, United States
---------------------------------------------------

★ Session Summary ★
In this development and hacking session, we will be working out development issues relating to the developing a prototype of running the Xen hypervisor and Dom0 on platforms with only ACPI support.  Supporting Xen on ACPI platforms is particularly challenging, because the Xen hypervisor consumes parts of the ACPI data and accesses a few hardware resources, whereas Dom0 accesses the remaining hardware resources and accesses the rest of the ACPI data, but cannot access all of the hardware.  This session is targeted at developers actively working on ACPI and/or Xen, and we will be discussing current development challenges and specifically validate the feasibility of using the _STA methods to override hardware descriptors consumed or modified by Dom0.

	00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,190
alright everyone let's get started so

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:16,289
Zen an AC I mean ever recurring topic of

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:18,330
discussion in our connect so add a

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,460
picture to make this section very

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,250
interesting so this whole thing about a

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,779
CGI and supporting that on our divers

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,210
arm platforms is a little bit of a

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,590
non-trivial problem right and so just to

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,660
recap Olympic we were there for the

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,189
previous discussions so the whole the

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,739
whole problem is because when you're

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,540
moving Zen which is a small minimal

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,700
hypervisor directly on the hardware and

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,399
you're describing all your hardware in a

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,140
CPI then there are certain things are

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,120
described name LMAO thats then just

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,399
can't read the next can't get to and

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,800
there are also certain things that then

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,410
will consume that dom0 should not be

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,300
looking at and we need some mechanism

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,949
for sent to tell them 0 that you should

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,000
not be looking at these devices or you

00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,520
should be looking at a different version

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,579
of these devices but then can't because

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,010
it's a minimal instance it can't go and

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,460
modify a full a cig I blog recompile

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,170
admitted I blog change that so it's also

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,369
special an arm compared to attend 26

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,780
because there are certain assumptions

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,909
you can't make you can't assume that the

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,490
serial port is just there there or for

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,960
other things like that so that was the

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,960
initial problem we've been trying to

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,000
look at and work quite a way through so

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,909
when I was working on this problem and

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,829
the this work was being tracking car

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,840
1291 and we're trying to update the

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:36,840
fridge you can follow along as we go so

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,430
for human beings where we are is that we

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,610
have descent hypervisor itself who

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,530
digitally on the base model with UEFI

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,500
and we also have with the foundation

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,899
model but that doesn't run unify so that

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,369
runs with forever with a hack but that

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,500
means that memories they'll describe the

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,970
device tree node because the memory

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,450
information is obtained from you if I

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,869
not from a CPI so that's the two basic

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,229
working set object you can play with so

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,580
in Zen itself we have support for kk

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,500
timers view

00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,479
getting the number from the unifi and

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,560
for the UART and that's all based on a

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:19,060
CPI are not into device tree at all so

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:23,380
the this problem of having to hide a

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,510
device in the front dom0 the previous

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,360
approach we were working on last connect

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,280
was this flag list table where basically

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,200
you would create a secondary table that

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,870
you able to add that exceed code and

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,540
just say these items in the a CPI data

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,400
structure are just to be considered gone

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,620
and delete it and you simply remove them

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,270
from the data structure but the point

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,420
was ray is that that will sort of punch

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,500
holes the India's guy data structure

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,120
what that means is that they'll great

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,000
unreachable nodes right so if you have a

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,560
device hanging off another device then

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,030
you won't never be able to get to hear

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,130
those and if your semantics are that

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,459
you'll just want a non initializing pro

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,140
and continuing device the wealth and the

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,510
whole thing breaks down right so instead

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,400
it was suggested that we liver this

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,100
underscore is ta method which is a

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,019
method of exists implicitly in all acpi

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,450
objects if you can call and if that

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:18,480
returns one of these values but if for

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:20,860
example if you return let's see

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,989
president able decoding Shabak you

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,060
should test pc divinity it should be 0

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,100
baby i put the values in correctly but

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,480
in any case then if you're turning out

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,610
here that says the device is disabled

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,290
then the idea is if a CPI itself tries

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,690
to do anything through three mil

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,160
bytecode or if the driver the driver

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,810
should check those values into not

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,390
initialize the device right to the

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,280
device and then have the in linux

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,640
already the states and respects this and

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,130
we get that for free the idea is to hang

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,989
status override tables we have a

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,360
separate table but instead of it saying

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,940
removing a removing a different device

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,590
it tells the next to perform a

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,690
pre-processing step where you go through

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,959
and seven EST a method on those devices

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,700
that you want to overwrite so that that

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,930
sort of maintain series little tree data

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,870
structure while allowing you to still

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,209
disabled sort of devices so that's close

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,870
to the previous approach but but that is

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,730
the current

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,860
so you have a proposal for expect on how

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,590
this should look like the it will work

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,120
with the allottees in the room but we

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,510
work with the ACP a group from from

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,860
laying on reserving that sta Oh table

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,020
name in creating a pointer and saying

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,250
this is this is the spec and making sure

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,500
that we can implement everything based

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,090
on that and then I guess well we have

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,940
time after the figure out who want that

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,380
table to actually be part of the

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,479
official spag work which is when reserve

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,790
the name but at least in any case it

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,080
probably reasonable to work with it and

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,560
see that we have a full working set up

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:49,090
before before trying to include it in

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,150
this bed so in terms of upstream

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,250
hatchery first then I don't think

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,990
anything's been reviewed currently so

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,740
you guys should just fiddle in here if

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,300
I'm wrong it's probably on your big box

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,889
of all it's not it's an apology tree

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,240
obviously but then but I think that's

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,880
sort of one of the next things that we

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,610
should look at it's probably worth a

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,919
little bit of discussion on sort of what

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,330
are you guys as maintainer you guys are

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,610
you ready to take cash for this do you

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,080
want to keep you out of tree for a while

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,539
do you want just see both of those oxys

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,860
what sort of your you want to not seek

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:29,560
you for everything works posted rxt i

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,479
think yes mr. Darcy's it smoothly the

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,240
first study nice we're about two weeks

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:36,190
for the trees n 405 and I think you

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,220
could be feeling on the same by picture

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,190
it's probably so Joe Mixon is normally

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,510
apply the next week okay yeah closing

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,800
party but you guys want to see the

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,330
incrementally and just see patches as

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,190
they grow RC wiser do you want a full

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,460
working solution I don't know it's

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,320
basically up to I think probably better

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,139
to see it sooner rather than later okay

00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:03,580
and if ever been to the from it would

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:05,470
carry often question yep so the rest and

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,500
you should start posting the changes to

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,680
design a tyrant hello today to get big

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,620
file online you guys did we go the other

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,500
than esq

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:20,780
yeah all right okay let me make it as

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:24,050
well okay so we'll start moving about so

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,460
another interesting picture and some

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,090
questions that we sort of just gathered

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,750
all along the way and that helps to them

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,979
but let's verify them in this forum so

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,820
the question was raised whether we need

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:40,729
to act and instant viewed by four pound

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,710
0 I mean after the nazgûl it to be able

00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:45,500
and anxious to put on their own services

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,289
or around a question for example we

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,669
would've actually no I thought the

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,350
conclusion that last night was that you

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,449
with whatever information you to pass

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,169
from z'ha'dum 0 you just use the

00:06:53,449 --> 00:07:00,080
Backstreet that'll be it five string

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:03,039
twice right right are you going to tell

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,330
the are you gonna pass a command lines

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,560
well that's our think yeah yes you have

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,669
at this time little device tree with

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,050
whatever you need to to tell them is

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:14,270
there anything we're done zero would

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,450
need access to food services or runtime

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,610
purposes so runtime services it's an x86

00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:23,240
we have mechanisms are plotting through

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:27,010
vacaville hypervisor for things like it

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,660
would be variable time things like that

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,510
british matter how generic that is over

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,280
the lips oil you could be posted it

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:39,979
doesn't it was it to all others working

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:43,820
to the total upstream to changes then

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:46,400
the odds were pretty cool so not part of

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,060
see no nothing like that I don't have

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,250
been a private so basically this letter

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,800
links the chooses whether to use in a

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,169
conditional for our tech services that

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,130
is now runtime service

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:04,789
agreements or amazed senator Brown

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:07,130
answers okay so I mean I don't know how

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:10,039
much which extend the VM image the

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,539
standard applies for 40 right but that

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,010
specifies for example are to see you

00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,960
would just be the runtime service

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,389
culture performing something about that

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,430
frazetta that works in this context but

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,840
certainly more than you invited to rob

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,750
and moved on zeros

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,280
idea what I don't know if it's bad idea

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:32,089
visible necessary it's not the group

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:42,349
that makes it bad available okay right

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:47,480
oh there is one of the most remind me

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:52,000
which is the reset holes and then

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:56,029
additionally any setting our Paris

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,490
you're going to poke the globe it reboot

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:02,720
e to have an all-time sales calls me

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,390
isostatic not scary right yeah yeah if

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,800
you're not going to Mars a service you

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,330
you 510 sorry I misunderstood the

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,550
question yeah that's because then you'll

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:18,080
be sitting runtime variables for

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,390
something that never happens but you

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,589
want to go back to the ribs of you and

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:27,410
it's all I missing some context is not

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:29,360
my choice makes many of the reasons is a

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,850
manageable debt to let the front and

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,040
services baseline so at that point with

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,000
something better network yeah when you

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,730
gonna realize whatever you want

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,640
whichever way you did yeah okay it would

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,170
cover that one so the other question is

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,480
just sort of bring down what other

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,240
things could be potential another Road

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,459
need to be accessed by by it said that

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:58,040
we think this completely true let's

00:09:49,459 --> 00:10:01,190
music in one and Ingrid's house back I

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,130
missing new table and what is

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:07,580
progressing drop documents and me

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:10,339
written but that's not old yet these are

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:14,060
all static signals no yes so it would be

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:16,580
not information deaths and set up this

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:22,130
as a new table just how to study and

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:25,250
cohesion BCA so I haven't thought of

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,540
very carefully bad either but if you

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,270
have any sort of the images or anything

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,160
you need to load for done 0 that will be

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:36,050
done by your boot order prior to coating

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,339
right right so I can't come up with an

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,259
example of why you want these are

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:41,870
supporting this I'm a professional so

00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:47,779
another one x86 there is some peace at

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:54,649
school in I possible 100 okay I mean to

00:10:47,779 --> 00:11:04,819
do it approaches the pastor yeah its

00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:08,180
importance is danger space uncommon

00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:11,480
agrees Assad regime useful to them so

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:15,050
you can be sent for you maybe yeah so

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,480
severe there is in the x86 DFID there's

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,449
a section or scams for all pcie rods and

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,810
loads PTI bronze as partying invite so

00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:30,139
whatever some pcie support we needed to

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:32,180
to do that I think also an x86 the I

00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,829
other news are keyed off of pci ID

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,319
something that needs to know and after

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:38,319
that pci bus to configure the iron movie

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:53,380
but how do they get the information if

00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:56,120
it's an email so if if it's at six then

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,639
you know the work with these yeah gossip

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,170
and that is described I don't know how

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,230
to describe as you just you just walk

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,360
bad name these are CFG space you gonna

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,790
great piece of us focus it yourself

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,040
without a pc ISIL onyx isn't that really

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,709
the problem of arms that are not going

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,240
to know about pci host bridge yeah 3

00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:23,740
controller is until you've heard

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:28,279
adversity stt not entirely sure that's

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,350
correct so the medieval yoga because the

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,720
seller made me in tables but mostly

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,640
there was a certain stuff where the air

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,640
arms up

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,430
they're cold factors and instead I just

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,850
couldn't advise them I just say the way

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,590
I got out in emojis lips were Noble it

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,130
is workbooks then you've got a place you

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:52,570
don't have a cpr these you don't have to

00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:55,540
run AM L buddy vote in instead you can

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,520
defer that to ya so no I'm so finishing

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,800
an egg situation we compromise of zero

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,280
without backing but i think that doesn't

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,500
find this suitcase I'm saying but the

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,670
time then runs then you've already got

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,830
the colonel in memory you already

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,680
updated our dear Gloria this editor

00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,380
member yet you have everything you need

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,440
to go to the point of running and they

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:26,470
amount so you should feel like I using

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:27,730
such but who knows young yes but so the

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,610
question was whether it is looking for

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,790
the p73 info so there is a very specific

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:36,310
people called m.c.m.g that maybe that's

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,310
our Singapore but that table contains

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:42,010
information on the refrig announced the

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:48,640
signing table anesthetic brunch Club

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:58,750
problem yeah what can even get them is

00:13:48,640 --> 00:14:01,210
nothing MZ ng alright cool so the

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,950
question came up where the this is that

00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,560
is all right method right it only hides

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,270
the device but if you want to say

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,040
describe a new burst of that device

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,410
because if you also tell my own base

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,590
address or something like that that

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:16,570
device is described in the dsdt then

00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,850
that's not going to work alright so I

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,980
took a little bit too en before and I

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,350
think what I realized was that you guys

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,100
are are set on having it's the same in

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,830
my own map and um 0 as an armor right

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,080
yeah which would basically things by how

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,550
much as possible yeah but if we start

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,410
mucking around there's a little bit of

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,060
that area where we have none with

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,939
solutions so we should be clear about

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,269
this the message

00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:44,889
right right but I think I think it's

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:44,889
important to get this is my drug yeah

00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:53,599
yeah this hard ones that any way you

00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:55,159
could do that modify advisor for that

00:14:53,599 --> 00:15:07,579
the dsdt would require you to happen

00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:11,709
inside of it yeah SSgt to the modify

00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:11,709
things but ssgt is somewhat limited

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:28,519
integrins will be able to have books I

00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:31,999
don't get it from that so so there is

00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:35,859
the SSD team which will extend the

00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:40,519
existing names added license with that

00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:42,829
there are ways to go to license my kind

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,019
of taken recompile chances of stuffs

00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:49,309
collection at an entire entire

00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:51,919
interpreter there's some bios boats that

00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:55,309
have done that yep willing to share

00:15:51,919 --> 00:16:00,799
about that and is it is possible so

00:15:55,309 --> 00:16:02,509
again Eddie is as a key aspect we do a

00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,149
bunch of that sort of stuff for HD I

00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:08,479
guess in x86 but yeah you're my advisor

00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:10,609
but from the virtual phone line test

00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:13,999
yeah it's probably understood cinco's

00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:15,139
yeah I she'll just reheat them yeah okay

00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:18,169
so it sounds like we could find a

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,309
solution even if you know paint yep but

00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:25,339
other than that applies an ohio-based

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:26,899
understand they work on that Alexa move

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,539
in my leverages an hour through night

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,399
right change the arc yard cucumber space

00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:33,919
rising River same would apply rent that

00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:38,449
I wish to do that we need a lot of line

00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:40,609
out you just don't go as you know hello

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:41,600
just like injecting I'm going to change

00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:47,720
any antivirus

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:52,009
it's a beaut yeah consented yep okay y

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,509
after that we already found with that so

00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:55,610
then there was dessert in this case that

00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:56,779
we originally talked about this as the

00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,699
way we would do is sort of an

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,970
implementation detail but worth just

00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:05,179
talking over in would we copy the acpi

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,770
blob and modify it at the sdo table

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,049
recalculate checks out whatever is

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:12,650
needed and then passes come 0 will be

00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:14,659
simply system I pathological given by by

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,020
the hardware we've talked about this

00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:19,370
previously as we want to copy it but as

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,230
part of the rest were implementing it

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:25,100
they were asking well you're consuming

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,689
more memory the rear and Adam Ward code

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,990
is there any reason why later on you

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:34,610
need to have an intact copies n of the

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:37,880
original acpi club I don't think you won

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,380
cuz we r ability don't everybody the

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,830
host so then you get a fresh one from

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:47,480
the parts so rights if you've k sexy

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:50,059
doctor you want the doctor so then won't

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,590
go a new our mental calls or anything

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,120
with a CPI you think needs to go read

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:57,890
whatever data it needs it would extract

00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:03,470
the whole time I that's it so transonic

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:06,169
as well yeah I don't you there is be

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,419
very strict rules about scum food who

00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:11,510
does things in different we've got that

00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:14,090
the path tcp applauded for the NL and

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:17,090
there's a doctor period none of the know

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,880
kinda running commentary because they

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,110
move who who owns the context here and

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,640
just as well it's not designed to

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:28,970
support them study tables are designed

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,669
to be their type table 36 modified

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,980
doesn't really make any sense to make

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,440
copies of them and we hit a situation

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,630
where we can copies of them will copy

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,610
that table at when that time comes yeah

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,980
there's no point in doing it now he is

00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:45,169
going yara stadium pd and things to

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,140
happen use up to them doesn't they may

00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:50,320
be together Henry I know if I'm get

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,320
involved

00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:00,149
patents not to play a Bay Area yeah

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,610
there's some address pointers in there

00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:09,630
and just have to go back and tag it as

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:11,100
though it was about a difficult in just

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,870
fine finding the right arguments

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,370
recommending in the correct way but the

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,639
fact that that could be wrong I actually

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:33,600
tells us to me to comment when I me

00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:36,179
completely um that's it that's all we

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,669
had any other questions any other input

00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:46,980
any other things we want to talk through

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:51,029
yep yes a solution basic question if the

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:54,330
goal of status of Mariah pickles is for

00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:57,570
sale and commuting from down zero

00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:01,590
without deputy Arce is eating me then by

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:04,500
definition it means that you need so bad

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,500
for specific odor and said hi the device

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,659
as you want to hide because you cannot

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,100
go to a genetic way that just are céline

00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:19,139
decide they're just kinda don't not in

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:21,929
I'm soon so I think the thing is we're

00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:24,029
going to hide things where they're in

00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:27,769
the area in the FTT but they are

00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:30,179
referenced from static tables by there

00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:36,029
so we know the time to we need to know

00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:38,250
Italy to write as think little bit the

00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:42,029
best example is e you wanna so these are

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:44,820
the funnest of cable and is also the PSD

00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:52,039
and my private because every user

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:55,769
identity it's that you provide the same

00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,679
so you can do you know they're you know

00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:07,980
that right

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:20,299
easy I ok anything else questions birds

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:23,850
concerns suggestions so CBI more

00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:26,940
empowerment should be yes door agreed it

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:32,070
was a CI CI is already a legitimate so

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:34,500
fast for the exam so the Vice model

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:40,380
management1 the vice of the new in aid

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:52,740
of schemes as ice GI fine that's a power

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:56,789
management for the ministry you asked

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,440
the question here so again you go back

00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:01,380
to it is i'm a pc i have a problem

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:07,500
because all the exam include device

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:13,559
management in our genome 0 and it was a

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:16,860
massacre he don't know many of us having

00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:19,500
to power management on devices

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,980
Thursday's a platform level our

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:28,110
management methanol and striking

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:35,159
recently I so yeah first of all is it

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:41,730
you know our heads for next week I mean

00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:45,659
so yeah we're going to do it look what I

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:48,600
like what they did very very late in

00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:55,169
devices there are levels of management

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:59,150
and rican used to be pc power on 50

00:22:55,169 --> 00:23:03,260
right right right above it so the whole

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:08,650
acpi defines entire is quite an

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:10,420
elaborate stinky of the ECP ica does

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:14,580
takes things one thing the state of the

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:17,830
of the entire system and all that the

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,070
state machine runs within the context of

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,710
the end of term and then it goes and

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,530
touches very specific things so it will

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,690
do the system it'll will do system

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,240
parameters to spend the entire system do

00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,030
run time yeah so it's not just at a CPS

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,000
devices devices are part of this big

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:40,480
state machine that includes power

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,610
suspending the entire system so the

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,190
problem for them and i think is what

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:48,130
you're getting at is the fact that DOM 0

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,890
logo bond up i'm ready to power off and

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,710
says i have no wings got stuff going on

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,330
here please done for me off i think the

00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:00,490
only way that we can handle that is

00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:03,940
there has to be a system state and a

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:10,170
device state handle or a communication

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:13,840
between the Zen journal and Tommy where

00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:15,420
Tom 0 we don't have that one sensei tom

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,920
has some amazing chosen unrelated

00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,290
eventually oh so test is anyone out now

00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,060
he's not yeah that's what have to do

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,150
since then it is it basically has to

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,070
have the building hold off transitioning

00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,540
to a power state they see that I didn't

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:33,220
have all these different levels of the

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:34,870
knees so diseases XD Socrates kind of

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,070
problem and I think they're not very

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:41,080
common because the decision just alone

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:43,570
but yeah we can do it another device

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,910
that will give you as many cars have you

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:49,870
thought fashion down and this might

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:52,990
would you bring that gene level of

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:55,990
saying the entire system let's just slow

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,360
it down a bit or less power saving us to

00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:01,300
keep running this usually done a

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:11,070
security right now that is not singing

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:13,049
at the board level nine button and see

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,879
Stacey right breast

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,950
they're also states references

00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:19,499
specifically it's also the state's

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:23,249
proceed be useless correctly yeah nobody

00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:25,440
everybody has it I mean that is what are

00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:26,999
called again right there was the closest

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,940
they have is that you have a model for

00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:31,889
suspend hibernate and on and off right

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,330
and there are methods that you can find

00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:37,679
and say okay go on a walk put asleep

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,720
five different levels of canyon but

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,379
they're so if you're already doing that

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,570
on x86 basically the same acpi method

00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:47,999
calls those incurred they do something

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,529
compare different but yes that's going

00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:54,330
to have to be coordinated somehow

00:25:49,529 --> 00:26:11,960
between 0 0 night reliance attorney yeah

00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:16,830
I we just seem a little is going to I

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:21,679
think what does so for the for the other

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:26,070
dogs what's facility does the curl user

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:29,759
community that is that on what is its

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:31,859
performance super I'm sorry Ian CIA as

00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,779
far as we love it so just holla at least

00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:37,739
people such as well directed a

00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:39,989
developmental the suite four cpus you've

00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:44,549
got the mechanism up maybe deceive you i

00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:46,799
don't guys so there is a dependent ism

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:50,549
right now for saying and you fast you

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,820
know ok so there's so that's something

00:26:50,549 --> 00:27:06,210
nobody ministry as you do but the quotes

00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:08,340
level will say this domain yeah what are

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,989
the other the trust for mistakes but i'm

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,629
not happy with that means you are not

00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:15,210
talking about you've got a bunch of

00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:18,809
guests and each those guests need a

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:21,950
mechanism to communicate what powerpoint

00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:25,080
it or what what what might that be

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:26,519
and send these two fortigate that were

00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,090
at least feed that information into

00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:33,299
donne 0 or having a natural-looking cpu

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,009
feet working well once obviously a lie

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,559
so that that general doesn't work very

00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:41,100
well in vm settings yeah yeah so Liam

00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:43,230
sent to I mean by then you do the

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,519
remaining idea hope so sue this list but

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,289
that's that's one of the things that we

00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,450
at least have an advanced form and if

00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,919
the answer is we don't we don't fill

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,840
with that it is so the way it doesn't

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,379
think psionics in six and at least is

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,409
good don't serve at seven between so

00:27:54,379 --> 00:28:02,309
we'll do CD freedom see games for being

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:07,740
a baseball park so I think it's time we

00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:10,980
tell us the beginning implemented by 39

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,860
so there's other anything what's in

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:17,309
normal entities construction linux and

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:20,909
just have sander linux to see you fret

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:27,210
that actually as some serious

00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:30,659
limitations it starts in like a person's

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:35,519
heart that he breaks down by Randy

00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:37,980
they're beautiful so later on top of

00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,220
years later they grip them a little bit

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,619
in that so now it's intermittent now in

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:47,429
that providing same exact amount of the

00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:50,100
cake for complete pragmatism so it does

00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:55,320
the tropes is called some governor with

00:28:50,100 --> 00:29:00,919
instead generally no systems by me play

00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:04,080
the others are not that many drivers

00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:07,950
yeah why don't our might be a different

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,759
man but look at the scars on armies

00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:16,019
crisis which are all missing it will

00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:20,509
filter yeah i mean if i remember

00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:24,269
correctly on health cp3 cops travel dept

00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:26,759
things whereas arm we're going to be

00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:29,580
using these veterans private because

00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:33,240
there is just that fast it's coming

00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:43,830
through something another one German

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:46,650
uh so okay we need to close this you can

00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:49,020
mess up on tanked this year the other

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,670
said us communicate through to the Dom

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,450
syrup and I need to go through the one

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:56,910
to it if you do it in Zen it means you

00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:02,640
have to pull the entire par mental state

00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:03,930
machine up into them and it only one so

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,530
the other doesn't one of the points

00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,970
those needs to investigate the other is

00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:12,320
communicating communicating front end of

00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:15,630
our mansion information yes for devices

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,760
right and then the third was the system

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:21,180
state and each one of those needs of

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,150
mechanism of instead of doing PCP

00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,100
retirement rent-a-car manage or embedded

00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,110
in the driver built-in in front of our

00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,770
management because you don't have all

00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:36,680
the knowledge of that it would be to you

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:43,590
probably a sin fronteras man whistling

00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:46,380
so be honest if I regular we having to

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:51,840
tell any real devices custard yeah so

00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:53,670
that is the simple cake and a beautician

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,530
with the device at physical devices onto

00:30:53,670 --> 00:31:00,720
it it is not matter because usually you

00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,030
don't want to allow a big machine and

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,580
I'm free bit of information in here like

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,710
in your regular guests don't want to

00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,870
allow it into the power management on

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,850
the device right so I so ladies with a

00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,680
lot of this mystery originally the

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:18,270
remember probably into a tremendous

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:20,550
opportunity of allowing the spm to our

00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:23,309
manage the device it was never to

00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:26,190
Normandy all touching HP division

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:34,889
here you can write can within is not

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:42,210
little bits using it right yeah so its

00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:44,730
blessing evolving so there are many

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,230
other questions that's it if anybody

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,059
wants to come and take a look at stop

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,889
actually moving and looking at stuff

00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,909
make a fist go find the rash in the

00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:52,649
