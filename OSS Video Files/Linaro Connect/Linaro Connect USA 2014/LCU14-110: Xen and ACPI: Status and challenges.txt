	LCU14-110: Xen and ACPI: Status and challenges

---------------------------------------------------

Speaker: Naresh Bhat, Christoffer Dall
Track: Virtualization
Location: Grand Peninsula B, Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport, Burlingame, CA, United States
---------------------------------------------------

★ Session Summary ★
In this development and hacking session, we will be working out development issues relating to the developing a prototype of running the Xen hypervisor and Dom0 on platforms with only ACPI support.  Supporting Xen on ACPI platforms is particularly challenging, because the Xen hypervisor consumes parts of the ACPI data and accesses a few hardware resources, whereas Dom0 accesses the remaining hardware resources and accesses the rest of the ACPI data, but cannot access all of the hardware.  This session is targeted at developers actively working on ACPI and/or Xen, and we will be discussing current development challenges and specifically validate the feasibility of using the _STA methods to override hardware descriptors consumed or modified by Dom0.
