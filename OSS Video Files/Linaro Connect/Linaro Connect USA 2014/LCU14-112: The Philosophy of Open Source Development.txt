	00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:09,020
I guess we should still there cozy five

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:16,470
minutes okay I guess we should start

00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:19,500
thank you for attending so talk a bit

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,789
about what free software is an open

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,449
source what's the difference between

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,460
free software an open source and and

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,050
especially for those of you who may have

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,419
come from more commercial environment

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:36,690
and wondering exactly how this works

00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:38,880
we'll try and give you a flavor of of

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,090
what it is how well what is the

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,740
community so there's three of us here

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,930
we'll split this talk into it into three

00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,840
parts so I'll talk first a bit about

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:55,010
some of the core concepts and licensing

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,010
and then our life will do their bits

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:03,530
that's true yes so there's a more

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,570
practical session later on today yes so

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,950
which is actually about kind of sending

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,780
in patches and the mechanisms of getting

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,450
work done this is very much about the

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,069
philosophy and the core concepts so the

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,670
fundamental thing here about open source

00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:29,100
is the Four Freedoms the ability to run

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:34,799
copy modify and share your work and the

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,829
software so there's a problem of

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,819
terminology which you come across a lot

00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:41,700
people generally around here talk about

00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:45,090
open source and people also talk about

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,639
free software and Libra software they're

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,219
all basically the same thing floss is

00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:52,679
the term that used to be used a lot to

00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,869
cover this whole sphere of activities

00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,880
without picking any particular term but

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,229
it's fallen out of use a bit and mostly

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,069
you hear about open source these days

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,020
and but it's actually the different

00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,929
names are actually it's the same stuff

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,340
but it's different ways of looking at it

00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,170
so there's there's the development model

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,000
which is kind of what the open-source

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,830
people focus on and there's the

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,030
philosophical movement about

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,220
which drives that which is what the free

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,960
software people are primarily interested

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,640
in um so sometimes seems a little

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,070
inefficient you often get several

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,090
projects doing exactly the same thing

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,610
but you have to think of it like an

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,590
ecosystem biological system the most

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,000
effective projects for whatever reason

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,210
it might be that their marketing was

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,710
better rather than their software but

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,300
whichever things successful is the thing

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:46,800
and everyone ends up using and although

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,260
that can often seem inefficient during

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
the making it's actually the most

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,580
effective way of getting stuff done in

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:59,430
the long term so open source is really

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,200
about the fact that the source is

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,580
available that's the fundamental concept

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,400
as a developer you can just get the

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,690
software change stuff and get your work

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,209
done the official definition is that the

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,150
Open Source Initiative okayed the

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,880
licenses under as an open source license

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,310
there are 52 of them last time I looked

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,450
we try not to add a new licenses anymore

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,680
these days there was a period when

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,600
people met new license every five

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,550
minutes Jenrry there are now enough

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,840
licenses in the world and if you feel

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,459
you need a new license you're probably

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,500
wrong and should go and look at which

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,440
one of the ones that currently exist is

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,970
most appropriate and if your lawyers

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:43,110
tell you needed license tell them

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:45,300
they're wrong too so there are things

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,690
which call themselves open source that

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,400
aren't really shared source is a thing

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,690
Microsoft invented which means you can

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
look at the source but you can't change

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,610
any of it or build the stuff any we can

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,860
do that so that is not open source and

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,780
nor is it free software and there's also

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,459
sometimes you get open core projects

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,920
which is they make some of it available

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:09,660
as free software but not all of it and

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,790
the part that's available is indeed open

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,010
source from free software but the bit

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,560
you haven't got isn't and that's how

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,359
they try and keep control despite being

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,370
whilst also being able to claim to be an

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,540
open source project those people are

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,540
generally annoying and best avoided

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,280
because they haven't really

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,810
stood that the important thing is making

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,480
the code available and changeable for

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,530
everybody on an equal basis and as long

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,380
as they're trying to keep control

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,450
they're doing it wrong and that applies

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,530
to you out there and your company's you

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,820
know there's often a proprietary piece

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,710
at the top but trying to keep control of

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,730
half of a software project is generally

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,320
a bad plan so open source has spread

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,790
these days you get people talking about

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,090
open source hardware and open-source

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,520
buildings which is just the same concept

00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,930
making the designs available in a way

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,810
that people can change and use for

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,340
whatever their purposes are and I guess

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,860
I guess an important point sometimes

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,420
people think that if the software is

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,340
just out there for anybody to use that

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,360
means it must be public domain and that

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,290
is not true copyright always exists

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,940
automatically fundamenta have to do

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,820
anything to have copyright and some code

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,320
it just exists it's actually more less

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,790
impossible to put things properly into

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,540
the public domain in many countries is

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:28,580
Joe there is often no such thing and

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:34,700
certainly it has to be a very explicit

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,050
action so as I kind of alluded there's

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,090
there's the open-source people in the

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,130
free software people they're focusing

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,130
different aspects of this model but the

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,750
software is all the same all open source

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,610
software is free software and all free

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,280
software is open source software almost

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,640
there are actually very small obscure

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,340
exceptions which lawyers enjoy to to

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,010
fret about so for example the GPL v2

00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,530
allows you to specify that if a patent

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,360
applies in some country then you can put

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,250
a geographical exclusion and say this is

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,690
available in the GPL v2 everywhere

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,440
except America because its patented

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,180
there and that is actually committed and

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,670
that would in fact be stuff that was

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,540
free software but not open source but

00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,770
you really don't need to worry about

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,870
that stuff to all intensive purposes

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:23,450
it's the same thing there are basically

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,910
two classes of licenses permissive ones

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,850
and copyleft ones so the permissive

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,530
license is pretty much say this is

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,990
software you can share modify and

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:37,660
distribute and we don't care what you do

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,660
with it copyleft license is

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,440
reciprocal saying you can share this

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,940
change it do you like with it but you

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,590
need to give us back the changes so that

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,039
anybody who follows you has the same

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:54,289
rights as you had that's the fundamental

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:57,410
concept so permissive license software

00:06:54,289 --> 00:07:00,199
is the bsd is the canonical license

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:04,789
though these days expat is often

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:08,479
preferred as the canonical example of a

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:09,919
simple committee of license the

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,349
advantages they're very short they don't

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,720
say much basically you can you can do

00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:17,300
you like with this stuff and companies

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,750
like them because you don't have to

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,699
decide at the beginning what's going to

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,440
happen to this software under a

00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,259
permissive license is relatively easy to

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,660
incorporate it in a commercial project

00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:35,479
and keep those changes to yourself and

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:37,490
never give them back and so that appeals

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,139
because often a company is not quite

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,580
sure whether they want to make this into

00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,990
a free software project or it's just

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,889
some code they wanted to do something

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:49,430
with permissive license software can be

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,900
used in copyleft in software and but

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,599
often usually not the other way around

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:57,949
so if you've got some PSD code you can

00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:02,110
mix it into your GPL project but you

00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:07,849
can't generally use GPL software in bsd

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:09,259
projects so yes the copyleft as I say

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:11,479
the fundamental concept is one of

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,979
reciprocity I give you the all the

00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,509
software free you need to give me your

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,190
changes back to so that we're on equal

00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:18,770
footing I'm not giving you all this work

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,330
I did just so that you can go and do

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,690
something with it and keep the changes

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,539
to yourself that's the thing that makes

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,199
it really cool everybody is obliged to

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,340
cooperate on a more or less equal basis

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,190
and that turns out to be a very powerful

00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,940
concept you know this was invented mar

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:40,370
25 years ago no 30 i don't know and a

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,270
while and has slowly taken over the

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:47,510
world pretty much there's a lot of GPL

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,730
software out there and there are the

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,600
licenses in the GPL that's the canonical

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,650
copyleft license

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,440
unless you're a lawyer you don't care

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,670
much about the difference I guess we

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,620
have a slide in here somewhere about

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,910
that in general if you've written some

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,160
code and you're not quite sure what

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,140
license to put on it you know there's a

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,640
choice of about three but you're

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:13,310
probably interested in GPL apache or

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,930
expat / bsd you rarely need to pick one

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:20,089
of the more exotic ones there are

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:22,610
reasons but you get an echo system

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,810
within each license so if code has the

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,190
same license and some of the code you

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,150
can always mix it together and you don't

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,100
have to worry about any of the details

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,870
as soon as things have different

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,800
licenses you need to check hat to what

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:37,670
degree they're compatible and that can

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:42,500
get sticky in a few cases anything I

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:47,029
should have sent you so yes the the GPL

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:49,460
is not as popular as BSD copyleft is not

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:51,710
as popular with companies as the

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:55,450
permissive Lee license stuff because

00:09:51,710 --> 00:10:00,190
once you've decided to make it say GPL

00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:03,110
and yet that code is out there forever

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,150
you can't take it in house and decide to

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,580
keep it for yourself later you can do

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,350
that with a future version to be fair if

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,150
you retain to the right you know the

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,160
part you wrote you can later decide to

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,380
relicense or something else but anybody

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,760
else's contributions stay out there

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,180
forever and so does the last version you

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:24,140
shipped under that licence one thing to

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,660
bear in mind is that the the

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,400
requirements of the GPL only come into

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,140
effect when you've distributed the code

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,300
you can take some software off the net

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,060
fiddle with it test it mix it with your

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,820
own code do you like and there are no

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,380
obligations on you to do anything until

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,400
you actually distribute it outside the

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,170
organization intentionally so that means

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,660
you don't need to worry about oh I

00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,029
touched some GPL code and now I'm

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,959
infected and I have to give away all our

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:56,300
company's software how embarrassing that

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,800
simply is not a risk and people

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,089
increasingly understand there used to be

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,310
something people got very worried about

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,240
so which is whether the viral thing

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,620
comes in you

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,630
have heard people talk about GPL

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,580
software as being viral in that soon as

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:15,770
you mix it with another BF codes all got

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:18,500
the same GPL license and to a degree

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:21,230
that's true if you write code based on

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,589
GPL code that is deemed to be derived

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:27,830
and it's the fundamental its copyright

00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:30,260
law that determines how this works so if

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:34,250
something is thought to be a derived

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:36,290
piece of code from that you wrote by a

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,450
copyright court then that's the

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:43,149
definition of whether this lesson

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,149
supplies or not and to how much the code

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,110
so yes nobody complains about the fact

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,520
that they got an awful lot very good

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,800
software from no money whilst also

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,390
complaining that it's viral so you know

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,620
you don't get your coding effective

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,589
unless you happen to use a load of this

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,930
this nice available software yeah the

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:01,490
reason open-source development is

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,750
efficient is because there's an enormous

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,250
amount of very good software out there

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:09,380
you can just use usually at no cost or

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:14,839
the market little effort and it's very

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:18,290
malleable so if you have copy left at

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,420
software and you when you distribute

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,459
binaries you need to also distribute

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,310
source or at least an offer of source

00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:26,720
it's much easier to just give people the

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,890
sauce with the binaries make them both

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,550
available together then your your

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:36,350
requirements are met and you don't have

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,640
anything else to do if you choose not to

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,860
ship the source automatically with the

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,290
binaries then you need to keep it

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,000
available for three years so for example

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,950
having it in a version control system is

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,510
the modern way of doing things and keep

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,980
the server up so it does require a

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,600
little bit of version management if you

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,770
distribute a lot of versions of stuff

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,079
you need to keep all those versions

00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:01,459
available for three years which is why

00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:07,360
it's easier to just sit them together I

00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:07,360
talked about derivation

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:16,920
and mixing so yeah there are cases where

00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:21,839
mixing different licenses is confusing

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:25,180
so for example the GPL and the openssl

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,610
licenses are not strictly speaking

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,189
compatible most people choose not to

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,379
taken notice of this and write GPL

00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:37,000
software that uses the openssl libraries

00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:39,329
like cups and then ship it mmm strictly

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,259
speaking that's not allowed or at least

00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,779
some lawyers will argue that is not

00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:47,139
allowed and conservative distributions

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:49,480
full of developers like to think they're

00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:51,819
lawyers choose not to ship it that way

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,879
so Debian is quite conservative on some

00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:58,149
of these points and avoids GPL plus

00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,860
openssl ultimately it would have to come

00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:01,810
down to a court case just like whether

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,040
this was a real problem and if nobody's

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,069
ever going to see you about it then

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,360
maybe it doesn't matter but like I say

00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:09,850
from your point of view as a developer

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,199
the licenses are the same it's very easy

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,029
you don't have to worry about it if

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,470
they're different it's worth being aware

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:21,250
that there are cases of similar licenses

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,759
that are not arguably compatible under

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,069
some circumstances there is a thing

00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,790
called the freedom task force which is a

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:34,750
mailing list run by the European Free

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,949
Software Foundation and you can send

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,610
your questions in there if you're not

00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:42,430
quite sure where to ask within the

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,079
narrow ask people like us we'll get to

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,610
some of the resources at the end about

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,290
where to ask dumb questions if you're

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,740
not quite sure whether something is a

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,769
good idea or not um I think this is your

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,769
business

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:09,320
so one of the things that one of the

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,270
things I spent several years at HP doing

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,010
was trying to teach HP about open source

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:17,990
and how it actually works in the world

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:19,340
and this this one question which week

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,650
will it be upstream was one of the

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,720
questions it occurred repeatedly this is

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,150
not like proprietary development in any

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,980
way shape or form you don't get to

00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,900
control the schedules you don't get to

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,140
control the roadmap you are a

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,670
contributor just like everybody else and

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,860
between all of the people that are

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,140
collaborating on the project you will

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,110
decide when things ship what gets

00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,780
included next why it gets included or

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,550
why it doesn't get included but that's

00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,740
always really hard to explain to your

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,630
management because your management is

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,670
looking at it from the standpoint of I

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,520
need to ship a product by the end of

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,680
this quarter and they want you to commit

00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,010
to getting a certain release out in open

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,810
source they get tired of me kind of

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,180
laughing at them about that because

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,790
there's really nothing you can't drive

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,270
that it is a community-driven event when

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:14,080
something releases what it contains is

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:17,140
completely the decision of the community

00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,880
the other thing that that the management

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,220
the management seldom understands is

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,200
that this is not just a short term

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,270
commitment one of the things that you

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,330
can do to drive people crazy in

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:32,660
communities is to do some drive by

00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:35,270
coding where you come in you drop in a

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:41,990
patch or two and and change a major

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:44,270
subsystem and then disappear okay this

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,790
is one of the things that gets sort of

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,290
vetted when people are trying to submit

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,840
patches upstream and trying to get

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,030
changes made is will you be around for a

00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:58,700
while because this code is going to live

00:16:53,030 --> 00:17:00,320
for years decades even if you're just

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,500
going to show up drop in a couple

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,410
patches and disappear it's not going to

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,300
be well taken but that may be what your

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,980
management wants you to do they may say

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,520
okay you're assigned to this project for

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,709
the next

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,260
months 18 months two years whatever it

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,060
might be and then move you off to

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,610
something else but that that commitment

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,670
that you have made by submitting the

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:25,310
patch and getting something upstream

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:28,310
still is there it's not something to do

00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:30,830
what grade goes away and should you ever

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,650
violate that commitment bad things will

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:46,060
happen um people will not talk to you

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:48,290
for a long time yeah so the second is

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,420
you can't tell other people what to do

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,000
right so how how is the work being you

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,220
know distributed you know you know you

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,050
know what you what to do and if you do

00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,630
have dependency let's say your work

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:07,640
depends on some body s work so how does

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:10,030
that get resolved or coordinated I'm

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,130
trying to remember who had the quote but

00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:16,750
one of the quotes that comes to mind is

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:19,340
democracy is a very messy process and

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,490
open source is exactly the same sort of

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,760
thing it's a meritocracy so you can as

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,380
you gain merit in the community you

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,230
could have a more direct influence on

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,290
when things happen and what what is

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:36,020
concluded what is not concluded but at

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,790
all times you're just influencing so

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,600
even if you have a dependency someplace

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:43,640
else the only thing you can really do is

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,790
influence that dependency okay I really

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,190
need this to happen in this project okay

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,470
that's fine that's wonderful that may

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,810
mean that you cannot actually submit

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,300
patches for something else until that

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,700
shows up okay but that's not a

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,160
dependency you can control you can

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:05,090
influence it in if you really want to

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,890
influence it you write them a note say

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,840
can I give you some of my time and

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,440
energy to help you with that project

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,990
that's really all you can do

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,660
unfortunately company schedules do not

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,770
really work that way right they they say

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,200
okay we'll just take care of the

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,360
dependency and move on with your project

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,260
no again all you can do is influence and

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,310
suggest

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:32,150
offer help and collaborate but you don't

00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,710
get to decide so okay you do i'm not

00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,000
sure like on the fourth right you

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,780
haven't you will manage you what does

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,370
that refer to i understand that you like

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,890
neon already you do have project

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,660
managers right what's the role of the

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,890
project marriage is not coordinating i

00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,450
mean i'm still working at you know

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,910
company right so that's kind of project

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,440
managers supposed are you you know so

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,810
maybe this is different walking tiff in

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,600
a way if you could explain in how that

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,250
works so this is my experience has been

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,830
that it's mostly setting the direction

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:06,710
and the and the tone of the effort right

00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,120
so that what the manager is doing is

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,070
saying okay here's here's the goal we

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,900
want to reach here's maybe some

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,940
intermediate goals we want to reach and

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,330
what can we do to eliminate obstacles

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,500
for that to happen but again that's

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:23,960
really all you can do right so deluding

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,120
yourself that you can go in and say it's

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,270
going to happen on november first is

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,220
it's just it's delusional great but the

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,350
other aspect is also like a project

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,710
manager can make sure that you do what's

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:38,450
being asked to do and not you know solve

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,640
all the problems in the world at the

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,080
same time so it's kind of both of those

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,870
and at the same time trying to keep

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,270
track of when do we think this could be

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,070
upstream and and that's the thing you

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,200
have to you know you're still aiming for

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,230
it you know i really want this patch to

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,510
go into colonel 319 i'm aiming for this

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,730
to go into colonel 319 didn't go in

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:01,610
didn't go into 320 I've didn't go into

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:05,720
20 to 25 whatever at some point

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:07,280
hopefully it goes in and one of the

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,660
things I've seen too is it good managers

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,580
are actually following the upstream

00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,620
discussion in one of those in cases like

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,060
that and they can actually kind of see

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,880
what's going on and they can pay

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:20,990
attention to that and and adapt as

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,150
necessary right the edge of the

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,770
questions right so could ask another

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,050
question maybe I'm not sure it's just

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,900
stupid quest United steer caramel mr.

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,790
mindset is staring in a traditional kind

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,480
of company where you know how do you

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:38,119
let's say you work how is their kind of

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,949
evaluation where how it has particularly

00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:41,869
go to work square I mean I can turn the

00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:43,819
performance anything like that if he did

00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:46,639
something like that you know how is how

00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:49,849
these are the cult quality things like

00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:52,099
that anyone is it's a yeah that's that's

00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:54,169
it that's a really tricky thing I mean

00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:56,239
if I know if companies where they

00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:58,699
actually run filters and things on on

00:21:56,239 --> 00:22:00,319
people's software and say okay here's

00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:02,749
you know here's your raise this year

00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:07,849
because our quality metric came to this

00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:12,259
value right that's going to fail

00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:14,389
miserably um 441 primary reason is when

00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,829
is that every community has slightly

00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:19,009
different standards for what constitutes

00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:21,639
would good quality some of them are very

00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:25,819
strict some of them are not so strict

00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:27,319
all depends and a lot of the lot of

00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:30,109
those tools are actually even dependent

00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,059
upon various styles of coding every

00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:35,179
projects probably got its own slightly

00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:38,089
different style so using those sorts of

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,709
strict metrics is really really very

00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:42,079
dangerous thing which what you really

00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:44,119
want to look for more is are the

00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,849
contributions being accepted is the

00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:50,539
discussion actually a a fruitful

00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:51,769
discussion and instead of instead

00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,389
they're just being people on the mailing

00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:55,759
list throwing rocks at each other right

00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:57,789
because you can do that all you want but

00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,349
if there's a discussion happening and

00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:02,239
there is awareness that this person is

00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:04,359
actually trying to contribute and trying

00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:07,129
to contribute well that's a much better

00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:08,869
metric for evaluating things like that

00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:10,939
but one advantage you have is that

00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:12,769
everybody can see everybody's code so

00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:14,149
it's actually easy from a developer's

00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:15,949
point of view you know you're not just

00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:17,209
working behind closed doors somewhere no

00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:19,189
never sees what you did because it never

00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:20,359
project never soars like today you know

00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,459
your stuffs out there it's all in the

00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,989
internet it's on mailing lists so people

00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:27,379
can tell whether you are in fact an

00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:31,189
idiot or not and I'm going to remote

00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:33,349
that so yeah it can be a problem you can

00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:34,699
appear within this particular project

00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,899
that you'll not do very well because you

00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:38,389
didn't get all these patches in quickly

00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:40,069
because upstream said no but you know

00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:42,409
your code is out there and if in fact it

00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:44,839
was good then you know it's not your

00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:49,880
fault so it kind of works both ways

00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:53,070
there's pros and cons open Donovan yeah

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,230
okay so the other other phenomena

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:58,860
that'll happen in open-source

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,780
development is the notion of a fork and

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,790
this has happened repeatedly and will

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,600
probably continue to happen until people

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:09,420
stop being people probably the primary

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:14,040
example is GCC itself actually went

00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:17,280
through a fork many years ago and the

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,950
primary problem was this this subset of

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,559
developers didn't really agree with that

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,059
subset of developers on on the direction

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,240
of the project and where it should go

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:29,700
and how it should behave so they decided

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,059
well the best thing to do is let's let

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:36,030
just part ways so GCC continued on its

00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:41,130
merry way and a project called the e GCS

00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:42,540
started up a copy of the code and

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,390
started making changes the way they

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:48,870
wanted to make changes over time as it

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:51,450
turns out EG CS became more successful

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:54,630
in the sense that more people were using

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,280
it and it was a more reliable compiler

00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,650
and it seemed to be a little more stable

00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,080
than the other one and eventually after

00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,059
a while people came back together and

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,290
said oh well let's look at all the

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,360
interesting things that you guys have

00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,830
learned while you were working i ee GCS

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,980
let's let's start incorporating those

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:13,380
back into GCC and then things started

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,799
getting pulled back together but this is

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,080
a very common phenomenon this it will

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,549
happen you have communities of people

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,980
there will be disagreements in the

00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:25,020
community depending on the strength of

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,230
those disagreements the the community

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:32,910
will divide into factions or not right

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:36,000
so this will happen but it can also do

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:38,610
some very amazing things EG CS itself

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,720
eventually ended up replacing GCC as a

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:45,270
much more robust set of compilers and

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:49,650
we're still using him today and this was

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:52,110
was it 87 or was that earlier license is

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,490
raising the mix is possible you know

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,440
because it's open source you can always

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,059
just go off take it away and do your own

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,649
thing even if the other

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,960
then degree and if it turns out you're

00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:02,850
right and you will actually become

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,110
nearly equal like I say it it's an

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,610
ecosystem with the survival of the

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,480
fittest and this was a very good example

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:13,710
of that we've met in browsers okay and

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,860
just as further examples xfree86 cup got

00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:21,059
formed because well x86 was just being

00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:23,460
sort of a pain and it essentially event

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:27,720
and eventually ended up getting replaced

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:32,159
by by xorg openoffice is probably one of

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,840
the more visible ones there's there are

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,970
multiple competing forks at present

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,080
there's the bruh office there's the

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:42,240
apache version you know at some point

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,330
one of these will demonstrate some clear

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,139
superiority over the other one until

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:51,289
then they're all equally valid right

00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:53,820
that's earth MPEG is is yet another one

00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:55,470
that there's probably another half dozen

00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,330
more than that we could come up with if

00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,279
we thought about it sometimes these are

00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,570
splits for technical reasons let me GCS

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,119
painful and sometimes it's just people

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,519
not getting on so the ffmpeg and live AV

00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,799
pretty much the same software that

00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,710
people just hate each other had a big

00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:12,809
falling out very annoying the rest of

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,730
the tiny differences foods almost

00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,860
compatible libraries and it looks like

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,450
after four years of throwing mud each

00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,820
other they might be about to merge

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,289
against know why I'm hoping that people

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,039
have got over that particular fight

00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:27,179
right yeah and it can be anything from

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,830
yeah it can be anything from just people

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:32,970
disagreeing with each other technical

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,350
reasons it can be who knows that it

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:39,200
could be any number of reasons for a

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:42,440
fork to occur but they will happen okay

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,490
but the key question in all of this is

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,499
you know so you're trying to explain to

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,539
your manager you know how to get

00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:50,580
evaluated on this when when will

00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,980
schedule be how can I guarantee that

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,330
something gets shipped and you're

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,070
telling your manager no we can't really

00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,259
do any of those things so why should we

00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,559
do this well simple fact of the matter

00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:05,100
is you are accessing a pool of resources

00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,429
that is enormous it is a pool of

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,730
resources that you would never ever

00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:12,250
possibly be able to get ahold of

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:16,120
your own company so think about just

00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:18,430
linaro itself right over 200 developers

00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,800
are in linaro your company can just

00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:23,890
easily tap into all of those developers

00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,690
and and you get access to everything

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:28,180
that they're doing done and the

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:33,610
discussion what if you tried to go hire

00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:37,210
those 200 developers it is just not

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:40,630
possible if you had infinite money maybe

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:43,410
you could but this nobody does and

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,190
budgets are always getting tired okay

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,950
but what this does is it allows

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,170
everybody to get what they need and

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:57,720
allows them to contribute what they can

00:28:50,170 --> 00:29:05,280
provide oh it sounded very Marxist but

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:05,280
you know it's without how do I say this

00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,710
it this does not preclude you from

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,420
taking some of these resources and

00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,020
accessing some of these resources and

00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,030
making something commercial out of them

00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,850
the next slider to will show you some of

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,470
the examples of where this has been done

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,180
but what this also does one of the key

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,340
things here is because you have access

00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,380
to all of these resources you can get

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,290
started from a much higher point in the

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,150
ecosystem you can get much more useful

00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,640
work than because now you suddenly don't

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:42,120
have to worry about operating systems

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,670
you don't have to worry about compilers

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,680
little side story a good friend of mine

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:49,450
was very excited when the Cray three

00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,120
that this company ordered finally got

00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,860
delivered and he asked the the

00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,100
installation engineer after he was done

00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:59,290
as it took two weeks to install where's

00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,120
where's my tapes of compilers and

00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,130
operating systems and the engineer just

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,300
kind of looked at him and said we

00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:11,620
shipped you a computer well you have to

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,880
write all that in this case within a

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,530
week or so he was actually up and

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,730
running stuff because he started from a

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:20,590
GCC base but that's the kind of thing

00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,900
that you can do is you can get things up

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,490
and running quickly you can

00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,960
things that are common to almost

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,970
everybody and problems that have been

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,550
solved and just reuse that instead of

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:34,180
having to go off and do it all yourself

00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:37,120
this is very expensive probably the

00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,130
other thing is if you you can just get

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,160
things done this is one of the things I

00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:44,830
love best about open source is you see a

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,830
problem you see how to fix it you can

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:50,230
just go do it it that you don't have to

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:52,900
ask for permission you don't have to go

00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:56,980
talk to the lawyers and get them to okay

00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:59,200
it you can just do it and what you do

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:04,120
may become a value to somebody else

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,980
later on yes I in contrast it might take

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,420
years to get something upstream that you

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,910
want it equally you can get something

00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,710
done in three days and it allows the VA

00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,090
or your management will be amazed that

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,920
you did all this work in no time at all

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,720
actually didn't really do any work

00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,130
except reading it off the internet thank

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,020
you work your particular purpose and

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,670
there you go so some things can be

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,840
incredibly quick but a very slow in

00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:27,520
virtual world and vice versa right right

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,130
well in and the other example of that is

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,570
when you find buds you know people have

00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,610
so much pride in what it is that they've

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,080
done we're often than not you can you

00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,840
can poke the developer and say you know

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,060
I think this might be broken and you

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,160
know days of you can get fixes and hours

00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,780
right that you couldn't do with

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,710
proprietary software in any way shape or

00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:54,280
form oh so what does open source give

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:57,630
you well amazing things expect the

00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,630
unexpected is a bit of an understatement

00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:03,790
you can never tell what people will come

00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,770
up with leave a poor starving grad

00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:09,660
student alone in a computer lab

00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:13,530
overnight and who knows what'll happen

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:17,410
just amazing things happen but you can

00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:19,930
you can just go off and do that but you

00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:21,580
can't predict it it may turn out to be

00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,010
something wildly different from where

00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:28,180
you started but that's okay these things

00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:29,560
happen at you know and again who knows

00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,680
what crazy stuff people are going to

00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,140
come up with but it's amazing what it's

00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,840
amazing what has happened in the last 10

00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,220
years in terms of just

00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,809
linux itself there were people that said

00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,490
it would never amount to much of

00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:46,409
anything and yet it's running on

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,799
everything from handsets the

00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:52,650
supercomputers and everything in between

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,960
and you can do that without messing

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:58,250
around with all of the nasty stuff like

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,730
the licensing managers and having to go

00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:03,809
you know send in emails to a particular

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,000
organization and they'll send you back

00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:08,100
some enormous key that of course gets

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,010
cut and pasted wrong because you forgot

00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,470
the last two characters of it and none

00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:17,399
of that stuff you just go about getting

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:21,720
your work done and people have done this

00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:23,610
in such amazing places that most of the

00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,779
infrastructure or most by what

00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,240
infrastructure is not the right word

00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:31,260
most of the things that people associate

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,270
with the internet and all the wonderful

00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,840
things it has done most of those are

00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:40,500
based on open source google amazon

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,659
facebook yahoo wikipedia i mean name

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,510
name as many as you want almost all of

00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,870
that stuff is is either completely open

00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:50,760
source or mostly open source and an

00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,880
excellent source on this is Evan Mullins

00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:57,570
video we talked about innovation under

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,669
asperity I have not personally watched

00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,820
it and I think I need to but but we

00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:06,720
would wiki highly recommends it so I

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:07,980
trust that okay all right and working

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,379
with the community some of the key

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,300
things that you need to remember is it

00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,649
what you're asked when you're working

00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,450
with the community one of the things

00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:19,369
that you're doing is you are asking for

00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:21,720
their time and energy to help you okay

00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:23,639
just keep that in the back of your head

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,070
because what you're actually asking them

00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,710
to do is to do some work for you now you

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:31,260
are saying in exchange I will will do

00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,570
some work for you as well that's fine

00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:37,830
but remember what you're asking for of

00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:40,200
people so no constant ping saying you

00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,450
know is my patch accept it is my patch

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,869
accept it is my patch accepted these are

00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:47,250
very very busy people dealing with

00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:49,740
hundreds thousands of patches a day

00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,790
perhaps so don't expect an immediate

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,380
response

00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,600
be respectful of their time and energy

00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:56,220
as well but that's one of the things

00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,800
that you want from them you want their

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,080
their their work in reviewing your

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,990
patches and their ideas on how things

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:07,740
might be better or bugs that they might

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:09,570
see but that's tapping into their

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,070
expertise that's where you get all of

00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:14,310
these resources to actually get

00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,350
something done okay but remember the key

00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,240
thing in my mind is always that I am

00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:26,940
asking somebody to sacrifice some of

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:32,220
their time and energy to help me this

00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:33,930
goes two ways right you want to make

00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,520
sure that what you're doing actually

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,590
benefits the community that you're

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,450
participating in you know for the

00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,730
colonel that's your possibly new

00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,100
features better functionality lower

00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,240
power usage whatever it might be but

00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,760
it's something that actually makes the

00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,630
Linux kernel a better place than it is

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,030
today but that seemed that same premise

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,760
holds true for openoffice it holds true

00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:59,870
for Apache any of them but they're

00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:03,810
really interested in you contributing is

00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:06,090
things that fit things that improve

00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:09,500
what's there things that make the

00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:13,620
experience better for everybody involved

00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:16,170
but the key thing to remember is as I've

00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:18,660
been reminded repeatedly the only power

00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:23,130
that an upstream maintainer actually has

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:25,200
is the ability to say no nobody has to

00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:29,780
take your work under any circumstances

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,880
whatsoever okay it is your job to

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:35,460
demonstrate that what you are doing is a

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,760
value contributes to the community and

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,310
helps improve things it's not their job

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:47,550
to demonstrate that for you it is your

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:50,520
job but that value to the community can

00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,990
take a lot of different forms more often

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,260
than not it has to be if something

00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:57,810
interesting right has to be work that

00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,440
maybe nobody else knows how to do or

00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:03,150
maybe nobody else is even willing to do

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,810
the whole notion of Linux plumbers kind

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,010
of fell out of that notion

00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:09,370
that we need people to go back and

00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:11,440
maintain the source that's there and

00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,820
it's kind of a thankless job in some

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,110
ways because nobody really wants to do

00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,480
maintenance they want to go off and

00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:18,280
create all the new stuff but it's now a

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,460
critical task and a lot of people are

00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:25,690
involved in it but that's where they

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:30,250
contribute to the community the other

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:32,050
thing is you can't hide stuff I run into

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:35,410
this repeatedly and a particular project

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:38,980
I'm working on where any documentation

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:41,710
that you cannot share openly is in a way

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,050
and hostile act as what you're saying to

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,550
somebody at that point is here look at

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,740
this wonderful exciting interesting

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,170
thing that I've done I'm going to give

00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,180
it to you but I'm not going to tell you

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,580
how to prove that it actually works or

00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:59,440
that it's useful you just have to trust

00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:01,420
me no you have to earn the trust you

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,040
have to demonstrate merit in what it is

00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:08,140
that you're doing by intentionally

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,400
keeping information behind the nda's or

00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:15,610
behind a registration only wall or god

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,400
forbid a paywall even you're actually

00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:21,640
impeding anybody from evaluating your

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:26,140
work and it's it's considered basically

00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:32,430
a hostile act you're trying to force

00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:35,790
something down that's it will not fly ok

00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:45,130
this is this yeah this is lace bit here

00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:47,830
so lately right so really coming back

00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:50,050
down to what the community is well what

00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,240
is the community what is the anatomy of

00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,920
an open source project many of these

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,530
products are quite different they've

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,150
been created for different reasons they

00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,160
have maintained it with different

00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,590
personalities they have different

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,150
priorities you have some projects that

00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,830
are completely commercially driven and

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,990
they just decide that open source is the

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:12,160
correct development model for us and you

00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:15,070
have some that are entirely driven by

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,700
the principles and opinions of whoever

00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,700
found at the project

00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,280
so because of this different projects

00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:27,520
work differently and when you need to

00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,200
start working on a new project and you

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,760
need to start interacting with a new

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,790
community you kind of need to pay some

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,620
attention to the culture of that

00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,630
specific project when you start

00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,060
interacting with people and if you do

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:45,100
take care and do take that time you will

00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,720
find that you will get have a lot easier

00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:52,710
time actually getting your patches

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:55,600
accepted upstream so the the traditional

00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,160
thing people tell you which can be

00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:02,200
difficult if you're under time pressure

00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:04,690
is Merc if if you have a new project you

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,300
want to start maybe you find a mailing

00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,220
list you join the mailing list you say

00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,280
nothing on the mailing list not even

00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,190
hike you just sit there and read the

00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,290
emails for a while and try to figure out

00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:20,620
what is the cultural code on this

00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:23,500
mailing list some mailing lists because

00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,960
the development environment that the

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,290
majority of the developers use on on

00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,300
that mailing list they may want all of

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,190
the patches you send to the mailing list

00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,940
to be in the form of attachments to the

00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:39,130
email other mailing lists for other

00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,830
projects for exactly the same reasons

00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,500
but different tools absolutely do not

00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:46,630
want patches to be sent as attachments

00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,360
so getting something on that level wrong

00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:52,600
as as your first as you send in your

00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:55,240
first contribution will give people on

00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,160
that mailing list a less favorable

00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,910
impression of you and that will make

00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:03,100
your work harder after that but it's

00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,020
also important to figure out what for

00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,420
more modes of communications are

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:10,270
actually being actively used by this

00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,270
development project is you have some

00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:15,520
projects that know maybe they started

00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,160
out in storage forge a few years back

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,660
and then they move to github and they

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,970
never properly closed down the old

00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,980
mailing list and maybe some people still

00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,410
say things there but not the people who

00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,460
are actively working on it so you know

00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,470
track down what's the actual canonical

00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,430
source of communication for for that

00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:39,270
project and have a look there again

00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:41,430
depending on the community developing

00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:44,160
that project some of them use

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:48,180
exclusively mailing lists some of them

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,089
use mailing lists web-based forums IRC

00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:53,550
and some run almost entirely on IRC and

00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:55,530
it can very quiet mailing lists but they

00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,210
still have a mailing list so again

00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,070
that's why it's important to find out

00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,470
what are the four to communication

00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:04,560
people using this project so you can

00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:06,630
actually follow up and see what's how

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,040
that project really communicate with

00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:12,810
each other and hardly need them use

00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:15,359
Facebook it might be true anymore might

00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:19,200
be some you say that that is also a

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:23,580
dangerous assumption old-fashioned ones

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,490
don't use Facebook yeah absolutely so

00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:29,580
some basic rules of engagement I call it

00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:33,540
by basic sort of things you to that tend

00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:36,089
to be common across many projects so

00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,800
many projects like using IRC because

00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:40,050
it's more instant communication and you

00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,630
can get a discussion going quite quickly

00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,720
but it's mailing lists exploding into

00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:50,010
threads of hundreds of emails can get a

00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,770
bit tedious so the way this often works

00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:55,440
on IRC is you have some people they're

00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,720
always logged into an IRC channel

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,890
they're always there they might mark

00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,599
themselves away when they're not

00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:05,540
actually paying attention but they're

00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:09,540
always there and because of that you

00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:11,750
know people come and asked quite

00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,950
frequently on quite many IRC channels

00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,650
sometimes commend the new to project

00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:20,849
they want to be polite they come in and

00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:23,369
they say I and no one responds because

00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:25,050
they're just sitting there maybe they're

00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:26,910
not coming back checking their IRC log

00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,560
for another eight hours and if they do

00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:31,859
they're not going to reply to someone

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,930
who said hi eight hours ago so the next

00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:36,450
thing that people sometimes do is they

00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:40,320
ask again trying to be polite can I ask

00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:42,820
you a question but again coming back

00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,860
eight hours later maybe the person who

00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,680
can I ask you a question didn't get an

00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,930
answer bugged out and now you couldn't

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,270
even say yes you are welcome to ask a

00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,910
question because the person isn't there

00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:58,690
to hear your response the generally

00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:01,270
almost always the the format on the on

00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:05,950
IRC is just if you have a question just

00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:08,350
ask the question because that way people

00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:10,210
can immediately note that okay this is

00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,340
something I know about our pay attention

00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:17,370
I'll write a quick response and and so

00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:19,600
on also because you know these are

00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:22,030
global projects people all around the

00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,250
world are working on these projects so

00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,980
what I said about these people are

00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,990
always online if you come in ask your

00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,180
question you don't get a reply for two

00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:34,420
hours and you log back out of the

00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:37,810
channel someone comes in five seconds

00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:40,960
later looks at their log goes oh I can

00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:43,690
answer that Oh they've left you can't

00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,540
find them to to respond to them so it's

00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:49,660
a very good idea to to find a way either

00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:52,360
you know a shell account somewhere with

00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,880
a screen session which you can detach

00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:58,510
from and keep the RSC session alive even

00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,820
though you log out or we have some IRC

00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:03,160
proxy thing in Donora you can use as

00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:08,500
well which keeps you constantly on that

00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:11,350
channel the other thing is try not to

00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:14,290
ask individual people questions if you

00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:16,540
come into the lenoir enterprise channel

00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:19,300
for example well obviously for a very

00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,550
friendly channel but anyway many people

00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,910
in that channel may know the answer to

00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:26,440
the question you have but if you ask a

00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:29,110
question specifically aimed at one

00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,470
person everyone other than that person

00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:33,910
quite likely to ignore you so if you

00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,560
have a question just ask the question

00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:39,760
don't post it to a specific individual

00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,160
especially don't ask in private chat

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,890
because that can be a bit frustrating

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,260
you get sometimes someone you have no

00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:51,220
idea where they are they come in and ask

00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:53,560
you some random question and said you

00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,049
don't know who they are and no one else

00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,959
is going to see anything you reply

00:45:56,049 --> 00:46:00,880
so thing you have with IRC at least the

00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:03,609
lanai RAC channels many other IRC

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,410
channels they have a bot that log of the

00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:08,109
communications in the channel and then

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:10,539
publishes that on the web software so if

00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:13,269
at a later date someone else comes up

00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:15,429
and wonder the same thing they type it

00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:19,119
into Google or potentially some other

00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:20,769
search engine and they can find it

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,140
because the questions been asked and the

00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:25,509
messages involved but if you ask it

00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,949
directly to an individual that will be

00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:29,349
in a private chat and something that

00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:33,489
won't be like so it's always best to ask

00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:34,900
you know in the open public channel that

00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:36,549
of course does not apply to people you

00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,839
know if you have a specific question for

00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:39,519
them that you know that they're the

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,929
correct person and it might be a bit

00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:42,789
commercially sensitive so you'd maybe

00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:45,429
don't want to ask it in the open channel

00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:48,039
but as a generic rule I've absolutely

00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:52,269
asked directly and asking the open

00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:56,529
channel also try to stay on topic for

00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:58,119
the channel random discussion IRC

00:46:56,529 --> 00:47:00,819
channels can be really useful as well

00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:04,329
and we've just created the Lenora

00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:06,910
watercooler IRC channel on the Lenora

00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:08,229
site because a sometimes you just want

00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,920
to chat and we have a distributed

00:47:08,229 --> 00:47:13,779
organization and you might have many

00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,179
easy places to find that but if you're

00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:21,369
going on something specific like say the

00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:22,900
arm linux kernel IRC channel then you

00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:24,489
probably want to stay on topic because

00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,599
there's a lot of people on that channel

00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:31,569
and they will be discussing some white

00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:34,689
advanced topics and they don't want to

00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:39,609
get random hey have you been type

00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:41,289
discussions in the channel as a rose on

00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:43,630
the narrow channels are obviously a lot

00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:45,069
more movies because it's at their kind

00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,809
of our office even in the narrow

00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:48,880
enterprise we tend to have a lot of just

00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:51,189
chat going on but that's kind of like

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,259
the the office chat we would have if all

00:47:51,189 --> 00:47:56,170
of us working together we're sitting in

00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:58,660
the same office whereas if it's a

00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,609
specific project specific channel but

00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,679
you're not really a core member of them

00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:06,420
it's better to try to keep the

00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,420
day-to-day chat somewhere else

00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:15,719
that's priority mailing lists many

00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:18,299
things quite similar I mentioned patches

00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:21,979
for example some mailing lists want all

00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:25,049
patches and attachments some lists want

00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:27,869
no patches ever centers attachment just

00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:30,119
send them in line with a gift for my

00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:31,650
patch and get send email because that's

00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,689
really good for their workflow and they

00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:37,979
can just comment in line and makes there

00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:39,299
were very easy I don't know of any

00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:41,489
mailing list in the face of this planet

00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:45,539
that those open source development that

00:48:41,489 --> 00:48:48,420
likes HTML formatted email there might

00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:51,630
be ones that won't get angry at you for

00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,150
posting HTML formatted email they might

00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:57,589
just think it's a bit tedious but if

00:48:54,150 --> 00:49:00,930
you're sitting like many of us do

00:48:57,589 --> 00:49:04,459
reading your emails through a console

00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:07,439
based text email client like Mutt and

00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:09,180
you do your your patch reviewing and

00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:11,880
commenting straight in the text

00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:14,699
environment someone throwing like HTML

00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:17,209
with CSS sources straight into

00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:21,749
everything tends to get people bit upset

00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:27,239
so it's good to stay away from that some

00:49:21,749 --> 00:49:29,910
lists automatically or manually refuse

00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:31,739
emails with automatically added legal

00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:34,529
disclaimer so the little footer at the

00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:36,269
bottom of the email that says this

00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:37,890
information is confidential if you are

00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:41,699
not the intended recipient da da da da

00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:44,609
da if you want to ever get a patch into

00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:47,519
the arm linux kernel and you have a

00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:49,799
disclaimer like that you won't all right

00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,140
they will not take your patches unless

00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:55,619
you can find a situation that lets you

00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:58,589
send plain clear patches that contain

00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:02,759
the actual patches on the perhaps

00:49:58,589 --> 00:50:05,009
slightly obstinate opinion that you're

00:50:02,759 --> 00:50:08,279
telling me i might not have the right to

00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:11,339
read this this is GPL software these two

00:50:08,279 --> 00:50:14,519
statements are not compatible either

00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:16,979
it's GPL software and I can read it or I

00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:18,959
might not have the right to read it then

00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:21,200
it's not GPL software and it cannot be

00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:23,880
accepted by this project

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,540
I'm fully aware that in some

00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:30,630
organizations that can be difficult but

00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,450
the you may have outgoing email servers

00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:37,099
that automatically add these photos you

00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,099
have to find a way to work around that

00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:44,730
as I also said if you have the time

00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:46,470
subscribe to mailing list in advance and

00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,440
read the post for a few weeks without

00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:53,250
participating actively just to see how

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,530
people communicate you know how people

00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:58,020
who get their patches accepted seem to

00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,430
be communicating and how people who

00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,230
don't appear to get their practice

00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:03,510
accepted seem to be communicating and

00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:09,510
try to do more of the first and less

00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:12,030
than the second if you don't have time

00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,980
to sit back and lurk for a few weeks you

00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:15,330
usually have the mailing list archive

00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,920
still you can go and read the

00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,990
communications that have already been on

00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:23,310
the list in the preceding weeks and and

00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:25,950
see how that is but same like IRC don't

00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:28,020
contact individuals directly off list if

00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,580
you know if there are amazing people and

00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,170
you're convinced that they will have the

00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,670
answer to specifically your question

00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:34,830
because they have so much experience in

00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,359
this you can safely assume that another

00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:40,190
100 people have thought that in the past

00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:43,290
month and that doesn't lead them to be

00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:46,890
people to be very happy to get these

00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:48,599
types of questions even if you know the

00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:50,400
theory the only one who have the

00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,290
information you're after I'd even if no

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,420
one else could know it still ask it on

00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:57,330
the open list because if it's on the

00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:01,140
open list again it will get logged in

00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:03,089
mailing list archive and future times

00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:05,220
when anyone might have the same question

00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:13,589
they can find it by searching on Google

00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:16,230
it's a lot more efficient common just

00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:18,030
common sense rules always search for the

00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:20,040
answer first even if you think it's a

00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,900
really really really obscure question

00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,390
there's a lot of software development

00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,220
going on in the world and even if you

00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,500
think no one will ever have seen this

00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:32,130
problem before you might find ten people

00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:34,000
who have whatever tougher play research

00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,840
engine just

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,490
if you're getting an error message

00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,280
trying to do something paste the error

00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,390
message into Google you'll be surprised

00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,340
how often they will end up with

00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:47,480
something sensible sometimes doesn't

00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:50,630
absolutely but if that happens and you

00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,190
can't find anything searching around do

00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:54,500
you tell people when you're asking a

00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:57,020
question on IRC or on the mailing list I

00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,850
tried sir rich in Google you know for

00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:02,690
other instances with this app and I try

00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:05,180
doing this and I ran out of ideas can

00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,730
you help me that shows that you could

00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,710
smell it into it and that makes people

00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:13,640
more likely to want to take their climax

00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:15,620
and help you and provide lots of

00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,990
information not irrelevant information

00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:21,170
but make sure you provide enough

00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:22,940
information that the people on the

00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:25,700
mailing list or the IRC channel where

00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:28,490
you're asking this question understand

00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:32,570
what your problem is that's it's very

00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:35,540
common that people try to distill down

00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:37,280
and think oh I think this problem i have

00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,410
is being caused by this tiny little

00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,030
thing over here and then they mentioned

00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:43,310
i'm having this problem with this little

00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:45,770
thing over here turns out that wasn't

00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:47,240
the problem and you know if you spend

00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:49,160
two weeks going back and forth and

00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,720
mailing list getting to the point where

00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,730
someone tells you but that's not your

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,100
problem your problems over there then

00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:57,980
you know dual effect that we have wasted

00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,660
people's time and they will be less

00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:05,240
inclined to want to help you in the

00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:08,390
future the preferred where possible way

00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:11,330
of asking a question is by providing a

00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:14,030
short self-contained correct and compile

00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:17,180
herbal example meaning something that

00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:18,770
they can take on their machine try to

00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,900
reproduce what you are seeing and

00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:22,910
preferably also actually reproduce what

00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,800
you see even if it's a program that

00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:26,750
doesn't build that doesn't work if you

00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,690
provide the information so that they can

00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:32,630
come to the same situation when they try

00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:35,180
to look on their machine they be in a

00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:37,490
block better position to a find a

00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:39,800
solution but be it'll take a lot less

00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:43,190
effort for them and you know you want to

00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,630
get people who you want help from to

00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:48,970
spend as little effort as possible

00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,970
because then they feel very good about

00:54:52,390 --> 00:55:00,050
final slide this is also the narrow part

00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:02,440
of what linaro offers to its members is

00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:04,490
that we have a fair amount of

00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:07,760
experienced open source developers

00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:09,560
around here to help you guys if you want

00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,190
to learn things about how these things

00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:16,190
work we have a dinner dash mentors are a

00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:19,340
channel where you can go out and just

00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:22,310
ask any type of question is you're not

00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:24,800
sure how to approach this community you

00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:26,510
think you might have made someone upset

00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,940
you want to see if there's any way you

00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:32,360
can try to some help you can have to

00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:34,160
sort that out come ask us anything you

00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,610
know the note there are no two stupid

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:40,550
questions for that channel and there's

00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:43,670
also the Leonardo dev mailing list which

00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:45,410
is pretty much any type of development

00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:48,860
question you have on anything Lin are

00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:55,880
related is is fair game for that channel
