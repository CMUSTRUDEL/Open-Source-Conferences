	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
you've used securities if you think any

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,240
of these frameworks obviously we have a

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,730
lot of vested interest in these

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,740
frameworks we have maintained errs

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,200
working for us who maintain these

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,199
frameworks we have a lot of

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,020
contributions here is the same with the

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,539
tools so we've created tools for our own

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,310
analysis we've created tools for on

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,029
functional testing to make sure that

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,680
p.m. QA so whether we have the right

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,140
power management functionality on when

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,190
the platform for us to be in from school

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,200
I mean put it all out there so I mean

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,180
these are there are things we create for

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
our own use but then we put it out there

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,230
Steve members are found it useful in

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:50,760
most cases they have so we've done a

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,219
bunch of work around improving CPU wake

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,690
up sore minimizing CPU wake-ups so

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,489
you've done work around no hurts we've

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:03,149
done work around work queues are

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:05,309
efficient work queues and dynamic irq

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,920
affinity so these are things which I've

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,740
noticed all of this work is in Maine

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,470
mind whether and some vendors are using

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,689
it us maybe others are not aware of it

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,960
so this was another way of and these

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,720
were smaller projects inside inside p.m.

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
WG and so on not a whole lot of a pitch

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,549
goes into it when in writing up reports

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,710
and in all the member report so this was

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:34,860
another way of drawing attention to

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:38,250
these this kind of work and then so I

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,159
Heather and then your hibernation are we

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,340
up straining the core support for

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,610
hibernation on arm we've done some work

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,000
around adding frequency capping for Tom

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:57,740
cooling which arm is not taking into the

00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,740
next level by their work on IPA so yeah

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,909
so I'm using any of this work done in

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,429
the last couple fields this is this is a

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,150
significant work that we've done in

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,890
linaro

00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:16,490
if you are using any of this and you're

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,850
interested to UM down to us we nothing

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:24,140
to get you to work with them we are also

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,120
talking to the ALS je maar prom see

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,010
which of these makes sense to be

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,720
backported some of these matches could

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,850
be back water if you let us care for you

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,850
use so we are working with Dennis well

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:42,110
so theme currently with 12 people plus

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:47,390
myself six of the charts I needs we have

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:51,560
a sinus from Margaret companies if one

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:58,220
from Hawaii to Qualcomm to media tech

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:59,870
and when it's T this one we have in the

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,510
room one more media tech assignee

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,600
achievement my team doesn't know is is a

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:10,640
new signings wouldn't join now so

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:14,450
freedom don't they scattered all over

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,080
the world so it's a lot of time zones

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,870
there and one thing that has been

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,430
important inside the BMW genius being

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,380
able to maintain Lee is going forward

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:30,380
maintaining some of the key components

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:31,640
of forward so all these guys are some of

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,150
these guys are maintained errs of these

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:39,400
key subsystems we care about CQ I do see

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:42,410
club frame program actually clock events

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,570
we also have for our now working for a

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,360
second ro us if you freak maintenance

00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:54,020
right so these are things that we feel

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:58,239
is going best control control our own

00:03:54,020 --> 00:04:02,209
destinies innocence as the arm ecosystem

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,510
so I finally another meter project is

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:10,370
divided against itself so that's really

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:13,820
I'll go first yeah okay I manager

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,420
tivities if you ask me where I live the

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,280
next time the answer mine

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:25,260
sing so that's that's just in the last

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:27,180
year and a half that's not my own by the

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,680
way but it's a nice picture I found in

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,380
that lower religious so one of the key

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,250
things from me personally is new here

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,320
for converse about hacks they have to

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,970
put in place an hour manhunt frameworks

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,479
to get things to work on a solution so

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,710
if you are the workaround frameworks

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,200
this is something that will be in the

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,919
beauty is meant to solve so talk to us

00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:01,050
about that and we'll find ways to solve

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:03,240
for you I mean doing this so what are

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,830
your nose raising and don't mind to each

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,500
of my engineers we're going to talk

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,040
about what they are doing any pero most

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,830
of us wear multiple hats someone

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,970
maintainer is but they also project is

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,220
five-time projects so just talk about it

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:27,810
and feel free to ask questions into a

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:31,110
facility the next good morning everyone

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,210
I took a hit him and I'm assignee to

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:38,640
power management working group from

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:41,750
Huawei i live in tampere finland and the

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,700
guava office where I'm supposed to

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,880
locate its hundred miles so that's a bit

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,550
of a commute so actually most of the

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,190
time I'm working from home sometimes I

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,390
have to do this wonderful wonderful 100

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,650
mile from here in the power management

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:04,080
group currently I am

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:06,699
on our big task which is working

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,330
collaboration with arm and tiana folks

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:12,520
to come up with energy-aware scheduler

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,919
which is the thing that they will be

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:20,530
hearing what about today and all of the

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:24,960
week and in particular exact field i'm

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:28,360
brittany is integration of CD fretboard

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,539
actually it's both actually replacing

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,370
the governor governor's with EAS

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:37,389
implementation so what we are doing

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:40,449
right now is we are creating a system

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:44,860
where my scheduler will indicate both

00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:49,300
desire capitan capacity of the cpa

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:52,720
should be and in the future the EAS will

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,030
be giving this but when we lose is much

00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,930
simpler implementation who paved the way

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,930
for that on unified EAS implementation

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,410
as a persian line quite simple there are

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,150
not many things in my life so if you

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,370
want to talk something other than a

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,199
shock for you can talk to me about in

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,449
bowl games actually on this three-point

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,970
would be premium access in like five key

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,280
lots of people watch stiffen much so

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,430
again mainly in my people games i have

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:31,150
three at home and if you want to talk

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:33,909
show I spent quite many years thinking

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,659
about the selection of an estate so when

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:40,330
you have not asked to run yes number

00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:42,310
stays you can go into and choosing one

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,860
it's not so simple especially if you

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:50,349
have multiple cores and there won't be

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:52,870
dependencies between this or and yeah

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:55,090
one of my favorite hobbies if it's like

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,699
not very but computers I'd like to do

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,099
everything with a BGA its hardware so I

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,169
could buy a five-dollar microcontroller

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,720
and do something but instead of that I

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:10,979
usually prefer to go ahead AJ because

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,979
it's so nice to try it vhdl okay

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:19,940
let's give a nice hello hello my name is

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,680
Kevin I am based I also work from my

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,840
home I think most of us do I work for my

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,580
home in Seattle so I had one of the

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,140
shorter flights here at four this week i

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,540
work for linara i'm an employee of

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,400
linaro and i work on a lot of things

00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,650
related to kind of core power management

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,710
frameworks so I'm particularly

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,710
interested in suspend resume kind of

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:45,350
core runtime p.m. course if you idle CPU

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,360
free for all those things and particular

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,590
I'm very interested in a lot of the ways

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,740
that people are putting these together

00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,540
so if you a lot of people I like to

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,940
review what people are doing with these

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,920
frameworks and a lot of people put them

00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,860
together in clever and interesting and

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,060
sometimes not very clever ways and so if

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,650
you have ideas of how these work

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,150
together or how they should work

00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,090
together better I'd love to talk to you

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:10,430
as well so i hope that quite a few of

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:15,230
different ways of implementing these

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:17,990
frameworks own i also it's not exactly

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,880
related to this team but I one of my

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,250
previous life so I was maintaining the

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,810
home app the TI OMAP power man from the

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,090
infrastructure so I credibility of quite

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,460
a few TI boards and so I kind of

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,130
automated a bunch of tests for those and

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,810
then once I start working for ritalin

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,120
roi added a couple boards and started

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:38,510
publishing kind of automated boot test

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,250
for these and as I did that people like

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,800
what i was doing is just started sending

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:46,610
the boards so now i'm up to about 40

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,410
boards in my in my small backyard office

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,770
that's running every time there's a new

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,720
main line linux next stable or LSK

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,900
colonel it actually boots across all

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,810
these different arm boards and I email

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,320
out a report to to that so that's kind

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:07,250
of become a little bit of a side project

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,470
I'm also working on this kind of a basic

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,180
support for the Chromebook to platform

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,730
that our team is kind of using as a as a

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,980
reference big little platform so making

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:20,450
sure that infrastructure pieces for that

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,649
platform are upstream I'm helping as

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,050
kind of a backup

00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:26,600
with Arne Berkman and Olaf Johansson who

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:29,300
are maintaining arm SOC stuff upstream

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,569
I'm helping kind step in there when

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,399
needed and I guess I'm not I'm not

00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:36,740
actively working on this anymore but I

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,569
get I helped get the kind of the no

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,579
birds the full ticklish stuff upstream

00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:45,529
for Armand I'm 64 so I guess that's uh

00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:54,860
that's kind of the bulk of what I'm

00:10:45,529 --> 00:11:00,259
doing for the Dharma was next no well so

00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:02,509
I work for Paul Kong sorry I had an even

00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:06,589
shorter trip here so I drove from San

00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:08,660
Diego up here was a nice drive I'm going

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:12,499
to take a vacation and then on the way

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,990
back what so ever drive and I'm like to

00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:17,509
guy have a very short commute to work so

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,730
I Sam on half of my time bringing from

00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:22,189
home about half of my time working from

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,839
the office five miles away at the steam

00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:29,389
works that and I've been working with

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,050
computers since many new before men who

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:37,569
were born from a punch far as an IBM

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:41,420
mainframe in 1974 I remember loading PDP

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:44,870
gates I think on paper day booting BS e

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,519
2.9 unix and i can ii and working with

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,100
unix and linux pretty much ever since

00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,499
then so I love our conv when it's Carl

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,990
and the other winning stuff that you

00:11:51,499 --> 00:12:00,399
know is user space thats related to it

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:03,439
linaro so far I've been working on my

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,779
first project was to extend a lot of the

00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:09,649
work that Kevin had been doing on alerts

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:12,139
and its arms key for contracts tracker

00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:14,449
work which remembers when our

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:18,290
reservation upstream and it's in 317

00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:20,059
when I understand and idle stat I've

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:25,960
been writing code video with energy

00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:28,120
model and first Arab has been written in

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,900
new code room arm that needs to be

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:35,080
looked at it eats the best of it needs

00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,530
to be put into our tree doing some work

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:41,980
here in fact and I'm also working again

00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:44,620
with javed on some of them getting from

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,870
book to working eventually I will be

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,960
playing with EAS colonel on Chromebook

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,770
crude way we can get it fixing it and

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,780
doing things of that sort things my

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,960
hobbies I Lieberman number theory

00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,700
research I used to be if anybody's heard

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,160
of it one of the judges of the office

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,030
gated C code content seven years ago I

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:11,560
also many years ago Mike playing pinball

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:13,150
1970s era pinball machines and also it

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,910
just did things like the stock market

00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:25,680
and sports like baseball and football

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:25,680
sorry about the Seahawks chargers etc I

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:44,790
don't do what I just being told to two

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:51,190
people talking a few minutes ago and

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:54,300
read your email I can't bro mediatek in

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:58,600
Taiwan and my previous work experience

00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:03,880
most about to Colonel porting in the

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:06,190
driver driver tip em but fortune I've

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,530
been Mineiro connect for several times

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:17,130
but this is the first time I stand here

00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:21,520
and talk I feel good what I'm doing now

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:27,210
how much will place energy-aware

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:33,700
schedule and analog streaming my habit

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:35,660
si si right here electronically tart and

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:40,620
I

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:44,640
also write a toast transcript scratch so

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:54,690
if anyone have habits staying with me we

00:14:44,640 --> 00:15:00,540
can talk in private that's it everyone

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:03,150
um yeah so I'm Mike that's me and I'm

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,070
right now based in Los Angeles that are

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,990
kind of like kinda like ah man I move

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,600
around a lot of my wife nine so we just

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,270
put the Los Angeles but maybe next year

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,190
is connected will be a different story

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,870
and coming to San Francisco school

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,480
because we used to live here as well so

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,190
it's like coming back home eleonora I

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,910
maintained the common clock framework

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:27,740
and that's more like more of a recent

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,480
framework against version 3 dot 44 and

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,350
lots of people in here expenditures or

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,730
somehow get involved and stuff that it's

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,980
maybe hitting time to rewrite parts of

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,140
it I was told the USB subsystem three

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,970
written three times the colonel so like

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,800
I'm wondering it time for clock

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,440
framework version two and we talk about

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,780
that while we're here mostly what I will

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,810
turn about these days is the keyword

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:54,540
scheduling stuff along with tube I'm

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:57,930
involved with the cpu freakin scheduler

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,370
integration and so is this this

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,800
connected got really interesting timing

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,090
because there's a bunch of not much but

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,300
there's definitely some patches that

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,500
were that it's just now time to really

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,850
start looking at things so it'll be a

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,760
lot of over the shoulder patch review

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:15,030
over here and hopefully some patches in

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,580
the list during this week as well and my

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,680
you know interests are similar to what

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,480
others have said you know cpu freaked

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,660
everyone out of the pool power

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,240
management frameworks i spent some time

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,800
should be an Android devices

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,810
semiconductor manufacturers so you know

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,060
I've done all the same crazy hack to the

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,920
roads of you and my comment would say

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,370
it's interesting to know what hacks are

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,720
being done today maybe we can get rid of

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,600
those acts and replace it with some you

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,790
have a useful infrastructure instead and

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,170
then I maintain a second-tier poor

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,500
farmer compared

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,389
Kevin enola so not lose many boards and

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,550
what I'm trying to build right now I

00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,860
mostly have working is a power

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,180
regression testing suite I really would

00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,029
like to solicit feedback from you guys

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,250
as much as possible my the general idea

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,140
right now is for every major curl

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,449
release and maybe for every RC tag that

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,520
comes out to for all the boards that I

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,240
have gets you know run some workloads

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,760
get some power tests and in a basically

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,770
test regressions as a percentage of you

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,720
know energy consumed change so it's not

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,100
publishing power numbers you guys don't

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,419
have to worry about like you know secret

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,540
numbers being released at any one

00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:26,610
convention but instead you know sort of

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,660
seeing if through the course of all the

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,530
RC cycles in for you know seen any

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,929
regressions with respect to energy

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,340
consumption so if you guys want to

00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,990
donate boards to that or if you just

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,120
want to talk about the right way to do

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,520
that what measurements you're interested

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,299
in seeing I'd be really happy to talk

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,410
about that as well and you know there's

00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:55,770
some other interest there at the bottom

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:57,870
so feel free to just say hi hi I'm Nina

00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,870
I've been working with the 11 from few

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:04,590
years now and I'm not all signing I

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:07,320
focus on TV Oh power demand management

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,230
and off till eight have been focusing on

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,470
streaming many of our drivers and many

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:16,590
of the changes that we may do for

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,110
production devices and so they're quite

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,090
a lot of hacks that we have done and

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:24,720
let's have bigger get many of these

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:28,309
hacks upstream so that's pretty much it

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,590
and I guess there are few are the

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:37,340
interests other than just work I like to

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:37,340
roll by and just talk about science

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:52,910
hi my name is Daniel base in France and

00:18:46,520 --> 00:19:01,309
tools so I city by where they threw the

00:18:52,910 --> 00:19:04,970
era a380 airbus plane so I'm lovely

00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:09,010
narrow employer since three years now I

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:13,490
began as soon as the Messiah from IBM

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:17,720
and I worked one year from IBM sayonara

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:20,570
and then I john'll in a row and I'm

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:26,000
working since two years as a as in our

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:32,030
own employee my experiences i'm doing

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:37,040
jen emergencies or s 10 years I began

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:40,700
with weaving upstream into Linux

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,830
containers knowledge inside cannon so it

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:49,340
was a big work and especially the little

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:54,500
park part now its discontent Arsenal da

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:59,630
Xing and little by little I involving

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:04,400
poor management and now I'm maintaining

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:08,600
the city other framework for arm mostly

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,940
the worker I don't last years was clean

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,540
up all the drivers and tragically finest

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:17,360
drivers for the same the same skin or

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:20,929
for all the these drivers and speak to

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:26,870
behave specific code and move this code

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:32,540
excited ouch directory and the just put

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:37,820
the back and driver more or less harsh

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:44,059
and specific and in order to to be able

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:47,059
to merge all these these drivers so that

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:48,400
reached the point where today we are

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:51,010
able

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:56,170
to define different either states with

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:59,940
the device tree and so we have now a

00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:06,280
generic driver we have just finished and

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:09,400
we are merging upstream beside that time

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:13,770
work on also maintaining the documents

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:18,390
so rock events the documents drivers and

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:24,850
drops of drivers are important because

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:27,040
there are sooo saga records for the

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,020
system that if they are not implemented

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,350
in the right way they can provide they

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,930
can lead to a lot of wake-ups persistent

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,810
so for destinations so it's interesting

00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:42,580
to have an iron and I am about something

00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:45,430
on these drivers my name jay i'm working

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:50,610
on the energy of our schedule and trying

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:55,570
to integrate the city other framework

00:21:50,610 --> 00:22:00,910
loading from the inside escaped the

00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:04,510
sugar so we can be more efficient and

00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:10,030
more smart when we choose the right

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:12,520
estate way we go and so the part of the

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:16,150
disintegration is already upstream is

00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:22,570
mostly cultural code reorganization and

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:28,380
and storing an information inside the

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:28,380
scheduler be accessible to elite freight

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:36,760
today i'm also working on the violence

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,370
investigating modern working on but

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,980
creating some kind of proof of concept

00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,999
we follow an eye or a dancing tracking

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:48,749
mechanisms of ideas to try two different

00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:53,369
Latin seas for the task port task so why

00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:55,109
does the sugar nose old is going to to

00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:56,729
switch the I don't ask because there is

00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:59,189
nothing left in the system because

00:22:56,729 --> 00:23:02,419
because someone task are blocked on

00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:07,979
diners we can win some everything's

00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:11,069
awesome kind of loads they use watching

00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:13,079
maybe the next the next event on the

00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:16,199
system based on value to wake up the

00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,339
city so we are we are more efficient in

00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:20,099
the decision you should be more

00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:23,099
efficient with the decision so later we

00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:28,019
are investigating that and why there is

00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:33,409
a prototype in the available at the

00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:37,169
jeans Gentry for the integration trio

00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:41,849
for the energyaware scheduler diverse

00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:45,689
country and also I like to maintain it

00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:47,639
is better to send some peanuts and if I

00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:52,739
identify the code across different such

00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:56,729
as 10 women what that's relevant so if

00:23:52,739 --> 00:24:01,199
you need sometimes on these areas City

00:23:56,729 --> 00:24:06,089
Idol or management some part of the

00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:08,909
 can ask me and I'm Troy I was

00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:12,989
strong experience for system programming

00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:14,669
user space so you need advices for

00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:19,619
example to develop an application in

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:24,769
user space to be less energy more energy

00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:24,769
efficient so you can process

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:40,760
hi my name is teaching when I assign it

00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:46,040
to the school and from the attack and I

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:50,030
live image into time well now I have

00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:55,820
some experiences working on blow the

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:59,810
driver protein PSP attendance and from

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:03,230
Adama I just join this girl send asylum

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:07,060
for less than two months so i am just

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:10,820
now doing something simple stuff like

00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:14,650
some others they're fixing and i'm now

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:22,630
also starting to do something in

00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:26,380
chemical confirm it and my chest is to

00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:30,890
transcend time testing is Colonel cotton

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:44,900
understandable how every subsystem work

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:51,470
with each other thank you whatever I'm

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:55,280
an accountant I'm a sweet guy I live in

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:58,610
a small town south of Sweden travel and

00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:02,000
there are only arrived are a coward 50

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:05,390
clinics to a small inner office that

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:14,000
include or am in love with the other in

00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:20,300
ro sweets so ya allah vanillin two small

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,020
kids account and you know raw and I've

00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:30,740
kind of Tupac's that I'm involved with

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:35,600
or maintaining MMC subsystem and well

00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:40,490
all all levels at the first comes with

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:43,040
maintaining subsystem especially

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:49,730
well I haven't contributed to the M&C

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:52,429
subsystem mr. Hall management ask so yes

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:57,650
that's why it seemed to this area as

00:26:52,429 --> 00:27:03,700
well and what I've been working on

00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:06,590
recently and the post of here is

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:10,280
something that I've called one time he

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:15,500
and employment or on something to

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:20,750
summarize it I think it's one of those

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:25,910
things that has been missing framework

00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:32,120
was in for a while for for for various

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:36,830
socks and I'm trying to do to find out

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:43,580
the missing pieces to make this work in

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:47,420
and I for complete so so that is also

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:51,230
related to how power makes stuff is

00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:53,360
being used that's what I'm doing so it's

00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,610
much more on our way or another public

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,160
side so I'm not that deeply involved

00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,730
with that like some other glasses how we

00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:09,140
kind of us getting this that's not mine

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:14,800
play it cup of tea not yet at least so

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:22,120
yeah a bit yeah Anna like the scheme of

00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:22,120
sports food here whatever okay

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,040
some when I'm working moment see how

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,440
Washington by occasionally visit the

00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:37,730
letter office beginning Kevin's tractor

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,500
shed I was over Villa Nardone and pretty

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,380
much windows on the side is like the

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,470
main work guy dude is testing related so

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,660
call me 10 or 15 create tests me working

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:50,390
on this month's monthly release very

00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,070
compact and then I also get a chance to

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,090
interact with other cheeks and see what

00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,280
they didn't try and learn from

00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:58,640
associated evolved into a teens yeah

00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:03,200
sure to lava geyser you know happy to

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,670
hear me long time and i'll be happy

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,130
going to talk to everyone about my

00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:09,530
experiences as a little Spurgeon

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:12,080
engineer only reaching my one-year mark

00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,430
this November actually and then then as

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,760
you did and I've been doing the last

00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:19,430
vacation so it's not something to do up

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:27,110
once in your lifetime and amended

00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:30,430
ordinance on matey's next yes hello my

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:35,000
name is another son is old I'll nothing

00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:38,740
in the power management okay look for is

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,060
my rubbish we can embrace it my friend

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:46,040
what I'm doing in the validity is mainly

00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:50,480
working under in a few we're in

00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:56,270
education scheduled for two years ago

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:59,780
and more generating or or alive in the

00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:04,190
camera maker but difference in the

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:08,960
parkin sections look at the World Trade

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:11,480
field coil for since beautiful but now

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:18,830
the stated I zamane mein is that we have

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:20,870
to stop so we working right now we work

00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,720
out of consideration for others you

00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,770
capacity in the scheduler and ordinary

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,300
on tracking

00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:34,730
an expected awake apparent that just

00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:37,880
weighs with energy on custom and for

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:45,140
that I may be using a trouble to get an

00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:47,690
inside Scott can talk to me about soil

00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:51,560
and skating a joke but no generic in the

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:54,140
agency in here improvement in the

00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,220
permanent kind of a gremlin MBT pleasant

00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:07,340
valley well played wet racing discuss

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:09,350
friend so that was the current of

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:12,950
arrangement in man what we'll be doing

00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:16,160
and these are the highlights for cars in

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:21,170
flight we working cartoon home so you've

00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:25,550
heard yes being married around many

00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:30,260
times now I think about five or six

00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:35,870
people on a dealer now on es aspects

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:39,170
years course Lane validation and we're

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:42,860
gonna round up a little bit but some

00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:46,510
changes on clock framework Mike and be

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:50,140
China would be working on this week

00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:55,190
Lena's right now working on improving

00:31:50,140 --> 00:32:00,920
mus framework person you correctly it's

00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:04,310
a global constraint yes this mission

00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:07,160
never the idea of creating a reference

00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:08,630
on an IBM of mutation so when IBM must

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:14,320
be in the kernel for a very long time

00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:16,880
but use it as well there may be an BSP

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,680
you want to try and change that by

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,900
creating a presentation stream so

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,470
there's more and more of our members and

00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,470
it is start converting

00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:33,630
and there are rules there's gonna be a

00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:38,140
bunch of work done around pudding or day

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:42,460
features so this is a snapshot of what

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:46,890
we as a team we're working on up

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:54,179
screaming in this point that's a link

00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:58,539
sorry that's a picture from the tall

00:32:54,179 --> 00:33:05,169
tall ships races that happens in both

00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:09,130
things across Estonia so we didn't think

00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:15,700
very gracious so we'll be sailing or

00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:22,360
both ever again so yeah that's really so

00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:26,280
do not wait a bit session behavior so

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:29,860
inclusive created I said idea try and

00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,780
figure out these problems then there is

00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,510
no jurisdiction on Thursday so that's

00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:37,150
all of all morning unversity three

00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:39,909
sessions where the engineers are going

00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:44,230
to be talking about why having an

00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:46,090
internal summit and then one of our

00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:50,320
members are you talking about their own

00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:52,840
ears and imitation and for the the

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,659
pitfalls they had to face there and

00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,360
finally our plan moving forward so it

00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:02,880
means Sun progress and enjoyed it if I

00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:05,049
were the next steps are in between this

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,589
we are also going to be doing a lot of

00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:10,599
hacking sessions in the afternoon where

00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:12,070
we are going to be trying to figure when

00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,399
you try to get out what the next steps

00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:18,250
are four years and then there's several

00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:23,379
other topics around I p.m. by forming a

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:25,899
movement for example if more people are

00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:29,020
losing the Chromebook at this point for

00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:30,919
it because it's available it's a

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,899
convenient support and

00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:35,299
seems to be the most musical platform if

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:38,829
you have a black heart as numbers that

00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:38,829
look like Tom that would be more useful

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,079
share with us please please come and

00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:47,329
done to us he's coming up to me and can

00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:53,329
see how we can work that into our

00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:57,319
destiny manager and that this point we

00:34:53,329 --> 00:35:01,569
feel that I mean I incision on once once

00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:04,130
the management bits are available and

00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:10,599
crumpled I think that those are aspects

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:13,609
to make progress on orange ostrich old

00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:16,160
yeah so there's no be several Santa a

00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:19,700
less alone to find us in the afternoons

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,500
so come down to us there is not much

00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,720
specifics and we are going to be happy

00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:30,829
once everything's be discussions around

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:34,700
here obviously around and into such he's

00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:36,980
coming on to us these are some of

00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,390
resources mentioned in this life so I

00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,740
should go to repeat you interested in

00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:46,069
some of those you've created have a low

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,309
there some Chinese something what we've

00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:55,250
done stream see if you're black home

00:35:49,309 --> 00:36:17,510
support that's about it from us any

00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:26,569
questions yeah you see use email should

00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:29,270
be introduced or so that's being

00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:34,690
spearheaded by a leg at this point I

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:38,390
mean CBC driver you guys are working on

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:40,910
we expect to be more than renewing

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,890
process I've talked one way about it and

00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,049
I think you should definitely be

00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:48,440
reviewing the code but because we don't

00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:53,740
have acts like forms at this point we

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,740
are not in development drinking excess

00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:05,119
excess amount of platforms has been a

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:11,500
challenge for us and so is that can be

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,500
fixed we can increase your anticipations

00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:25,430
Pacific noses so I guess I enjoy this

00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,319
down in the dryer and trying to figure

00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:29,390
out where we can actually provide most

00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:31,250
value I feel at this point are the most

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:35,390
value we can provide is actually viewing

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:39,470
all that work we have maintenance here

00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:41,450
for oils if we again so i think that's

00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:44,299
that's the best value we can handle this

00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:48,549
funk but if there's if there's more

00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:48,549
engagement needed we should have done

00:37:51,400 --> 00:38:01,730
some passive edges or depression um

00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:04,069
right there so you can download the

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:09,559
slides there so there's get fries

00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:14,510
Brendan actually I left out RT have our

00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:18,349
DM so we reduce an idea to create a work

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:24,059
load generator as well and so if you are

00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:26,470
interested in with that described next

00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:28,210
but be I should find a dealer in the

00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,150
similar in your rx which may be the same

00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:39,369
URL get you not a robot / power and not

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:42,940
/ idea the other ears are those must be

00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:47,589
conducive yes and the Sun I think a

00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:52,720
little hme so some kind of a working

00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:55,329
presentation here's an affinity used to

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,000
get it restored listen understand where

00:38:55,329 --> 00:39:02,290
youre involves what projects you working

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:10,240
towards features Martin are you going to

00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:12,940
cover that in brief understand yeah so

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:31,869
go to the EES workshop on Thursday thank

00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:35,410
you I'm not sure you have time you'd

00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:38,549
probably be mobile navigation various

00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:43,480
any like AC quadrilateral tendencies

00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:46,329
abstraction so over the emanation give

00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,339
not this question to remember what we've

00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,859
done is we've upstream to the core

00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:54,339
support for hibernation arm so

00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:59,369
everything around sitting on the pages

00:39:54,339 --> 00:40:01,960
and intervention on that what what

00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:05,049
individual associate vendors me to do

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,890
though is ad platform books so that's

00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:12,940
that's very Armada specific we haven't

00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:18,640
done that we tested the ocean on a TI

00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:20,410
Bigelow platform and it works there the

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,180
key requirements for hibernation what

00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,220
William glad for my first has suspended

00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:27,339
zoom working that's that's a key point

00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:30,220
and beyond that then you need some sort

00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:32,109
of support from your firmware

00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:34,480
when you're walking up to be able to

00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:40,810
restore from your image have an engine

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:42,609
image instead of doing a freshman so but

00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:47,380
all of this is actually very varied like

00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:50,230
from specific and so we are not planning

00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,790
to do any work around that doing a

00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,490
reference implementation at this point

00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:57,940
because it requires extensive knowledge

00:40:54,490 --> 00:41:06,580
of that comet requires all the drivers

00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:08,410
to support suspend resume but but we are

00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,450
willing to talk to you about how to go

00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:13,420
about doing and how to reach that point

00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:17,349
because we know how to get there it's

00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:20,650
just that we don't have the all the

00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:21,849
documentation available for the SOC to

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:34,630
actually go into a reference

00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:36,430
implementation so there I mean you go to

00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,980
have an ace you want to become as fast

00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:42,760
as possible right so to say something

00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:46,410
and resources like that what you say and

00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:49,839
then how do we score what else do you

00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:52,030
want to put up as fast as possible for

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,940
my ass with shortcuts are entities I

00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:57,750
don't know there's something there so

00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,790
you're looking over hibernation as a

00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:05,380
relative to fish Mooney so that you can

00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:10,960
do slow quickly whatever house passports

00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:21,970
you want as much as possible so how much

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:25,089
more say in association with pasta I'm

00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:28,589
sorry I get this question maybe I mean

00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:34,930
equation related going amazing without

00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:35,869
ssl in Jesus are the same you can wake

00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:39,769
up

00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:44,990
that is an honorable is this average in

00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:54,650
a lagoon custody so how can you wake up

00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:57,890
as in so we got source and we can only

00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:02,529
do yeah so that's our diocese in the

00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:06,170
front morning you're somewhere besides

00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:09,109
do whether you wanna move the cpu and

00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:11,230
refreshment or you want to this point to

00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:14,180
a imaginative store we're here

00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:15,799
hibernation image and so I think the

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,089
bigger moon was the only platform where

00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:19,579
we could actually get it to work

00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:23,150
correctly because the former hat right

00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:25,309
hooks in there we don't have enough

00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,640
information about other black folks be

00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:29,869
honest because it's always in the front

00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:34,940
can you do you know anything about other

00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:37,400
Blankenship have the support there's a

00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:41,619
lot of articles that claimed three

00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,619
products that seem to be probable using

00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:51,170
compound guys usually start at this

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:53,230
point they have fun the other thing I

00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,759
understand animals there's a lot of

00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:57,980
potentially for when your title fast

00:43:55,759 --> 00:44:02,150
wake up deciding whether it won't wake

00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:04,489
up fast right away because the gym core

00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:06,950
providing quotes for suspending resume

00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:10,880
you also get some additional motivation

00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:14,359
all three even you can choose to use

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,390
those rods used every army optimizations

00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:18,920
what I want to do for specific riders so

00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:22,819
there's a lot of hot almost Pacific

00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:28,279
optimization crickets you tellin what a

00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:31,160
reference that's very relevant so

00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:33,079
hibernation hello so I have intention of

00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,410
those things where a couple of members

00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:39,780
and asked us to do this work every year

00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:41,580
ago after that

00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:45,240
membership really expressed an interest

00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:49,230
in continuing this work and adding more

00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:52,380
features or anything if something like

00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:54,570
that is why then I expect you should go

00:44:52,380 --> 00:45:06,210
talk to the tsc and basically is this is

00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:09,330
a request with our altar for wherever

00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:12,870
screen you know this oughta be able to

00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:16,260
perform other channel are in spite of

00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:19,230
sushi rice are interfaced either we have

00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:22,740
generally find one of the partitions and

00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:25,890
the responsibility recycle c'mon suicide

00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:29,940
whole things off my car systems has been

00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:32,630
right up it's probably is here a king

00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:35,940
bit late to the party also determine put

00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:40,950
it right in America are those I look at

00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:43,050
it as a reference excited mention lots

00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:54,510
of help in with resistance would you

00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:57,510
know be able to implement emanation some

00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:02,160
of the base yellow here we are going to

00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:18,060
make sure actually exercise completely

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:19,590
throw it on you is it was possible so

00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,930
this is this question has been asked

00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:24,840
terrified bigger question contamination

00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:32,100
and having a implementation so if he can

00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:34,140
I join the y direction segmentation what

00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,300
you know or more supervise the trust

00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,980
remarkable and that is a reference

00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:42,900
implementation as a joke

00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:49,740
for fortune I not exactly included

00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:51,570
nation but it has a density of the other

00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,730
in order to make sure there is an

00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:58,109
implementation its best women and wife

00:46:53,730 --> 00:47:04,200
um have you guys actually done the work

00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:08,490
or glad or decorations in what 65-64 but

00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:10,320
all of us okay see something similar to

00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:26,000
what we did round until has to be done

00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:29,780
for example diverse so yeah actually

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:35,460
information to see the decision is God

00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:47,280
is it is not a member of SMERSH all of

00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:49,830
Education currently this has been even

00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,270
of interface credible story image just

00:47:49,830 --> 00:48:04,310
wanting able to follow us to the

00:47:53,270 --> 00:48:04,310
specific space versus my patients in the

00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:15,840
community I can't stay there for

00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:21,540
Funimation business and I'll estates

00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:24,210
pick up in church now premium rent so

00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,670
presumably relation snakes if you need

00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:35,850
to know it's an information of those i

00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:37,920
SPECT the spoilers it's okay see I was

00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:40,500
just calling adventure in the end is

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,790
very small app and in particular

00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:47,610
measure your platform in some magic max

00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:50,340
mutant I think initially reversal

00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:52,980
glances on happening but in reality the

00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,870
bringing of development virtual practice

00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,870
alone when some of the stuff is basic

00:48:54,870 --> 00:49:00,570
form of the age probably good

00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:03,720
opportunity to notice to pay some

00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:07,800
understanding in walls we don't yet have

00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:12,810
0 interface or be required for amination

00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:27,780
is being mortal I'm not sure Charles's

00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:29,250
around so it's called a total man it's

00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,100
certainly something I mean another the

00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:37,250
core support around 64 be something I'm

00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:41,360
not okay you guys are only doing the

00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:47,930
driver was MLB psci Oregon journals

00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:52,440
should be we have making public the

00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:55,440
condolence to trust a drummer so is not

00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,970
entirely just to know throwing young

00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,640
cannot pick up the world in general if

00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:05,100
you know doesn't they know how to

00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:14,460
english test at us so you're good

00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:20,220
application so so we don't use for the

00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:23,340
BCS baby who is a katana in playstation

00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:26,460
earth would be enlisted find out a

00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:28,590
little because idle state which is in

00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,210
the mind of his head you want to you

00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:32,910
want to look at this gentleman called

00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:36,570
Charles car seat open he's arriving

00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:39,750
tomorrow okay so you want to look out

00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:42,990
for Charles come to come to sang

00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:47,150
double-a and you'll find him there yes

00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:47,150
our in tomorrow

00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:56,660
you should definitely connect each other

00:50:52,910 --> 00:51:10,820
on that at least believed by the state's

00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:12,230
probably think they don't of thing so

00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,940
there's another interesting feature that

00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:16,370
I do interested in talking to anybody

00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,710
who's using it relatively recently an

00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:22,400
internal part of the PM or added up and

00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:24,890
features which was called but Bravo

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,900
validates and causes and idle and the

00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:30,110
code calls in ketosis freeze but the

00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,960
basic idea is used mostly suspend users

00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:36,830
wages and all the writers and then the

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:41,510
motivation is to us use remain active so

00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:44,030
it's essentially a it's a suspended all

00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:46,370
things in terms work but if any of you

00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:48,170
have by the interesting use cases or

00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:51,170
ideas for that it's not it's not clear

00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:54,950
whether users relatively recently had to

00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:56,990
the colonel anywho as I is what kind of

00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:00,650
hear your ideas about how you use that

00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:07,730
our ideas for faster way to Hook's or

00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:11,500
something that might have around every

00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,500
