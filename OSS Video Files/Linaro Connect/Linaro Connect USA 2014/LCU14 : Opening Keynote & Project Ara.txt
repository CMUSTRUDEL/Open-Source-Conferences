to be absolutely terrific and have a lot

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,740
of great content a lot of good meetings

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,170
a lot of good sessions catch up with one

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,820
another usually in years past we've only

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,830
had three months between connects so we

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,539
had six months since Macau so that's

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,010
given us extra time to make sure that

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:26,340
this is really going to be an amazing

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:28,140
week one of the things we're going to do

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,260
this morning is we're going to have a

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,300
very innovative keynote from our CEO

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,739
George Gray with support from a number

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,930
of people within linaro I think you'll

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,140
find it very interesting the other thing

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,120
is from time to time someone comes up

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,640
with an idea or a group of people come

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,760
up with an idea that's just so creative

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,930
and it captures everyone's imagination

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,730
and everyone thinks about it they go wow

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,610
that's really interesting that really

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,640
turns the world in some way on its side

00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:59,190
imagine if that took hold and actually

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,440
was used and was successful so we have

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,470
one of those ideas today it comes from

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,710
the google project google a top team

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,360
advanced technology and projects and

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,740
palermo eremenko is here this morning

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,260
and he's going to share with us insight

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,700
on what the google calls project ara i

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,680
think everyone will find that really

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:23,119
interesting there are a number of theme

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,200

week Tuesday is digital home day so

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,259
there'll be keynotes around digital home

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,549

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,470
this great Wi-Fi here Ben Copeland from

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,000
linaro is overseeing it if you have any

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,070
questions or issues but in general in

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,840
the last few days inn hotel from my

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,970
experience OFI has been really great

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,259
which is a strong contrast from some of

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,090
the pre some other previous clinics that

00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,460
we've had and the cross for in Silicon

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,590
Valley so it all works very well the

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,539
password is actually in your badge along

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,650
with naps and things like that so you

00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,270
can see the password in there if you

00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,979
brought a device to the last connected

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,720
Macau it's actually the same password so

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,570
like I showed up here yesterday and all

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,979
of a sudden my laptop and and and phone

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,960
they just connected because it was all

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,539
the same it's the same SSID same

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,820
password so that's all good so that's

00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:14,169
just a little bit of logistics so what

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,960
I'd like to ask you now is to please

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:26,349
join me in welcoming George Gray our CEO

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:30,099
for our opening keynote thanks very much

00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:31,780
Joe so welcome everybody I don't think

00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:35,710
I've ever had such a good turnout first

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,680
thing on Monday morning so I'm very

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,560
excited to see you all thank you all for

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,729
coming I think this is going to be our

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,580
best and biggest connect yet and just

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,580
remember that this is about

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,810
collaboration communication and

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,090
engineering we're going to do more

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,159
engineering this week than I think we've

00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,979
done in any previous connect we've got

00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:03,940
more space allocated for hacking we've

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:06,880
got more time allocated to open source

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,639
community sessions and having groups

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,229
working in there hacking rooms on on

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,550
everything they want to do this week so

00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:17,620
i think is going to be great so i just

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,389
wanted to look back a little bit for

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,830
those of you who don't know linaro is

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:26,380
now four years old we started in 2010 as

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,949
a member-driven software engineering

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:34,210
company dedicated to working on

00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:36,219
improving the open source community and

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,270
the open source technology for the arm

00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:40,810
ecosystem the initial members were armed

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,610
IBM

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,550
always supported open source and who

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,680
remain a community member to this day

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,970
and for SOC vendors originally from the

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,200
mobile space and on day 1 20 engineers

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:58,960
started in linaro on just two projects

00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,360
firstly the GCC toolchain which has now

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,300
turned into i think the dominant tool

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,490
chain that's used across the entire arm

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,380
industry and on Colonel consolidation

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,090
which over the following year led to the

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,280
adoption of device tree for the first

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,930
time to the ARM architecture which has

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,710
led to significant improvements across

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:25,120
the whole ecosystem and that was four

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:28,630
years ago so today were 28 members

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,139
including still arm and IBM there are 16

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,889
SOC vendors who are members of linaro 5

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:38,889
open-source companies and 5 end users

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:41,320
who are particularly driving their

00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,930
interest in leveraging the ARM

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,930
architecture into their products we have

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,840
over 200 open-source software engineers

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,900
working on the arm ecosystem round the

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,669
world and were the equivalent of a

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,100
fifty-million-dollar software company

00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:01,210
after only four years and growing

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,310
rapidly the company is formed into a

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,400
number of different structures overseen

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,890
by the technical steering committee who

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,410
control the work that we do and deliver

00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,660
requirements for core development in the

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,090
kernel and power management in security

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,880
and virtualization in the platform

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,490
engineering team and in the key product

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,200
technologies that we provide and over

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,900
the last couple of years we've moved

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,330
into working on open source in an

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,910
increasing number of segments as arm the

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,349
arm architecture and arm devices and the

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:36,280
rate of innovation you're seeing in the

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:38,680
arm ecosystem has moved on more into new

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,200
segments including the enterprise group

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,930
focusing on servers the digital home

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,910
group on set-top box digital TV the

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,010
mobil group working obviously in the

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,350
mobile space that's increasing itself

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:54,570
and the networking group focusing on

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,940
networking equipment so we're

00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:02,400
when we started four years ago we had

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:05,220
two projects today we're working on all

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,640
of these areas in the last six months we

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,800
have touched all of these projects and

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,840
made significant contributions to many

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,350
of these projects and that would not be

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,180
possible without not only linara his

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,860
engineers and assignees from all our

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,040
members but all of the other work that

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,370
that's led to through the community we

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,380
are having a significant impact on

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,870
improving open-source across the entire

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,780
ecosystem and it just would not be

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,550
possible without the initial idea that

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,040
led to linaro being formed and without

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,460
this collaborative engineering effort

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,080
that's happening between all of the

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,940
members and the community who are

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:51,930
investing in the efforts that we're

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:53,730
leading so thank you everybody um I want

00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,290
to touch on some of the key projects

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,540
that were working on over the next

00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,030
couple of years this is just the tip of

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,250
the iceberg but it's the visible tip

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:05,940
some of these projects are very visible

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:08,820
in the community and therefore define

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:14,820
some of the view that the market has of

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:18,390
linaro one is extensive changes that we

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,330
are working with other architectures and

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,510
the scheduler maintain errs to put into

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,610
the the mainline Linux scheduler to deal

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,430
with the future variety of not only our

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,460
mess Oh Sees but also other architecture

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,670
associes and this is about making the

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,430
scheduler more aware of what the

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,250
underlying topology of the hardware that

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,630
Linux is running on and ultimately it

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,220
doesn't matter whether it's a symmetric

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,590
multiprocessor whether it's an

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,750
architecture like big little or whether

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,970
it's actually starting to be completely

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,490
heterogeneous and use other forms of

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,610
processing this is going to be a big

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,250
issue and I have a big impact on all of

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,860
us over the next couple of years and

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,560
that work is well underway arm linaro

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,710
and our members are participating in it

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,430
and it's important that everybody

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,589
contributes to this

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,930
the open source community is about

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,330
working together no one solution is

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:19,350
necessarily right the process is working

00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:22,500
together to improve this technology for

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:26,010
everybody we're also clearly working a

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:32,690
lot on Android optimization particularly

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:36,270
around 64-bit associés OpenJDK we're a

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,910
group including Andrew Haley of Red Hat

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:43,320
and EDD Neville in linaro have made huge

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:45,930
steps in delivering a OpenJDK

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,630
implementation forearm v8 with full

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,750
enterprise c1 and c2 jets that are

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:54,000
showing extremely good performance and

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:58,800
have led to the delivery of not only

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,510
OpenJDK but also Java from Oracle I'm

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,459
also going to touch on open data plane

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,220
which is the defining project of the

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:09,630
networking group and on some work that

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:11,730
lhg is doing on security and creating a

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,070
fully open source implementation of

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,920
secure media playback which can then be

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:20,250
leveraged by multiple SOC vendors and of

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,110
course linaro also is putting increasing

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,910
focus on to the products that you're

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:31,950
using the tool chain itself the linaro

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:33,870
stable kernel and the larva continuous

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,910
integration and cloud test platform

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,890
that's a completely open source product

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,930
and starting to see wide adoption not

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:45,720
only in our members but also outside

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:49,170
linaro LNG is doing something really

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,950
interesting which is working on a

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:56,190
project called open data plane in 2013

00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:59,310
the lng members got together and said we

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:03,600
have to have a completely open source

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:05,490
cross-platform framework to create api's

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,520
for the data plane in networking

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:12,720
equipment already this team has

00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,420
delivered two versions and the first one

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,510
point 0 version will come out by the end

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,640
of this year our members are working

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,699
primarily on the ARM architecture within

00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,919
linaro

00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:26,619
but our members and others are already

00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:30,309
implementing this technology on arm on

00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:32,859
x86 using dpd k on the myths and the

00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:35,049
PowerPC architectures and this is an

00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:37,540
example of cross industry collaboration

00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:40,660
and is becoming recognized as an

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,819
increasingly important part of the

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,309
software-defined networking story and

00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:47,589
will become an underpinning of projects

00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:50,919
that are outside open collaborative

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,999
projects like open daylight so there's

00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,309
going to be a lot of discussion this

00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,989
week in the networking group and a lot

00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:58,720
of work going on to move this project

00:13:55,989 --> 00:14:01,689
forward but it's it's pretty exciting

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,089
and I'd particularly like to recognize

00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:05,949
Raj Murali who who is the director of

00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,829
the linaro networking group whose

00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:11,589
tirelessly working to make this happen

00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:16,540
with some of the end users who are

00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:18,699
actually in the networking group another

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,290
project that we've been working on hard

00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,540
over the last year that I'd like to

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,419
particularly call out is the open

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,709
portable trusted execution environment

00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:30,579
this is a full open source

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:33,759
implementation of a trusted execution

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:37,089
environment for arms trust zone and is

00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,709
now available today on github at that

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,529
that address you see at the bottom of

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:45,399
this slide it's open and available to

00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:48,279
all arm SOC vendors under a BSD license

00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,069
and participation and contributions are

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,689
welcomed from everybody we encourage you

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:55,589
to look at it one or two members who

00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:58,649
have looked at it have said it's a very

00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:01,629
full complete and impressively

00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:04,480
engineered piece of technology it comes

00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:08,230
out of a huge effort by st to

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,119
open-source this product which was

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,329
derived from work they originally did in

00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:16,239
there in the mobile world and they've

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:18,929
been working tirelessly with linares

00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:21,089
security group to help get this a

00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:24,009
project into the open source community

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:27,100
so a big thank you for st to making it

00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,379
happen and a lot of kudos to the linares

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,089
security group who've helped bring this

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:34,689
project into the open source community

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,230
and on that github site you'll find the

00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:38,050
client

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:43,420
the Linux drivers and then the actual

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:45,760
secure OS itself and please participate

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,830
in this project and contribute to it

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,830
whether you're a linaro member or not

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:57,520
the linaro stable k colonel a baseline

00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,160
for four member arm products we're

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,380
actually now in our second year of the

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,720
linaro stable colonel and this means

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,940
that the first version will over the

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,010
next few months depending on input from

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,290
the technical steering committee move

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,390
from having new functionality put into

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,400
it to more of a maintenance function

00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,410
over the next year and the focus will

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,570
move on to the next long-term supported

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,920
colonel from from kernel.org which is

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:26,260
314 the fact that 310 is used within

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,060
Android and AOSP at the moment means

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,790
that we may need to continue under the

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,320
direction of the tsc to add

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,390
functionality for a little bit longer

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,820
than we were originally expecting but

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,590
that's a sign of our success because it

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,390
means that our members care about it and

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,050
they're using it and we encourage you

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:46,210
all to continue to do that there are

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,640
also versions of the stable kernel for

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,560
the segment groups so there's a version

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,270
for Android for the mobile grouper

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,120
version with the real-time hatch set for

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:59,200
the networking group and a version

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,020
packaged for the IDK that is used as the

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,700
underpinning the the kernel is used as

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:09,460
the underpinning of the RDK for the

00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:11,320
digital home group for the first time in

00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:15,850
connect history we're going to do some

00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:18,520
live demos on stage unfortunately one of

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,680
the demos a key piece of hardware

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,150
required for the demo is actually stuck

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,170
somewhere in San Jose and we're not

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:29,520
quite sure where but the fact that the

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:32,950
missing piece is a piece of 4k hardware

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,680
and that we cannot do the demo on a low

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,650
resolution monitor is actually I think

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,320
really interesting is really interesting

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,030
sign and I can assure you you are going

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,940
to see or I am assured you're going to

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:48,280
see this demonstration later in the week

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,910
during the various demonstrations that

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,960
LH

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,470
you're going to do and we're going to

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,210
have on the demonstration day on friday

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,270
i'm going to ask mark Rogalski who's the

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,980
director of the linaro digital home

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,150
group to come up and talk a little bit

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:10,390
about what he's going to demonstrate

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:13,480
later this week mark all right thanks

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:16,240
George morning everyone unfortunately

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,950
had a bit of a snafu with a component as

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,950
George mentioned not available for our

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,600
live demo but we have a whole host of

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,680
demos that are going to be available on

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,560
friday during the demo friday session we

00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:33,190
have three member boards we have four

00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:35,560
separate demos i just wanted to just

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,940
take a step back real quickly remind

00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,070
everyone that lhd was officially

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,830
launched in May of this year and since

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:44,380
that time of the members have been

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:48,160
collaborating together under several

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,650
initiatives and so most of the focus

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,560
right now has been on the linux-based

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:58,090
RDK and this is the foundation for the

00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,160
arm SOC work on digital set-top boxes so

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,260
LHC has implemented changes to the

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,970
streaming framework architecture as well

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,210
as innovations to the web rendering

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,680
engine and as well as abstractions of

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,450
the graphics layer so we've got a lot of

00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,340
work in the chromium embedded framework

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,290
area a lot of work in the gstreamer

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,760
openmax integration a lot of work in

00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,380
various other areas in western

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,480
compositor over the wayland windowing

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,650
protocol so these are the kinds of

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,570
things that we're going to see on friday

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,880
so one of them the demo we were hoping

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,910
to have today but will have later in the

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,900
week was on a member hardware board the

00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:41,350
stmicro logic micro electronics be 21 20

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:44,770
board it's 4k graphics with 1080p video

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:49,240
showing shown simultaneously it's based

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:52,450
on a set top platform which is a dual

00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:57,010
core arm cortex a9 with a graphics

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:59,950
processing unit of a quad-core mali-400

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,380
all of the work we do in LH g is based

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,990
on the Vanara stable colonel where

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,300
currently at version 3 10 all of the

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,370
builds that we do are open invaded yocto

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,830
we're on the Daisy branch at this point

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:14,350
and as I mentioned we are moving from

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,150
the x11 windowing system we're looking

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,250
at egl we're looking at the west and

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,070
compositor over the railing windowing

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,170
system so that that's one of the demos

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:27,070
as well as a host of others on chrome

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:33,010
embedded framework and integrations of

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:35,590
open max with gstreamer so again oh I

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,440
think I've jumped ahead reminder

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,270
everyone friday lhg demo day there's a

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:50,080
lot to see him look forward to seeing it

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:52,360
there thank you thanks for much mark I'd

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,060
like now like to introduce Tom ghoul

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,770
who's the director of the linaro mobil

00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,970
group and Tom's going to talk a little

00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:06,700
bit about what he's going to show you

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:10,120
today on our mobile group I am

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:14,650
particularly excited to demonstrate to

00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:18,520
you today android on arm v8 on the juno

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:20,530
development platform this is a really

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,570
exciting thing to show if you've been

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,960
watching the linaro website ever since

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,080
june since june july august you'll

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,620
notice that linara has made available

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:36,400
reference builds of android for juno and

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,320
so today we we actually have a juno

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,960
board we have to I definitely must

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,270
extend my deepest appreciations to arm

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,620
for hand carrying one of their Juno

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,990
board so that we could have this demo

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,700
and as you might say Elvis is in the

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,780
building and he's happens to be in the

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,760
back so what do we have here well we

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:59,110
have Android and in this case it's

00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,490
android running with the AOSP master so

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,800
this is something that if you did a repo

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,470
sync of the Android tip you'd have the

00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,690
exact same source code we are running

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,990
with the linaro stable based kernel

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:13,660
version 3 point n we have Molly support

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,090
so we have accelerated 3d graphics we

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,210
are using the trusted

00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:23,520
more so it's UEFI and all of this was

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:26,670
built with linares 4.9 GCC so now I'd

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,160
like to introduce kazeem Mohammed booth

00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,920
courses the lmg tech lead and he's

00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,410
standing in the back to do the demo so

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,210
kazeem take it away you don't have them

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,620
there you go ahead and keep watching

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:43,320
here because it's on the screen right

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:46,080
here I am very happy and excited to have

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,420
this demo room for you so good morning

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,480
everyone first of all and welcome to

00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,640
Lenore Oh connect so i have this

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,360
hardware from arm this is the juno

00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,960
platform for obviate having arm cortex

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,710
a57 and a 53 with Molly integrated so i

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,770
have connected hdmi and there is a good

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:10,530
panel that you on brought for this demo

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,900
specially so i have android already

00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,470
booted on this platform so you can see

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:24,030
here and just for this demo i am going

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:30,390
to reboot this platform so this device

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:31,770
is going for reboot okay well this is

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,410

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,130
together this is a really great product

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,630
on having arm v8 running Android so a

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,980
round of applause for these guys please

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,230
so they are going to change the way

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,690
android mobile is going to be

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,220
[Applause]

00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,930
well this is still booting so there are

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,270
few lmg sessions that we are running

00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,180
today and across the week so there are

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,100
lot of arm v8 the sessions that we are

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,340
running there is engineering team from

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:31,010
arm and leaner off work at various

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,930
sessions and also at hiking sessions so

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,470
please use this opportunity to connect

00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,060
with them and like please attend the

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,530
sessions and please don't forget to

00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,870
attend one of the important sessions

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:45,440
today on building this AOSP community

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:51,230
around arm v8 android so it's today in

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,420
the noon let me see if this works so i

00:24:51,230 --> 00:25:00,380
just happened to find one of my favorite

00:24:53,420 --> 00:25:06,950
demos so anybody is interested in

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:15,400
playing let me see if i can hit it in

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:15,400
the one shot yes I did so thank you

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:27,380
thank you very much chasm George like a

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,150
theme definitely room for optimization

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,160
there I think we need to get that boot

00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:39,610
time sped up a bit so lmg is doing great

00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:42,680
work and our relationship with Google is

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:44,780
strengthening we've done ought to work

00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,640
with Google as some of you know there

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,060
was a blog posting recently about work

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,740
we've been doing with qemu that's helped

00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,350
Google enormously in terms of delivering

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:59,660
the sdk for android and we're continuing

00:25:54,350 --> 00:26:02,000
to support them and that work so moving

00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:06,530
on we have one further demonstration

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,300
that my clicker stop clicking which is

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:13,070
from le g and so i'd like to invite the

00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,140
director of the linaro enterprise group

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:18,380
working on the arm server ecosystem

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:22,140
andrea gallo to show you what he's got

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:25,800
to demonstrate thanks Andrew

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:29,490
George our them is running on three

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,370
nodes 1 node is the master is the cloud

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:35,250
master is running OpenStack and is

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,700
running the J cloud plugin with Jenkins

00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:40,710
and it's deploying java test regression

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,870
test the jet rag on the other two notes

00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,820
so that we can run multiple java tests

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,520
in parallel the interesting thing is

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,690
that all this is running on arm 64-bit

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,090
machines and it's if you think about it

00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:58,440
we're running java tests on arm so we're

00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:00,840
using the open jdk 8 digit and jenkins

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,030
itself is based on java so we are

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,760
running again java on the controller

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,860
node and this is running OpenStack so

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,480
this demo is integrating together all

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,830
the technologies that we have been

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,520
working on for the last two years

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,890
openjdk OpenStack and it's showing the

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,780
collaboration amongst in our members and

00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,630
the collaboration with Reddit and

00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,330
canonical OpenJDK is a key project in

00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:28,050
cooperation with Reddit and OpenStack

00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:32,420
has seen incredible progress thanks to

00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,420
the collaboration with HP and canonical

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,890
the board the demo is running on three

00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:41,850
applied micro mustang boards they are

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:44,640
running ubuntu trustee and i will hand

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:48,650
over now to ender mcdermid technical

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,650
leader for our of architecture work

00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,500
yes

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,480
so as Andrew mentioned there are three

00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,960
Mustang boards on the desk here the

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,260
first one is the Jenkins master and you

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,730
can see here the dashboard what I've

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,630
done for the demo is I've created a

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:41,240
subset of the jpg test that we run on a

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:44,000
daily basis there are approximately

00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,090
18,000 tests in jtree eggs so we're not

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,590
going to run all of those here but you

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,400
can see that we have this matrix which

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:54,530
is really convenient I was part of the

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,150
build that we do for openjdk we build

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:01,520
both the server and the client compilers

00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:03,290
and in the openjdk tree there is the hot

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,780
spot lang tools and JDK regression

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,460
sweets so we have this matrix which

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,980
spans out nicely that we can spin up

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,610
each of the configurations on a separate

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:15,380
note for the demo I've been running this

00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,890
in a loop so you can see that every five

00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:21,230
minutes and this has been started it's

00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,610
not running at the moment and but if we

00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:27,380
catch the time right in a few minutes

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:32,930
maybe it will do if we go back to the

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:35,030
dashboard so we can see down the left

00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,210
hand side here that there's the master

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:40,580
node and this is running openjdk eight

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:44,420
and then on each of these images which

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:48,200
are virtual machines spawned by the

00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,090
Jacobs blood into opens back they have a

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,110
version of openjdk eight as well so

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:54,280
throughout this we're actually using

00:29:51,110 --> 00:30:01,720
openjdk ate as much as possible for

00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,720
dogfooding if you like if we look at the

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,900
the OpenStack dashboard we can see here

00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,610
that the other ticket ball is on the

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,430
desk here on Mustang go to and Mustang

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:13,760
go three and we've actually provisioned

00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,620
those as OpenStack compute nodes and if

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:21,560
we look at the overall project you can

00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:23,090
see that we've timed out we can see that

00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,550
we're using some of the CPUs available

00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,350
from these two other boards and if you

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,120
look a little bit further down we can

00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:32,210
see that these are the images which have

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,700
been spawned by Jenkins to get the work

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:36,870
done for the jpeg tests one of

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:42,330
thing I wanted to point out is that

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:44,399
we've been running openjdk age and a

00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:46,649
Jenkins master in the indicator lab for

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,370
about six months now and the test that

00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:52,409
we do are pushed from an arm server and

00:30:50,370 --> 00:31:00,860
you can see the results here on openjdk

00:30:52,409 --> 00:31:00,860
gotten our overall okay

00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,950
we want to know more about armed service

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:24,730
please join us on wednesday at the

00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:34,150
server ecosystem day thank you thanks

00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:36,310
very much Andre okay so that was our

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:38,320
first live demos we got through two out

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,560
of three of them so that's not bad well

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,770
done everybody so I just wanted to touch

00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,750
a little bit on a couple of industry

00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,120
trends and talk a little bit about some

00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:53,020
of the things that are happening over

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,700
the next if we expect 12 months it's

00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:58,050
pretty obvious that the ARM architecture

00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,730
is really starting to extend into

00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,710
segments other than mobile ranging from

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,200
IOT at one end of the scale all the way

00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,120
up to high-end servers and and this is

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,340
really driven by something I talked

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,530
about before which is the accelerating

00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,320
rate of innovation within the arm

00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,820
partnership there are more and more

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,620
devices coming there's more and more

00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,930
differentiation and innovation and

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,000
that's what draws end customers to the

00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,520
ARM architecture because they're faced

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,220
with more choice than ever before and

00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,530
therefore ultimately lower costs to live

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,990
deliver more performance but this also

00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:35,890
presents huge software challenges to us

00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:39,400
all the soc complexity and the speed of

00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:41,760
innovation is placing increasing demands

00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:45,280
on the delivery of standardized software

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,010
that will work across multiple s OCS and

00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,980
one of the really interesting trends is

00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:54,000
that the distributions themselves and

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:57,160
end customers are starting to recognize

00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,820
that successful open source software

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:04,000
depends on SOC support in the upstream

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,770
kernel and other project and and if you

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,790
look at some of the projects like the

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,600
chrome project obviously the server

00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:14,500
ecosystem because this is where it's

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:17,830
come from a demanding and requiring SOC

00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,920
vendors to have upstream support for

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,740
there for there s OCS and increasingly

00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,950
if you don't work

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,740
upstream which historically many of the

00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:31,020
mobile vendors haven't needed to do you

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,620
become uncompetitive for certain

00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,420
projects and I see that trend increasing

00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:40,200
and accelerating over the next year or

00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,940
two we're working with a lot of the open

00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,080
source projects from an operating system

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,480
and a distribution point of view

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,270
obviously with the Linux Foundation and

00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,270
with with the Yocto project we've been

00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:53,240
using that not only in LH g but we're

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,330
also using it in the networking group

00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:00,050
we're starting to engage with the chrome

00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:02,790
project and doing work on chrome and

00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:06,450
google at google i/o this year announced

00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:09,060
that they're bringing out three versions

00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:11,250
of android in the next release in

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,260
addition to the standard mobile version

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,260
so Android wear Android TV and Android

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,300
Android auto and I think that's going to

00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,730
significantly affect the segment groups

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,280
and the work that they do to embrace

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,149
this new platform and finally of course

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:31,260
in the in the server space we have

00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:33,600
ubuntu fedora Red Hat and in the

00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,609
networking group companies like NE a--

00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,310
who are working on distributions and

00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:42,179
software upstream for the networking

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:44,300
equipment marketplace and a feature of

00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,820
this is that collaboration is everywhere

00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,740
right linaro is working in the arm

00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,310
ecosystem but is now increasingly

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:54,629
working in other ecosystems as well

00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,940
there are two real categories one is

00:34:54,629 --> 00:35:00,900
where we do most of our work is in the

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,760
soc dependent a project so things like

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,060
the kernel itself and the associated

00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,970
projects things like AOSP for android

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:11,960
openjdk for java but we're also seeing

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:15,330
increasing interest in our members in

00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,520
demonstrating and optimizing other major

00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:20,700
industry projects that we're starting to

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,180
affect and these are built with the same

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,680
collaborative open-source software model

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:29,220
typically their architecture independent

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,440
but there are huge opportunities to

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,990
optimize some of these projects for the

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,270
ARM architecture and that's something

00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,700
our members are very interested in doing

00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,950
that we will continue to work with you

00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,450
on working out which projects are most

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:46,800
important and where linaro should

00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:50,970
contribute and be a part of part of this

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,190
clearly is linaro itself is not only

00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:56,670
acting as collaboration for the for the

00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:59,730
arm ecosystem but is also acting in the

00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,560
wider open source community and I'm very

00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:04,170
pleased that since we last got together

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,350
we have become formerly a silver member

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:10,380
of the Linux Foundation not on behalf of

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:13,470
our members but as linaro because as

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,120
linaro we are together with all of the

00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:18,090
members who are also members of the

00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,250
Linux Foundation increasing the amount

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,690
of influence and activity that were

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,230
generating around the ARM architecture

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:27,090
in the open source community and I'd

00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:30,810
particularly like to congratulate grant

00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:33,260
likely whose stand up grant who's in the

00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:38,540
front row here he was recently elected

00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:40,620
[Applause]

00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,420
recently elected as the chair of the

00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,730
Linux Foundation technical advisory

00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,730
board and will represent the tab on the

00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,290
Linux Foundation Board of Directors

00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,620
grant has worked tirelessly as many of

00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:54,570
you know in the office of the CTO

00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,250
particularly on boot architecture and

00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,440
I'm very very pleased for him that all

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:03,090
his efforts have been recognized by his

00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:06,690
peers so congratulations grant we today

00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:09,690
also welcome the Linux Foundation as a

00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:12,420
linaro community member alongside IBM

00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:15,360
and and we believe that there are a lot

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,040
of common threads between the Linux

00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,020
Foundation does and what linaro is a

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,000
software engineering organization does

00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,350
and we expect to see increasing

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,520
collaboration between the two

00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:29,250
organizations we also ourselves are

00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,780
expecting to continue to grow reflecting

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,240
the importance of open-source software

00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,670
in the industry in which will work and

00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,700
and our members are going to come not

00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:41,640
only from the soc vendor space but also

00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,200
from increased we think membership from

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,540
distributions in key open source

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,770
software providers and from end users so

00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,200
I'm now going to do something that we

00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,960
haven't done

00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,970
before which is we're going to talk a

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,560
little bit about some things that we're

00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:00,250
not going to share today

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,250
[Music]

00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:20,990
[Music]

00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:24,650
trailers in the movie theatre one of the

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:28,190
things we're working on is a server

00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:32,109
cluster based on arm v8 architecture

00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:34,760
hardware to accelerate the ability for

00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:37,309
ISVs to deliver deployment ready

00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,280
software to the answer for another

00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:42,230
enterprise markets so what we want to do

00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,920
is help the open source community

00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:49,369
operating system vendors and ISVs work

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:53,210
together on pre publicly available

00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:57,079
hardware from our members to be able to

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:59,630
test and validate and benchmark their

00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,630
software running on early access

00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:04,190
hardware so linaro is not going into the

00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,869
cloud business we're not they're going

00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,960
to compete with Amazon but what we want

00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:11,599
to do is enable software developers

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:14,180
particularly ISVs to get early access to

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,420
unannounced hardware we're initially

00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:20,599
doing this with applied micro and with

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:23,240
arm and we're deploying a cluster of

00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:28,400
servers that will be available on a by

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:30,559
request basis to SDK are two independent

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,619
software vendors who want to validate

00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:36,770
and test on arm hardware I also expect

00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:39,440
other members to add their hardware to

00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:42,500
this facility providing a one-stop place

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,510
where is be vendors can run their

00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,490
software and verify that it works across

00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:49,190
multiple linaro member hardware

00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:51,970
platforms and we welcome participation

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:54,859
by any linaro member into this

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:58,430
deployment facility you do need to

00:39:54,859 --> 00:40:01,160
provide us actual real one you're more

00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:03,160
you servers that we can put in racks and

00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,780
not just development boards this is for

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,450
devices that are ready to deploy that

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,970
unnecessarily available publicly yet and

00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:13,040
it will give software developers a heads

00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,359
up on an advantage on being able to

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,750
validate that their software works

00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:18,460
before you actually ship publicly works

00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:23,830
cross plan

00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:27,040
for the second initiative is the linaro

00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:29,859
community board program one of the

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,190
things that linaro wants to do is help

00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:36,010
get hardware earlier into developer

00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:37,900
hands it's been very frustrating in some

00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:42,010
ways that linaro engineers have not all

00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:43,960
got arm v8 platforms on their desks we

00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,089
do have a number of junos but as most of

00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,580
you know their their big development

00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:50,440
boards like many SOC vendors use for

00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:53,140
bring up of their own s Oh Sees and

00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,320
they're not really suitable for widely

00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:59,080
seeding across a big software community

00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:01,420
more hardware would help us and so what

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,150
linaro is doing about this is we're

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,000
going to be working with our members to

00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:10,210
create a community or oriented website

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,400
to encourage software developers from

00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,890
the community to work with linaro on

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,910
optimization of software particularly

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:22,510
for armed v8 by next connect my goal is

00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:24,490
to get at least one low cost arm v8

00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:27,760
board and preferably more than one on

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:29,920
every linaro engineers desk a not only

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,010
linaro engineer every arm software

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,540
engineers desk everybody should have on

00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:40,570
v8 hardware by next connect and this

00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:43,210
will help also drive work that John Mad

00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:46,599
Dog Hall has been doing over the last 12

00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,670
months in preparing for engagement on a

00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,450
much wider basis with global

00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:56,170
universities to put programs in place to

00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:59,460
help them have a platform for getting

00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:03,310
access to low-cost hardware and

00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:05,230
optimizing software specifically for arm

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,900
v8 we think this is a really exciting

00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:11,440
project we're looking forward to getting

00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:13,710
this hardware into not only our hands

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,080
but also to all of our members hands

00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:19,359
this is a work in progress we're not

00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,619
ready to talk completely publicly about

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,720
it other than the fact that I'm already

00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:24,820
talking publicly about it but if you

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,740
want more information please come and

00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,380
talk to me or one of the other linaro

00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:32,120
executive team the

00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,530
project that we're working on was

00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:40,340
referred to by Joe earlier I'm delighted

00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:43,580
that we have Paul Eremenko who is the

00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:46,610
head of project ara at Google a tap here

00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:50,630
to talk to us about this innovative

00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:52,850
disruptive and really fascinating

00:42:50,630 --> 00:43:13,000
project to work on so please welcome

00:42:52,850 --> 00:43:13,000
Paul Eremenko from google good morning

00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:22,700
what if we were to ask better questions

00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,850
of our phones like what if a phone could

00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:28,820
see in the dark or what if a phone could

00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,710
test if water is clean what if you could

00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,590
share the best parts of your phone with

00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:36,550
your friends with your family or perhaps

00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:41,000
not in the Bay Area but with a village

00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:45,380
what if I phone could so we think that a

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,220
phone should and so project ara is about

00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:51,110
opening the mobile hardware ecosystem

00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,090
it's about making the creation of mobile

00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,670
hardware more like the creation of

00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:58,010
mobile apps by lowering the barrier to

00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:00,530
entry by increasing the number of

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:03,020
participants in the ecosystem by

00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,880
enabling developers to sell directly to

00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,250
the consumer rather than having to go

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,160
through an OEM and by giving developers

00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,920
new hardware design tools that are free

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,910
and that make hardware design more like

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:20,330
software development now in addition to

00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:27,080
the what questions we also wanted to ask

00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:29,180
why why do it why does it matter and so

00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,870
I find this photo to be a particularly

00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:35,150
poignant reminder it's titled signal

00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,680
it's by johnston Meyer from National

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,750
Geographic and it depicts migrant

00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,520
workers in Djibouti trying to catch a

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,000
cell phone signal from neighboring

00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,630
Somalia and i think it's a it's a stark

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,640
reminder

00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:49,070
the fact that yes there is 1.5 billion

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,620
smartphones out in the world but there

00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,630
are also six billion people who are not

00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,460
connected to the mobile internet and

00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,970
delivering the mobile Internet to those

00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,710
people could in fact be world-changing

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:05,060
so we asked ourselves how would we do

00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:06,580
that what would it take to deliver the

00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,020
mobile Internet to the next five billion

00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,170
now a single device this is almost

00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:15,020
impossible to do with a single device

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:19,550
there's a diversity of once needs likes

00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:21,380
and budgets that's insurmountable so we

00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,110
look for inspiration from other

00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,310
industries first we looked at automotive

00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:26,950
of course in the early days of

00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:29,600
automotive there is the infamous

00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:31,070
infamous Henry Ford quote that says that

00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,620
you can have it in any color so long as

00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:36,200
it's black it's good enough for everyone

00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:39,440
but as the industry matured a power user

00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,030
base emerged that took customization to

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,550
all sorts of extremes and what's

00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:46,910
depicted there is the Local Motors rally

00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:49,870
fighter which is a community design and

00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:54,320
community built community built vehicle

00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:56,840
now a modern mass market car today has

00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,060
about thirty percent of its value that's

00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,650
tied up and user customizable options so

00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,690
these are both functional options like

00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:06,230
engine size as well as aesthetic choices

00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:08,420
like upholstery and exterior it wasn't

00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,400
so long ago maybe a year or two ago that

00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,200
when you bought a new smartphone your

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,090
choice was pretty much the same as the

00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,090
early Ford Model T would you like it in

00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:21,200
black which like it in white so last

00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:23,750
summer summer 2013 we undertook a

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,300
project to create an open hackable pump

00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,610
we were Motorola at the time there's

00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,950
called the moto maker phone we basically

00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:33,230
attached an Arduino board we unlock

00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:35,810
rooted the phone and pinned out some of

00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:37,550
the data buses to the Arduino got in a

00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:41,150
truck and went around the United States

00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:44,660
visited 12 universities Maker Faires and

00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:46,820
held maketh ons so 48 hour format and

00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,470
had some of the best and brightest

00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,380
design and engineering students in the

00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:53,450
country see what they could do with open

00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,220
mobile hardware and the diversity of

00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:57,410
things that emerged was really an

00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,250
exciting proof point for us we saw

00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:01,490
things like

00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:04,210
a glove that could interpret ASL and

00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:07,430
convert it into text messages we saw

00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:09,170
students using a phone and the gyro and

00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,420
accelerometer sensor suite in the phone

00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,710
attached to a skateboard to monitor the

00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,780
quality of the terrain that the

00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,460
skateboard is traversing and share that

00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,370
with other skateboarders in the area via

00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,620
google maps we saw an optometric

00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:23,510
examination sweet as a module that

00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:27,530
attached to your phone and did a series

00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:29,830
of series of exams for your eyes so to

00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:31,880
us that was uh that was really a

00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:34,910
demonstration and an eye-opening

00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,980
experience of the kinds of the kinds of

00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:39,740
things that emerged if you create an

00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:42,770
open ecosystem so we wanted to do better

00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:46,730
than cards we wanted to create a modular

00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:48,380
platform around mobile and in order to

00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,870
do that we felt that it would be useful

00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:53,930
to look at some examples from history of

00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:56,300
successful platforms I personally am an

00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,850
aerospace engineer so i'm partial to to

00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,340
the example of the b-52 stratofortress

00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,660
which is a strategic bomber that entered

00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:06,110
service with the US Air Force in the

00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:08,480
1950s remarkably the b-52 is not only

00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,860
still in operation but is estimated to

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,430
serve with the United States Air Force

00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:15,020
for another 20 to 25 years now by the

00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,540
time this airplane retires there will

00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,640
not be a single component from ribbit to

00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,150
integrated circuit that was there in the

00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,260
original 1955 aircraft yet

00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:27,140
morphologically it will still be

00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:29,000
recognizably a b-52 the different pieces

00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,740
of the aircraft will have gone through

00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,990
varying number of generations of changes

00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,060
one or two generations on the structural

00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,980
side and five six seven eight

00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,480
generations on the on the battle

00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:42,770
management system and the electronics

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,890
yet it retains the overall recognizable

00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:47,540
feature of being a b-52 and being a

00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:51,530
remarkably flexible and upgradable

00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:54,640
platform now a closer to to the mobile

00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:58,370
space perhaps is the IBM system/360

00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,020
introduced in the mid-1960s a typical

00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:01,730
core configuration was about a hundred

00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,790
thousand dollars in venir dollars a

00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:06,200
typical installed configuration also in

00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:12,310
the near dollars was about five and a

00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:14,960
half million what allowed for this 50

00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:18,200
increase in size of the peripheral

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,420
ecosystem visa be the actual system core

00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:24,440
and what allowed it was the fact that it

00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:26,360
was the first open modular platform now

00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,400
you might argue that in mobile why we

00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,110
have modularity today there's a USB port

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,150
there's an audio jack there's bluetooth

00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,410
there's Wi-Fi I can address all sorts of

00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,890
modules to my phone and there are some

00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:39,230
in fact some examples out there the the

00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:41,840
big credit the square credit card reader

00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:44,810
there are chargers their headsets and

00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,840
other sorts of things yet the size of

00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:49,910
the of the modular peripheral so to

00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,970
speak ecosystem around smartphones today

00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:54,590
is about seven percent of the overall

00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:57,200
smartphone market now compare that to

00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:59,240
the 50x that was realized for the IBM

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,790
system/360 and so you might ask yourself

00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,800
well why is that well what is it about

00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:07,550
that that that that makes it kind of

00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:10,340
anemic and the hypothesis that I'd like

00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:12,410
to proper for you is that unlike the IBM

00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:16,250
system/360 and perhaps more like the

00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:18,740
b-52 example the phone is a physically

00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,780
constraint if the actual exterior of the

00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:22,250
phone is a heavily physically

00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,960
constrained object and what you have

00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,240
today is this Christmas tree of stata

00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,730
that hangs off of your phone that

00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,380
attaches be a variety of wires and if

00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,870
it's wireless then it has a power

00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:37,120
charging tail that you have to drag

00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:40,070
behind it so it is not a integrated

00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,890
monolithic whole and I use the word

00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:45,680
monolithic specifically in reference to

00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:48,680
modular design in sort of in stark

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,930
juxtaposition to it so we asked

00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,960
ourselves the question could you make a

00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:57,080
modular device that is both delightful

00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,520
but is also expressive of users

00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,050
functional preferences and of their

00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:04,130
aesthetic preferences because those

00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:06,020
preferences are so diverse and so we

00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,360
also set ourselves quantitative target

00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:10,840
with respect to each goal and in the

00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:13,250
case of this particular goal we wanted

00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,920
we wanted to try and attain an order of

00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:18,710
magnitude increase in the subjective

00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,510
user perceived value of the device from

00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:22,070
the customization features from the

00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,750
functional and aesthetic customization

00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,100
features that you could get for making

00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:28,010
it modular

00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:31,310
we also wanted to make it affordable yet

00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:32,960
aspirational affordable means that it is

00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:35,750
accessible to the feature phone

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,250
crossover price point so that translates

00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,870
to a bill of material costs than the

00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,340
fifty two hundred dollar age not

00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:43,550
necessarily price but at least bill of

00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:47,180
materials costs yet we also wanted to

00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:49,070
make it aspirational we wanted users to

00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,320
aspire to a phone that might be a

00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:54,080
thousand-dollar device that might have

00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:57,130
an extraordinary camera a high

00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:59,690
resolution display personal medical bag

00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:01,070
Gnostic things so we wanted to be able

00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,620
to configure an order of magnitude

00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:06,560
variance in bill of materials cost off

00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,120
of the same platform I mentioned that we

00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,280
also wanted to make hardware development

00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,380
more like software development and the

00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,210
metrics associated with that are that we

00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,850
wanted to have hundreds of developers

00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:18,830
ultimately we aspire to a developer

00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:21,470
ecosystem around ara that rivals the

00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:24,080
Android app developer ecosystem but will

00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:25,970
settle for a couple hundred for now we

00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,370
also wanted to give developers a new set

00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,050
of tools that would allow them to create

00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,330
a module that in essence is correct by

00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:35,090
design so that there is only one build

00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:37,820
spiral required in essence this is

00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:39,950
similar to what vlsi design has come to

00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,570
in recent years where the first chip out

00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:44,180
of the foundry is usually prepped by

00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,860
construction instead of having four to

00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:49,520
five build spirals as is typical in

00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:51,920
mobile today and lastly we wanted to

00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,740
exploit a DARPA style project structure

00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,030
and I'll explain exactly what that means

00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:59,030
but in essence this comes down to the

00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,440
fact that from idea to market pilot we

00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:03,500
constrain ourselves and hold ourselves

00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,660
to 24 months so let me talk a little bit

00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,640
more about this DARPA development model

00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,620
that we're employing on project ara if

00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,330
you notice I come from not just Google

00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:13,610
but Google 8f it's the advanced

00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:16,250
technologies and projects group it's

00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,990
headed by Regina Dugan my boss who is

00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,700
president obama's first appointee as

00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,830
DARPA director Darkwa is the Defense

00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:24,590
Advanced Research Projects Agency for

00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:26,930
those of you who are unfamiliar it is it

00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:29,480
is the agency that originally created

00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:32,090
ARPANET the Global Positioning System

00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,950
radar stealth technologies a variety of

00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:36,650
rocket engines and other other iconic

00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:38,319
innovations and there are three things

00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,029
that are key to the

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,829
arpa model of innovation and that we're

00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:45,190
trying to exploit in the private sector

00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:48,789
in a tap and those are projects people

00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:50,680
and partners on the project side as I

00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:52,920
mentioned one of the things is we try to

00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,359
constrain projects to a finite duration

00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,009
and projects live in what's called

00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,109
Pasteur's quadrant and this is a

00:53:57,009 --> 00:54:02,199
construct from political scientist named

00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:03,940
on Stokes and he basically thinks of

00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:05,440
innovative mapped innovation into four

00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,529
different quadrants on the horizontal

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:12,249
axis is consideration of use meaning how

00:54:08,529 --> 00:54:13,660
applied or what is the utilitarian

00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,309
application of the technology on the

00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,019
vertical axis is the quest for

00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:20,650
fundamental understanding or basic

00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:23,380
research and so on the verdict and the

00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,299
in the vertical the quadrant on the

00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,940
vertical axis is it's called war

00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:30,430
squadron it's pure basic research it's

00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:32,109
doing research for the sake of gaining

00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:34,930
scientific inside and nothing more on

00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:37,180
the horizontal axis you see Edison's

00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:39,279
quadrant which is pure applied research

00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,650
it's wanting to put something into the

00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:45,160
stream of Commerce and solve some some

00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:48,489
everyday problem in the upper right

00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:50,709
however is Pasteur's quadrant and pastor

00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:53,259
squadron is use inspired basic research

00:54:50,709 --> 00:54:57,099
in essence taking a fundamental

00:54:53,259 --> 00:55:00,729
fundamental insight of breakthrough

00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:03,219
basic innovation but tethering it to a

00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:05,619
moonshot practical application that is

00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:07,779
extraordinarily compelling and so that's

00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:10,900
where a tap projects live in Pasteur's

00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:12,849
quadrant um we also have an interesting

00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,469
philosophy with respect to people we

00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:17,380
bring people in for a very short period

00:55:14,469 --> 00:55:20,529
of time and we have a very very small

00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:22,420
team that operates within Google so on

00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:25,390
project ara for instance which is a

00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:27,099
sizable effort to make a visit in

00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:29,979
essence a smartphone we have five

00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:33,279
Googlers working on the project yet we

00:55:29,979 --> 00:55:35,259
have 350 or more people and it

00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:37,869
fluctuates from week to week outside of

00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:39,749
Google across partner organizations that

00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:41,709
include large companies like Toshiba

00:55:39,749 --> 00:55:43,869
small companies that you've probably

00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:45,519
never heard of and other partner

00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:47,310
organizations like universities and

00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,410
actually linara and I'll talk

00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,420
a little bit about that as well and the

00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:53,820
reason that we use external partners is

00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:56,340
because it lets us turn on a dime and it

00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:58,200
lets us capture world's best in class

00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,870
talent people that I could never recruit

00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:04,740
to pack up move to Mountain View and

00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:06,680
work for Google full time so back to

00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,870
back to what it is that we're developing

00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:12,270
the best metaphor that I have been able

00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:14,580
to come up with for what we're after the

00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:19,320
level of customization and the level of

00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:21,570
cultural ubiquity is food and so in fact

00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,190
the inspiration for the industrial

00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:25,620
design of project are obtained from the

00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:27,870
Japanese lunch box the bento box the

00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:31,020
bento box is kind of remarkable object

00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:34,260
what it allows what it allows the chef

00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:36,390
to do is to combine a wide assortment of

00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,100
very disparate dishes and tastes and

00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:40,770
flavors and ingredients that are

00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:42,840
disparate both visually and in terms of

00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:44,850
their flavors and combine them into a

00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,680
coherent meal a meal that's made

00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:49,290
cohesive by something that's very very

00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:52,250
simple that's very very elegant and that

00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:54,390
celebrates both the diversity and the

00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:58,770
uniformity of what's being provided to

00:56:54,390 --> 00:57:01,800
the consumer and so that's where the the

00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:03,540
our industrial design came from instead

00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,950
of concealing the modularity we wanted

00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,770
to celebrate the modularity of the

00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:09,540
device we also wanted to overcome the

00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:12,540
preconceived notion that most consumers

00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:15,120
have that modular equals brick light or

00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:17,880
black light or lego lake we wanted to

00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:23,910
make the modules sleek and watertight

00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:27,600
and pebble like an appearance so we

00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:30,540
harness two technologies in in service

00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,970
of this objective the first one is

00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:35,130
trying to not have mechanical latches or

00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:37,140
mechanical connectors try and make the

00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:39,900
module completely as I said watertight

00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:41,670
and pebble lake this is an electro

00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,140
permanent magnet an electro permanent

00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:45,300
magnet is actually a decades-old

00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,520
technology that's used in industrial

00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,070
crane applications that we miniaturize

00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,170
from something that can lift a car to

00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,760
something that can lift something about

00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:56,400
the size of a small kitten about 30

00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,590
Newton's of force an electric permanent

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,080
magnet is similar to as a hybrid between

00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:03,330
an electromagnet and a permanent magnet

00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,160
it has an unstated an off state it can

00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:07,050
switch between those states with a short

00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,770
current pulse but is actually a passive

00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:12,540
component in both of those states the

00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:14,250
second technology that we harnessed in

00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,990
service of our industrial design vision

00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:18,990
was that of contactless data

00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:20,280
interconnects this was the the trade

00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,660
space that we explored and actually in

00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,000
the last couple of weeks we've settled

00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:26,640
on the horseshoe inductor to be able to

00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,110
connect the data between the modules and

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,180
the frame of the device what we call the

00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:33,000
endoskeleton to transmit the data now

00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:35,700
this is not a trivial problem we use the

00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,430
myth em5 layer one protocol which is a

00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:41,580
nice modern protocol it has a variety of

00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:44,490
different power states and it has modes

00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:50,310
from PWM a low frequency PWM mode all

00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:53,370
the way to a 1010 gigahertz 10 gigahertz

00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:55,320
high speed gear 3 mode and so providing

00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:57,300
a contactless interconnect that allows

00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,670
efficient data transfer over that full

00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:03,090
spectrum of frequencies has been a

00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:04,800
challenge now let me talk a little bit

00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:07,020
more about what is the electrical

00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,750
architecture of the device we've

00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:13,380
embraced the industry standard MIDI

00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:15,540
unipro stack that lives layers 2 through

00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,630
4 at layer 1 as I mentioned our

00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:22,080
objective design utilizes the M Phi the

00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:23,790
my protocol we have split the design of

00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,550
the our platform into three design

00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:28,410
spirals all of which are conducted quite

00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:30,900
openly so we expect to have a

00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:33,360
developer's conference after each one we

00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,790
had one in April that celebrated the

00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,710
release of the spiral one design and we

00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:41,790
document each release in what we call

00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:43,680
the MDK and the MDK is an analog is our

00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:45,930
Hardware analog of the of the Android

00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,090
SDK it's the module developers kit and

00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:49,800
it documents the platform and allows a

00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:51,720
module developer without any

00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,190
relationship to Google without any

00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,810
relationship to any of the partners on

00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:57,060
the project to be able to create a

00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:59,790
module that will work that is guaranteed

00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:01,860
orasure to work with the other modules

00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:05,490
in the device so compositionally correct

01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:07,080
so the spiral one platform demonstrated

01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,940
the unit broke protocol it also

01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:11,070
demonstrated a flexible power bus where

01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:14,410
any module can be a power source power

01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:16,000
consumer or power storage device

01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,920
it implemented a lot of the network

01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,930
processing an FPGA so the phone has

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,579
about ten minutes of battery life for

01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:25,359
those of you who've done fpj development

01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:28,150
and heats up like to a crisp but

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:30,670
nonetheless it demonstrated the basic

01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:34,030
technologies and we believe that it was

01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:36,069
the first real instantiation of user

01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,720
serviceable modularity on a device where

01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:39,940
the consumer where the user could

01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:44,589
replace replace the modules of the pump

01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:46,329
and and make it work now we are

01:00:44,589 --> 01:00:48,670
currently in the midst of our spiral to

01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:49,930
development effort which looks like it

01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:51,940
will culminate in the October November

01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:53,589
time frame with a new release of the

01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,630
module developers kit as well as a

01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:57,640
prototype device to prove that our

01:00:55,630 --> 01:01:01,000
platform does in fact workhorse capable

01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,530
of working we have one of our partners

01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,260
on the project i mentioned toshiba as an

01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:07,780
example toshiba is in fact the entity

01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:10,599
that's developing a set of bridge bridge

01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:13,480
asics the convert legacy protocols so

01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:16,539
everything from I squared C USB SD i/o

01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:18,640
and bridge them to the unipro to the in

01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:20,440
Chrome network and that's pending the

01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,630
native adoption of unipro in silicon

01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,660
throughout the industrial base toshiba

01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:27,400
is also developing a universe which ASIC

01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:29,500
they by no means have exclusivity or

01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,390
monopoly on the on the unipro hardware

01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,940
ecosystem they're just first to the

01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:36,279
party but we're actively actively

01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:38,020
soliciting new entrants into into that

01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:39,549
ecosystem as well and so what's

01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,170
displayed here by the way are three

01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:43,000
canonical examples of modules an

01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:45,549
application processor and I'll come back

01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,289
and talk more about that in a bit a

01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:48,880
display module which could as well be a

01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:51,250
camera or something else and a

01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,230
peripheral module and we have two

01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,450
different flavors of bridges basically a

01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:57,069
big bridge that serves ApS displays and

01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:59,140
cameras and a little bridge or a

01:01:57,069 --> 01:02:01,359
general-purpose bridge that serves some

01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:05,289
of the lighter-weight protocols used in

01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:07,390
in peripheral modules uh now as soon as

01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:10,390
we finish spiral two will embark on

01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:12,720
spiral three now spiral three is

01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:18,039
scheduled to run from November through

01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:19,839
through q1 of 2015 and and we anticipate

01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:21,779
a couple of interesting interesting

01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:25,359
innovations their first it'll be our

01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:27,350
design spiral that actually implements

01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:29,020
the pre-production variant of

01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:31,820
prototype bumps or something that could

01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:34,250
possibly go into a consumers hands it'll

01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,950
implement the inductive contact list

01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:38,570
data interconnect for the first time and

01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:41,600
also for the first time we will

01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:43,220
demonstrate native unipro and silicon so

01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,580
we recently announced a partnership with

01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:49,040
rock chip chip maker in China that's an

01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:51,410
arm licensee and rock chip will be

01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:53,870
making a quad-core a7 processor with a

01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:57,440
native unipro general-purpose interface

01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:59,540
over which all of the display camera and

01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,190
other other peripheral or other module

01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:05,120
traffic will go or single unipro

01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:06,950
interface instead of instead of having

01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,380
an assortment of a dozen or more

01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:12,440
different interfaces and we're similarly

01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:15,740
working with with display and camera

01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:17,660
vendors to try and precipitate and

01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:20,600
accelerate the native adoption of

01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:22,550
protocol standards like CSI 3 with

01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,040
storage vendors for protocols like ufs

01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:27,170
all of which are unipro unipro based

01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,320
unibrow based protocol so they can speak

01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:31,400
natively to the our on-device network

01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:34,130
now I promised to talk a little more

01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:37,040
about ApS now today in today's world the

01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:40,160
AP serves not just as a CPU not just as

01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:44,030
a GPU not just as an ISP but also as a

01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:46,370
network hub so all others as i mentioned

01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:47,710
almost a dozen in many of them and i'm

01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:51,190
certain that i'm preaching to the choir

01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:53,720
different protocols that the AP has to

01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:56,990
has to communicate across to the various

01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:59,450
various devices in the mobile phone now

01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:02,000
the world according to project ara is

01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:03,830
that an AP should be just that it should

01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,590
be an application processor and its

01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:09,080
principal function should be to to

01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:11,450
perform a computational processing

01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:15,050
computation and the network's leave the

01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:17,210
network switching to us so the unipro

01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:18,710
switch and a small supervisory

01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:20,180
controller which controls the switch and

01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:22,280
also does the power management functions

01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:24,560
is the only thing that lives in the

01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:28,520
frame of the device so that is the only

01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:30,860
core to the system the AP becomes a

01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,990
module that module could or could not

01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:36,110
have the GPU or the camera is be

01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:38,570
integrated into it we take no particular

01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:40,370
position as the curators of the platform

01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,119
on the correct partitioning of

01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:43,670
functionality

01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:46,359
cross modules so we believe that both

01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:49,789
highly integrated SOC s and

01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:53,269
disaggregated CPU only type processing

01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:55,819
as possible in the ARRA platform and

01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:58,490
consumers will will speak as to what

01:04:55,819 --> 01:05:03,589
integration vs vs disaggregation a

01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:09,289
functionality they prefer and I've lost

01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:12,319
the quicker so we have we have developed

01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:14,269
a notional design of what an arm SOC

01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:16,819
looks like it might look like with a

01:05:14,269 --> 01:05:18,710
general-purpose unipro interface and

01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:22,700
basically and I've mentioned this

01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:24,559
already uf SCSI 3d SI to all of the next

01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:28,069
generation mithi protocols are are

01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,210
native to unipro but we also expect

01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:32,839
other peripherals that would

01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:35,619
traditionally speak USB or SD io to

01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:39,140
speak over the unipro controller as well

01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:43,339
now lastly you might wonder what about

01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:46,279
the software and in fact some pretty

01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:50,119
severe changes are necessary Android is

01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:53,359
not designed today for dynamic hardware

01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:57,349
configurations and so so there are two

01:05:53,359 --> 01:06:00,670
two major categories of modifications

01:05:57,349 --> 01:06:03,019
that we are we're making to Android

01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:05,210
we're working with we're delighted

01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:07,239
actually to be working with with a team

01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:11,269
from linaro to make those modifications

01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:13,549
and we are so we're changing the

01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:15,950
framework the android framework to be

01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:18,829
able to support the hot plug of various

01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:21,289
hardware peripherals so the ability to

01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:24,019
have dynamic configurations of the

01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:26,509
device hardware throughout throughout

01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:28,279
its operational operational cycle and

01:06:26,509 --> 01:06:30,230
we're also creating at the kernel level

01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:32,989
of the linux kernel level a set of

01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:34,609
generic class drivers for unipro devices

01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:37,640
very similar to the way you as b-class

01:06:34,609 --> 01:06:39,859
device classes are implemented today we

01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,769
expect that all of the modules in the

01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:45,289
our ecosystem should be either class

01:06:42,769 --> 01:06:47,869
conforming and therefore fit neatly into

01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:50,329
one of the unibrow device classes or non

01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:52,400
class conforming in which case they have

01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:54,230
to have a user space driver and the

01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,710
reason for that is done for security

01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:57,109
from us

01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:58,970
security perspective that we don't want

01:06:57,109 --> 01:07:00,680
drivers from third party module

01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:03,530
developers to live to live in the

01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:07,280
colonel so we're working on on a

01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:10,040
pre-release version of L of Android L to

01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:12,200
make all of these changes we expect we

01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,990
expect that they will be complete and an

01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:18,710
end-to-end demonstration in the end of

01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:21,050
q1 early q2 of 2015 and the Android team

01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:23,960
has committed to them mainlining those

01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:27,109
changes into future release into a

01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,700
future release of Android in case you're

01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:31,070
wondering I wanted to show you what an

01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:34,220
ro module looks like under the hood this

01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:35,900
is a spiral one Wi-Fi module one of

01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:39,589
those big clinking blocks over there is

01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:42,170
is an FPGA and so that will obviously be

01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:44,720
significantly smaller once we move to an

01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:48,500
ASIC implementation of the bridge this

01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:51,260
particular vga converts from as di 022

01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:53,330
unipro further on the right is the Wi-Fi

01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:55,490
is the Wi-Fi chipset you can see there a

01:07:53,330 --> 01:08:00,410
small a small antenna connector in the

01:07:55,490 --> 01:08:03,550
upper right the the pins are the spring

01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:05,660
pin proxy if you will that were

01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:08,930
utilizing for now in place of the

01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:10,400
inductive the inductive pads once we go

01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:12,290
to the contact list data interconnect

01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,849
those will disappear because the

01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:15,830
inductive pads are just the conductive

01:08:13,849 --> 01:08:17,480
plating on the bottom of the PCB so that

01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:19,460
should free up significant PCB real

01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,560
estate for for developer specific

01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,339
functionality and in the corner you see

01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:28,339
two hand wound electro permanent magnets

01:08:24,339 --> 01:08:30,410
we're working with Foxconn to create

01:08:28,339 --> 01:08:32,930
production volume production grade and

01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:34,640
production costs version of those

01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:37,009
electric permanent magnets that look

01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:39,710
look much nicer in the earlier photo was

01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:42,290
was of a production variant and then you

01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:45,710
see lots of discrete components there

01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:47,029
needed to actually the EP ms do the

01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:50,630
flexible power management that i

01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:54,440
described and all of those will will go

01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:56,750
into into a sip package so that again

01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,609
the from a developer perspective the

01:08:56,750 --> 01:09:00,589
creation of an era module should be a

01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:02,779
relatively a relatively straight forward

01:09:00,589 --> 01:09:06,319
straight forward activity whether you

01:09:02,779 --> 01:09:08,750
want to do it yourself or or pay an odm

01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:11,550
or contract manufacturer to do it

01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:13,230
so we've had tremendous enthusiasm for

01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:15,600
her they are a platform from the

01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:17,310
developer community I mentioned our

01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,990
first Developers Conference which happen

01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:22,200
in April had sixty eight hundred

01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:24,690
participants in total we've had about

01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,790
10,000 a little over ten thousand of

01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:30,540
downloads of the module developers kit

01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:32,190
and we had 2600 applications for for Deb

01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:34,560
ports for developer hardware for spiral

01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:35,880
one developer hardware so we are

01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,220
planning we don't have specific dates

01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,020
but we are planning a second developers

01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:42,089
conference that will run through the

01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:44,370
second spiral of the platform and we'll

01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:46,620
showcase some of the some of the new

01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:50,250
Android functionality and Linux kernel

01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:52,160
functionality for for unipro devices in

01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:54,870
the December in the December timeframe

01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,600
and we've also announced the small one

01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:59,550
and plan to announce a much larger

01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:03,000
developer price challenge that basically

01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:05,100
incentivizes incentivizes developers to

01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,990
enter to developer the platform and to

01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,210
enter the ra ecosystem if you'd like to

01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:11,400
have a look at the MDK there is the URL

01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:13,590
it's a simple simple click through

01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,920
license similar to that of the Android

01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:19,500
SDK and otherwise you see it sort of

01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,050
also happens to be the first the first

01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,430
open reference design for a smartphone

01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,720
that's completely freely available on

01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:27,540
the internet so all of the schematics

01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:29,970
all of the drawings and all of the code

01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:33,030
that we happen to date is linked late

01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:35,390
from that URL and with that I am

01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:35,390
finished

01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:50,390
alright pull this off for two and so a

01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,790
couple of questions were nearly out of

01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:55,850
time if anybody's got a question now is

01:10:52,790 --> 01:11:01,820
your opportunity when I know we've got

01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:20,000
some backward people the question was

01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:22,430
what about security implications yes oh

01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,980
so it is a bit is in fact a broad

01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:26,870
question one immediate comment is that

01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:29,090
it's probably impractical to share ramp

01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:30,710
just from a latency perspective right so

01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:33,260
the unep robust can get down to a couple

01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:34,820
microseconds but you're still not in the

01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,470
nanosecond territory where you could

01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:38,840
have ram that would be external from the

01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:40,490
cpu on a different module so most likely

01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,260
the various modules would have if they

01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:45,290
need ram would have to have some some of

01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:47,630
their own working memory now security is

01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:50,210
a big topic obviously and is an exciting

01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:52,670
topic I think we create all sorts of new

01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:55,870
attack surfaces but also all sorts of

01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:59,330
new flexibility to counter various types

01:11:55,870 --> 01:12:00,920
various types of security issues and so

01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:04,400
I'm not sure that we have the time for

01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:06,710
me to do a coherent answer on all of the

01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,080
all of the broad ranging topics but in

01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:10,700
short we expect a light weight

01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,500
certification process but a

01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,630
certification process that at least

01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:18,020
ensures that modules don't melt or

01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:20,240
explode or fry your brain before they

01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:21,800
get into the module marketplace now you

01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,750
can sell out of band right so we're not

01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,430
going to prevent developers in the same

01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:29,750
way that you can get an android app from

01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:31,250
outs not from the Play Store we wouldn't

01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:32,690
forbid it right but in order for us to

01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:35,990
sell a module we have to make sure that

01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:38,660
it's not actively nefarious we preclude

01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:40,610
a preclude third-party driver

01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,440
functionality living in the kernel right

01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:45,110
so it has to live in user space so it

01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:47,000
could only do so much damage and we're

01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:49,160
looking at implementing encryption

01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,410
across the bus in order to be able to

01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:52,510
authenticate and protect protect the

01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,190
data that's one

01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:59,910
on the bus that's a top level answer

01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:59,910
obviously Devils in the detail one more

01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:11,770
yeah so yeah so the question was whether

01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:13,870
modules can be hot swap while the device

01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:15,750
is running and yes they can so I'm

01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:19,930
remiss in not emphasizing that point

01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:21,280
everything other than the CPU obviously

01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:22,960
which it sort of doesn't make sense

01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,180
necessarily it's not clear what it means

01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,190
to hotswap with you but aside from that

01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:29,170
we expect that most module display is

01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:31,300
out so kind of a hard scenario but aside

01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:33,430
from that most modules would be hot

01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:35,020
swappable and that includes actually

01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:36,430
potentially most interestingly it

01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:38,320
includes things like batteries and

01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:40,090
cameras right those are probably the two

01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,770
most compelling use cases and in order

01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:43,690
to hotswap a battery there's a very

01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:46,090
small reserve battery that lives in the

01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:48,130
endoskeleton that provides some seconds

01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:50,610
of runtime for the device in a low-power

01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:53,020
mode while you swap the primary battery

01:13:50,610 --> 01:14:01,990
all right thank you very much for taking

01:13:53,020 --> 01:14:04,240
time to come and visit okay so that's it

01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:08,550
time to get to work good luck everybody

01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,550
