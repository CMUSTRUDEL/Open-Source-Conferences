★ Session Summary ★
QEMU ARMv8-A system emulation was completed shortly after LCA14 and has been fully upstreamed in QEMU.  During this session we will briefly cover the level of support and functionality, and we will introduce developers to using QEMU for running 64-bit ARM kernels and distributions using QEMU.  We also developed a small set of patches on top of upstream QEMU which allows us to run a 64-bit Android build.  We will explain the status and efforts coordinated between Google and Linaro, demo the working system, and show how developers can start playing with this.
