	Session ID: SFO17-212
Session Name: Open Source Automotive: How Shared Development will Drive the Industry Forward - SFO17-212
Speaker: Dan Cauchy
Track: LITE


★ Session Summary ★
The automotive industry has fallen behind the smartphone in terms of features and functionality because innovation is too slow, time-to-market is too long and there's very little software reuse. Automotive companies like Toyota are now in the software business, and they are realizing that open source and sharing a common platform is the way forward. Automotive Grade Linux recently announced that their platform will debut in the 2018 US Toyota Camry. General Manager of Automotive, Dan Cauchy will discuss this transformation and provide insight into why automakers like Toyota are adopting AGL.

[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,330
all right well thanks for joining

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,789
everyone so my name is Dan Croce I'm the

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,740
executive director for the automotive

00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,180
grade Linux project I have Linux

00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,480
Foundation and today I'm going to talk

00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,189
to you about the AGL project what it's

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:37,059
all about what we're working on and

00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:40,329
where we're going the first of all how

00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:42,640
many people here have a car right not

00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:51,969
everyone but okay and how many people

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:56,069
have a smartphone and how many people do

00:00:51,969 --> 00:01:00,100
this in their car seriously all right

00:00:56,069 --> 00:01:02,739
okay but it's a problem right the point

00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,010
I'm making is the automotive industry is

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:08,200
falling behind the smartphone in terms

00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:13,930
of features and innovation and far too

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:17,530
many people $400 phone with $14 plastic

00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,840
bracket and that's not right it's not

00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,160
right because the car is one of the most

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,990
expensive purchasers are going to make

00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,670
in your lives and you're driving off the

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,860
other line and the software in the car

00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,590
often is three or four years old meaning

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:32,590
and in terms of technology so that is

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,720
essentially why automotive grade Linux

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,240
exists we're trying to fix this problem

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,580
by shortening the design cycles and

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,820
really treating the car like a smart

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,310
phone because for some reason because of

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,620
a hundred-year-old supply line supply

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,560
chain model that the automotive industry

00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:54,060
adopted we ended up in this situation

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,500
where there's very little software reuse

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,570
historically and there's no ubiquitous

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,680
standard so those are the things that

00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,040
we're trying to address and I'm going to

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,960
talk

00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:07,840
today so first of all automakers need to

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,910
realize that they're in the software

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,040
business and a lot of them are starting

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,350
to realize that especially the members

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,990
of AGL which I'll show you in a minute

00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,400
they really realize that to give the

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,850
consumer the experience that they want

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,440
they need to be in the software business

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:28,090
that means that they need to break the

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,570
old way of doing things what has really

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,340
hindered innovation is that there's

00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,110
fragmentation out there there's

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,570
basically you know there's Q and X

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,330
there's Windows there's multiple flavors

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,820
of Linux out there there's too many

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,770
choices and what has happened is this

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:49,840
has caused the industry to redo the work

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,690
over and over from one model year to the

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,700
next from entry level to luxury they

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,950
keep redoing this work because the way

00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,640
the supply chain model has worked is

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:03,970
that an OEM car manufacturer gives a

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,950
specification to a supplier the supplier

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,520
builds a black box with some software in

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,920
it but there's no ownership of this

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,410
awkward there's no reuse of the software

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,380
and so the whole process repeats itself

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,780
four years later when an update and then

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,260
the whole process repeat itself when the

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,550
luxury brand Toyota vs. Lexus the luxury

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,250
brand wants something different in their

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,680
problem now there's no reason why all of

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,530
these should you know they should all be

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,239
using the same platform right it's very

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,760
knowledge as to what enter it has done

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,640
for the mobile industry we're trying to

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:45,459
do for the car extreme if you look at

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,690
open source right open source in fact

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,989
the previous speaker was talking about

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,690
this open source for some reason has

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:56,350
been very slow to be adopted in this

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,630
automotive industry but yet all the

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,220
numbers are there right we have this is

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,850
a Linux Foundation study that was done

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,030
31 billion lines of code in the various

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,490
repositories

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,150
it's probably more by now that this a

00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:13,040
year old report so the automotive

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,720
industry approached Linux on mission and

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,049
said well we want to do something about

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,350
this we see that you know networking

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,700
mobile all the telecom stuff they're all

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,530
using open source way

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,300
why is automotive not being open source

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,320
so their approach Alixe Linux one nation

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,210
and the result was that we form the

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,720
automotive Great Lakes collaborative

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:40,550
program so what is a GL o GL is an open

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,500
source nonprofit collaborative project

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,290
that uses Linux to build a ubiquitous

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,220
platform for the whole industry we're

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,140
hosted at Linux Foundation and all of

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,030
the work with you is in the open so you

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,280
can go download our code today it's on

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,870
our web site and our goal really is to

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,350
fix fix the problem of this

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,190
fragmentation provide one unique

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,910
ubiquitous platform for the whole

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:11,600
industry we like to characterize it as

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:14,240
we're building 70 to 80% of the starting

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
point of a production project because

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,570
the car manufactures still want to be

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,270
able to customize this thing but

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,550
underneath the the Linux kernel the

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,500
device drivers the board support the

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,770
middleware for audio graphics 3d

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:31,610
acceleration the API is for navigation

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,070
voice recognition the API is for the

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,810
application framework the security

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,610
framework all of that should be standard

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,450
and they shouldn't be reinventing the

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,370
wheel every time

00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,229
that's essentially what we've done

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,370
that's what we're doing and that's what

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:48,410
we're gonna continue we have the support

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,530
of ten automotive manufacturers most

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,410
people need a GL don't realize the

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,760
momentum this thing has we have some of

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,090
the biggest manufacturers in the world

00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,900
for Doisneau jlr month

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:06,250
to me she Mercedes Subarus Sookie and

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:09,010
Toyota we are also in discussion with

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:13,210
other large manufacturers such as out

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:15,910
ebw were no fish oh there's tremendous

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:20,500
interest and tremendous momentum at this

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:24,210
point in terms of membership we have a

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:28,240
hundred and five member companies so far

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,840
we're recruiting about two companies a

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,669
week in the in the past couple months

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,110
what's really cool about the nature of

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:38,200
the membership is that it's not just

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,820
automotive related companies of course

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,669
you have the OEMs that I mentioned

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,270
before well we also have some of the

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:49,930
largest tier ones in the world such as

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:52,540
Denzel Panasonic Continental electrum it

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,210
Carmen Samsung all of those companies

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,160
are part of ADL we also have all of the

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:04,270
major semiconductor manufacturers such

00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:07,660
as Rena sauce Intel sorry red size Intel

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:12,600
and XE b TI of course arm is a member

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:15,340
romero is a member separately samsung

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,130
microchip so all of the major providers

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:21,130
to the automotive industry and then

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,570
what's really cool lately we have a lot

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,090
of companies joining because they want

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,330
to be part of the connected car cloud

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,240
ecosystem so non car companies like NTT

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,850
DATA I've joined at the gold level which

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,979
uses very high low because they're

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,600
serious about providing things like back

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,220
in infrastructure for dealerships

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,500
back-end infrastructure for over-the-air

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,710
upgrades all of these things which we're

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,800
actually working on other companies like

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,450
Oracle that joined for the same reason I

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,220
know many discussions with s8p and so on

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,490
so non-traditional car companies really

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,250
want to

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,949
be part of this ecosystem and then we

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,910
also have companies that 100% focus on

00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:04,990
car security so like your dad all

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:12,370
Seyfried companies like missing a big

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:13,870
one here and then we also have a lot of

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,819
companies that are providing software

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,940
services to your traditional Linux

00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:22,449
companies that are Linux gurus maybe a

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:28,530
shop of 4050 guys girls that provide you

00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:28,530
know Linux services and software support

00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,589
so what is AG all about so first and

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,320
foremost we're a code first organization

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,120
I mean we that's our mantra code first

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,589
code refers Gophers everything we do is

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:47,080
come first we strongly believe that

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:49,020
specifications in this case it

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,820
specifications lead to fragmentation

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,490
because we've seen it where other

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,959
organizations have produced

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,550
specifications and then vendor a vendor

00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,950
B vendor C they all claim to be

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,680
compliant but each one of their system

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,589
is different and that defeats the whole

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,260
purpose of why a gel exists so when you

00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:11,649
start an AGL project you don't go to a

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,820
vendor that claims to have a compliant

00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,610
system because we don't have a

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,180
compliance program instead you go into a

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,829
vendor instead you go to the ADL website

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,270
and you download the code that's the

00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:24,430
starting point you done with the latest

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,290
stable version of the code so we're very

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,110
very strong in this point code first

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,430
now it doesn't mean were complete

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,200
Mavericks we have really good

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,720
documentation and we continue to invest

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,850
in our documentation we have self

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,630
documenting the api's we have API

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,720
versioning

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,180
so not it's not the Wild West but we

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,589
strongly believe that the code speaks

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,790
for itself and that's the starting point

00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:49,060
and that's the only way we're going to

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:52,110
achieve this ubiquitous platform is by

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,110
having a code first

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,820
secondly we want to reduce fragmentation

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,000
I mentioned this already before but I'm

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,350
going to keep hammering in because the

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,260
problem with the automotive industry is

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,120
that too many app developers so you have

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,950
people who provide you know companies

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,230
that provide navigation systems

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,170
companies that provide voice recognition

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,940
systems companies that provide telephony

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,040
you know that kind of stuff they have to

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,320
keep 14 to each and every platform over

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,150
and over that's keep porting 2qx to

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,890
microsoft although you know not so

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,750
popular these days but the point is

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,030
valid and then you gotta you have to

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,640
keep porting to Linux and Linux TV when

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,310
they see and there's no standard and so

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,010
we want to stop that by having companies

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,230
that are porting to the a gel type for

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,020
wants and then it works for all of the

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,390
AGL ecosystem that way car manufacturers

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,770
when they get when they decide to start

00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,380
a production program that can hit the

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,810
ground running and it can really reduce

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,520
that market that I mentioned before

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,550
which is the problem with the plastic

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,940
holder really reduce that time in the

00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,730
market from an average of 36 to 39

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,890
months which is the statistic today to

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,960
12 months so let's think about that in

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,450
the time that it takes to build an

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,630
infotainment system three versions of

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,500
iPhone and Android have come on that's

00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,940
unacceptable

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,940
and that's what we're trying to solve

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,760
here it should be a park company should

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,840
be able to build a system in call ones

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,470
because most of the code is already

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,200
there

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,150
and that's what we're trying to G

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,570
thirdly we're fostering this ecosystem

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,360
that I mentioned before where when when

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,860
a production project starts since all

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,990
the vendors and all the suppliers are

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,260
using the same platform all of the

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,280
engineers internally at those companies

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,390
they already are familiar with the

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,340
platform that can really hit the ground

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,650
running so you don't have to adopt

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,400
something new and relearn everything

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,950
everybody is using the same platform

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,840
good for everyone

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,780
study the market I already mentioned

00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,030
them and then all of this the reason

00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,110
we're doing all of this in the end is

00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,890
about

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,540
because we don't want to be driving in

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,339
cars that have three year old features

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,100
right I want to be able to press a

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,959
button and say find me the next gas

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,850
station and the car should know that

00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,160
means on my route that I'm going and

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,720
next to the freeway right those kinds of

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,839
features are what car companies should

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,839
be focusing on not reinventing the wheel

00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,839
with building a new OS every single time

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,690
so what do we provide so at AGL we build

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,959
what's called a unified codebase

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,959
that's our infotainment platform we

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,000
purposely would named it UCB unify code

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:41,019
base to send the message to the industry

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,120
that we're trying to get rid of the

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:45,070
madness of the fragmentation and trying

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,019
to unify the industry on one platform so

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,060
what we did is we actually looked at the

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,339
different open-source plays that we're

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,440
out there specifically some focused on

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,290
infotainment there was a project called

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,940
Tizen IVI which is now defunct but they

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,339
had some good stuff so we took some of

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,570
those components AGL had some stuff

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,880
already so we took some of those

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,740
components a lot of good actually and

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,110
you took a few components from Geneva

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,779
Alliance such as Audio Manager and we

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,070
modified it to our needs but we didn't

00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:13,570
start from scratch what we did is we

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,730
took the best components up their

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,339
unified them and build the platform and

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,140
said hey please industry let's let's

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,240
start focusing on this platform let's

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,070
everybody supported and everything is in

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,839
the open our mailing list is in the open

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,020
the code is in the open you can groove

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,020
down

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:51,720
in case there's one that's not good yeah

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:56,069
well first of all so we we for all our

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,839
BSP we use Yocto yeah yeah so we use

00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,209
doctor for all our upstream and ESP

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,879
stuff and part of the reasoning behind

00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,230
that is that the semiconductor providers

00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,970
that are supporting us like Rena sauce

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,920
is one of our biggest supporters our

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,079
standard development development board

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,879
is the Renaissance art card in fact that

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,120
our car 3 we just started supporting

00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:19,860
which is a sixty sixty four-bit arm our

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,990
first support arm board they all they

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,540
all they wanted us to have the adopter

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,399
model so they basically push their board

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,439
Support Package changes into Yocto and

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,699
then we had our outdoor as the starting

00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:34,319
point they build a Jaylin Tonge and then

00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:36,750
the other upstream self yeah we keep

00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:38,399
track of all the upstream it's it's a

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,189
daunting task but we have a lot of

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,380
members you know Panasonic Denso Armand

00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:45,060
that are contributing following their

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,730
specific areas and we also have extra

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:50,069
crews that follow specific areas and

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,699
then we you know decide when to update

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,699
packages

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:03,830
yeah sure so your goal is you want the

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,780
rate of innovation you see in the

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:10,780
smartphone industry to be the same

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,780
absolutely

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,050
that makes me a little nervous

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,450
sniffing we wanted good wine my

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,580
smartphone when it freezes or not booze

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,580
aya safety curse words and youngbeom

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:33,830
yeah so we're talking in potato this is

00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:56,390
it's a critical distinction yeah from an

00:15:33,830 --> 00:16:00,860
interview yeah you guys very much but if

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,360
your phone reboots call-ups areas so if

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,190
your entertainment system reboots it's

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,150
not the end of the world lighter it

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,560
really is right and and in the car

00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,420
companies are doing it properly right

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,980
they're separating that a functional

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,810
safety critical stuff they still leave

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,280
apartment stuff which I was our previous

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,240
speaker they're separating that from I'm

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,770
going to talk about that in a bit

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,330
because we're going to be addressing the

00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,680
other functions of the car and we're

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,330
going to need functional statement which

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,160
was the reason yeah

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,090
are you also trying to create that

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,090
common

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:37,300
no we're letting the user interface be

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,240
customizable by the OEMs that's what

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,220
they want we provide one but we don't

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,990
expect anyone to use it right it's a

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:51,820
it's for demo purposes it looks great by

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:54,190
the system is user experience sharp into

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,980
the car control right yeah it's like I

00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:03,220
would say the minor part of the

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:06,160
important part of the user experience

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:10,589
that's right oh you know what money my

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,589
nervous system on my car to be absolute

00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,190
success and I don't need the piece of

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,720
plastic because the software is

00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,700
completely up to date when I get the car

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,060
two years later I still need the

00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,380
resupply so that's another thing we're

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,780
trying to solve right so we have

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,840
over-the-air upgrades today but the

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,640
Laguerre isn't theirs well okay how is

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,500
that different than I have an iPhone 6

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,250
in my pocket it's four generations old

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,830
before swine works perfectly fine now

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,120
Apple will decide arbitrarily to stop

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,710
supporting me at one point doesn't want

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,820
me to buy a new phone that's to have an

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,130
arbitrary decision

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:58,930
yeah but the other part lasts for 20

00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:01,750
years and like your iPhone for sure okay

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,310
but see this mentality is exactly what

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,890
we're trying to change I don't

00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,110
understand this mentality why is it that

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,090
the car companies can't say I'm going to

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,290
keep upgrading this this vehicle with

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,720
new features for 10 years

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,490
why not it's total Google but now that

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,120
upgrade man is over are you looking at

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:22,120
one granted maybe some key feature

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,160
requires way more horsepower and they

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,600
won't be able to do it refine update the

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,060
rest of the system and provide the new

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,610
feature

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,820
only on new hardware and that's what

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,570
Apple does that's what everyone's great

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:37,970
yeah yeah drop in a new module that's

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:41,900
another option but precisely this is

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,370
back like this is like this pushback

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,190
that I'm hearing is exactly what we

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,750
wanna stop and when car companies have

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,640
changed the way they think about this

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,080
stuff and providing long-term updates

00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,880
because we're going to do that we're

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,820
gonna have long-term support for some of

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,190
our releases and we're gonna support

00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,660
them for 10 plus years we're in the

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,920
process of defining it how we're going

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,330
to do that because we don't have enough

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,890
cars on the road yet we haven't had to

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:28,600
do that but that's our plan we're gonna

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:31,340
have long-term loot just like well we

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,970
it's definitely on our map we've haven't

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,160
discussed building an app store yet but

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:40,850
we've discussed the concept of having

00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,650
automotive suppliers register their

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,180
applications on our website so that we

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,070
at least have a repository of what's out

00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,830
there and then it's up because there's

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,600
still a level of embeddedness in the

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,520
system where it has to be custom you

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,740
know has to be built and put together

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:59,110
for the cart so a lot of manufacturers

00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,110
are not yet on board with an app

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:19,429
thank you sure sure yeah so we have an

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:21,200
SDK and our goal you can write a

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:23,600
HelloWorld programming about any heart

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,990
okay from start to finish you download

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:36,470
you get your board up about an hour it's

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:38,450
nowhere like an Android yeah no but but

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,279
the reason we have the SDK is there's a

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,500
whole bunch of existing app developers

00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,929
out there they can really easily adapt

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,259
their app use our API and use the SDK

00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,600
and port it over that's the main reason

00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:53,090
and so navigation providers you know

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,750
companies like Spotify by the way either

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,639
you know I'm talking to them they want

00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,990
to port their app over easily and they

00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:02,090
want to make it available and by the way

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,750
though all the major ad providers I

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:08,809
believe will be available in HCl within

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,820
probably a year so that means you know

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,230
the Pandora is the Spotify the things

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,200
are used to and I'm talking to Comcast

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,149
I'm talking to our music right now do

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,299
content expert where we're going to

00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:23,590
define the content delivery api's and so

00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,590
on yeah

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:31,400
we change sparkplug cam belts clutches

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,400
that for love

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,720
you mean hardware upgrades

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:46,050
yeah that's completely on a scope of our

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,150
project right we're because we're a

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,840
strictly an open source software project

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:53,640
and the manufacturers really have hold

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,560
all the keys sorry for the funny but

00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,080
they hold all the keys in terms of the

00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,080
hardware decisions and all the hardware

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,510
is custom for each bar so what we do is

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,530
we run on on reference hardware at this

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,300
point and we final hardware in the car

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,590
is always slightly different so there

00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:24,320
has to be a little bit of tweaking

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:24,320
accordingly I can't hear you yeah

00:22:35,620 --> 00:23:25,480
I want to control their ecosystem few

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:36,840
years before that it's important to

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:36,840
establish right

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,910
yeah

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,130
how many trying to give a bunch of

00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,799
Technology Jose slated about let me go -

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,270
let me finish the presentation let me

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,210
finish the presentation and then we can

00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,970
continue a question so in terms of

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:16,520
releases we're on a really regular kids

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,320
so we released two releases a year one

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,350
in the submerged in July and then one at

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,710
CES in Denver and so far we've hit all

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:27,230
four on time roughly you know within a

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,000
few weeks so we're doing very well on

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,429
this right and what's really what this

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,820
has caused you have to understand the

00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:38,419
automotive manufacturers are all new to

00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:40,130
open source and they're not used to

00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:42,169
working in this environment this model

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,600
so one of the things we wanted to show

00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:46,549
is we can have regular cash releases and

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,480
you can count on them so by doing this

00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:54,620
we really you know we've really showed

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,320
that they can now plan product design

00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,789
cycles around our releases and then like

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,590
I said before we're now working on the

00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,240
long-term support model where we're

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,919
going to pick certain releases that we

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,330
know are going to go into high

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,049
production vehicles and we're gonna have

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:10,760
to support them long term so and by the

00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:17,720
way we name our releases after fish that

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:21,470
was my dairy now is the latest stable

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:26,179
release and you will be electric eel

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:31,940
which is coming out in January yeah yeah

00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:34,880
what's up okay they're cliff developers

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:38,150
we have 850 developers under mailing

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,440
list we your anyone is welcome to join

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,590
this mailing this year the automotive

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,330
discussions is completely open to the

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,900
public that sort of most of the activity

00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,550
occurs you can see we've had like 4x

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,910
this number ie coffees

00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:55,520
theythey forex growth in the last three

00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:58,820
years so very healthy community we're

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,070
getting about a dozen to 15 posts per

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:05,510
day on the mailing list so check it out

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:07,040
and you're welcome to going in terms of

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,100
the media I just wanted to show the

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,420
marketing google us check us out a lot

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,780
of the a lot of the media has been

00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,850
talking about us specifically for our

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:20,510
last announcement we were in Forbes and

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:22,490
gadget New York Times etc thank Republic

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:26,360
a lot of the big publications have been

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,560
covering HDL and this one is awesome to

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,090
get up in the bills it's connected

00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,560
strategies sidelines we're going out

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,210
them I have nothing against Google and

00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,000
Apple with Google's the Linux Foundation

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,560
members so just want to say that but the

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,840
point is that when you get mentioned in

00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,090
the same breath or headline as Google

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,510
and Apple you're obviously on the map

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:46,400
and so you know they're gonna announcing

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:51,560
that they're using AGL for all of their

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:56,450
vehicles this was a huge headline for us

00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:59,870
in terms of momentum in June this year

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,840
we announced that the 2018 Toyota Camry

00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:06,200
which is the best-selling vehicle in

00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,750
America will be shipping with HDL and

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,030
then most of the Lexus they haven't told

00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:13,130
us which models but most of the Lexus by

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,650
the end of this year we'll be running a

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,920
GL so to answer someone's question

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:26,810
earlier sold millions of cars already

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:28,520
and hopefully a lot more nets here so we

00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,100
talked a lot about infotainment but let

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,780
me tell you about our roadmap so we're

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,700
planning to actually address every

00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,770
function in the vehicle we've already

00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,060
started work on instrument cluster and

00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:43,100
heads-up display those are going to be

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,590
simple build profiles of the same base

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,120
code so because we're using Yocto and

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,210
meta layers it's easy to pull in

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,910
packages and decide how to build things

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,480
so we're just going to add or remove

00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,240
pack

00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,340
that we don't need for these particular

00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,470
solutions and then we're also working on

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,809
telematics which is a headless display

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,540
so sorry I had was profiled with no

00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:07,190
display no with graphics etc and this

00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,429
can be used for fleet management like

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:13,520
Hertz FedEx UPS and you can also be used

00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:15,350
for low-end radios old-fashioned radios

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,850
that don't have a screen but you still

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,840
want some of the connectivity he's the

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:24,020
one some of the functionality that you

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,010
can get from AGL and then finally the

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,929
last three are kind of bundled together

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,549
we're going we actually started working

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:33,950
on cultural safety in terms of

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:37,460
identifying what are the artifacts you

00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:40,070
we need to produce four legs in order to

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:45,440
bring into ISO 26262

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:46,790
ace will be safety certification this is

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,100
going to be a long road ahead two to

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:51,380
three years I believe we've been

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,380
collaborating with an another

00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,850
organization called OS ADL they're

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,210
working on some of this stuff so we hope

00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:03,140
to piggyback on their work Hasson

00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,570
autonomous writing our goal is by the

00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,370
early next year is to start a Linux

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:10,460
based platform that has support for

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:13,280
lidar radar camera sensors for all the

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,500
major manufacturers and then we're going

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,590
to port OpenCV for visualization which

00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,760
is the de facto standard in the industry

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:23,380
and then we're going to work with car

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,520
companies to start getting some

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:28,070
contributions from them on stuff that we

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,320
believe is not differentiating so they

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,809
should start contributing that stuff the

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,400
same analogy has been 1407 we should be

00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:36,260
building a ubiquitous platform for

00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,820
everyone for autonomous and then our

00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,850
long-term vision and we've talked a lot

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,419
of car companies about this is to build

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,980
a crowdsource 3d mapping database

00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:46,770
because a GL will be millions of cars we

00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,450
believe that

00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:52,130
in a unique position to collect a lot of

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:54,929
data with the drivers permission on 3d

00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,580
mapping there and the idea would be to

00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:58,920
build a crowdsource database with the

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,809
appropriate licensing that anybody can

00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,179
use to make autonomous driving decisions

00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:05,580
and we're kind of floating that concept

00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,470
around with OEMs and a lot of them are

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,760
very interested in this so we'll see

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:13,290
where that where that leads but that's

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,360
our long-term vision provider in terms

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,190
of expert groups these are the current

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,630
expert groups that we have even though

00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,559
an area the system may not have an

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,450
expert group doesn't mean we're not

00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,030
working on it it's just expert groups

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,740
tend to have a bigger group of people

00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,710
that want to get together on a regular

00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:32,670
basis so a framework insecurity on

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:35,160
activity meaning Wi-Fi LTE etcetera UI

00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:38,370
graphics automated testing navigation

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,429
virtualization and then we're expected

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:43,170
to start a voice recognition and a

00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:47,010
content delivery I've been in session

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:49,920
with well I should nuance just joined

00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:51,390
yesterday doesn't matter of fact so

00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,710
that's really good and then content

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,210
delivery I've been in discussions with

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:59,130
Spotify Amazon music and in Comcast and

00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,470
they are very interested in starting a

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:08,820
music streaming video streaming kind of

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:12,929
API for AGL which would be so I'll stop

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:17,790
here and take any questions a question

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:19,320
kami yeah sorry you saying about still

00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,330
be the fragmentation but let's say a

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,830
platform it wasn't Geneva intended to do

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,840
that so can you explain how this is

00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,250
different from what they tried to do or

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,690
some manufacturers going to be using

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,740
that and yet something around of easing

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,820
your stuff explain the difference so let

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,990
me tell you where I'm coming from

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:39,960
so I was the I was the founder of in

00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,670
Geneva compliance program so I wrote me

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,030
and two other guys wrote this back

00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:47,840
literally and I was on the GB board for

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,070
four years so I know a lot about unity

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,500
their approaches were different and the

00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,490
Geneva approach was to build a

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,340
specification in an on multiple vendor

00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,130
to be complaining and that's the the

00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,720
direction the board wanted to go and

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,100
unfortunately it didn't fix the

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,470
fragmentation problem because what

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:08,050
happened is there was no Geneva platform

00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:10,570
that you could go on down board right

00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:13,059
eventually they built a demo platform

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:18,970
but it wasn't really a full own OS

00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:21,610
distribution like yeah yeah I was

00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:25,530
apparently we sanded because they the

00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,530
manufacturers didn't want it too strong

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,360
does that answer your question sir so it

00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,300
doesn't you yes so Geneva in my mind I

00:32:40,360 --> 00:33:06,270
like to call it bring your own platform

00:32:42,300 --> 00:33:09,880
whereas egl I think it was a challenge

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:12,400
and what Jimmy did really well is paved

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,980
the way for companies to at least start

00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,860
talking and start talking about Linux

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,480
just just legs alone was a big no-no you

00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,340
know for a lot of these companies did

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,670
you need me paid a lot of really good

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:29,320
things along the way and allow for

00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:33,640
projects on Fujio so how many carts it

00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,559
depends I don't know how many 200 how

00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,130
many makers and yeah I show them earlier

00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:40,870
ten makers are partners I mean oh no do

00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,650
it is the only Toyota Camrys the first

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,650
one and only one

00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,330
carplay and the party solution and

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,000
dominant up next on 25 eat food part

00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:53,070
right yeah so the word against is not

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,360
the right word because those are

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,700
projection technologies

00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,070
you still need a full blown right by the

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,480
end you still need a full blown in they

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,890
believe it's the major part right

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,830
you still need a full blown infotainment

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:19,830
system right yes it's just production

00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:21,840
like an HDMI cable yeah yeah okay so so

00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:27,120
you're talking a more philosophical

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:30,720
approach so - let me finish

00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:33,990
Sunfire companies simply do not want to

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:39,000
see control of their cars to other tech

00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:41,280
companies they want to have they don't

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,250
want to build metal boxes where someone

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,870
else provides all the technology their

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,909
concerns that will lead to their demise

00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,909
the same way a lot of mobile phone

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:10,779
that's our experience no we cannot

00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,890
because we're an open-source project we

00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:15,420
would have to sign these legal

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,420
agreements with Apple of the world

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,940
absolutely yeah so some manufactures

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,020
already planned a port is what I've

00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,809
heard they're already planted at the

00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,670
port car plate to AGL and there's

00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:41,500
nothing preventing it because we checked

00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:54,789
what needs in terms of all right I think

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:56,829
we're over time here I just want to

00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:59,020
leave you with this right so we really

00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:01,180
want the HDL to be the place for

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:04,000
everything related to car software and

00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:07,410
so you know really welcome your supports

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,410
or join us join our mailing list

00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,750
