Speaker: Dan Cauchy
Track: LITE


★ Session Summary ★
The automotive industry has fallen behind the smartphone in terms of features and functionality because innovation is too slow, time-to-market is too long and there's very little software reuse. Automotive companies like Toyota are now in the software business, and they are realizing that open source and sharing a common platform is the way forward. Automotive Grade Linux recently announced that their platform will debut in the 2018 US Toyota Camry. General Manager of Automotive, Dan Cauchy will discuss this transformation and provide insight into why automakers like Toyota are adopting AGL.
