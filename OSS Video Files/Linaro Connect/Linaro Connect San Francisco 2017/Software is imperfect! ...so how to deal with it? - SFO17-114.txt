Speaker: Krzysztof Opasiak 
Track: LITE,LMG


★ Session Summary ★
Userspace software is imperfect and everyone knows it but most of people are afraid to talk openly about this. Usually problems start when people try to run this software for a long period of time. This problem already gave server guys a lot of sleepless nights. Nowadays also IoT and embedded Linux world is facing very the same problem. Unfortunately solutions known from server world usually cannot be directly applied here due to relatively high overhead. During this talk Krzysztof will discuss problems related to monitoring embedded Linux distribution. Firstly, available Kernel infrastructure for efficient resource usage monitoring will be presented. Then Krzysztof will try to identify what's missing and show how we could fill this gap using rlimit-events concept. Last part is going to be a discussion on a presented idea and experience sharing.
