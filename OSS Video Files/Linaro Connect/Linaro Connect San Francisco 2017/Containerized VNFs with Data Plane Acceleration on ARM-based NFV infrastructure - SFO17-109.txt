Playlist: Linaro Connect San Francisco 2017
Description: 
	Session ID: SFO17-109
Session Name: Containerized VNFs with Data Plane Acceleration on ARM-based NFV infrastructure  - SFO17-109
Speaker: Bin Lu - Jianbo Liu

Track: LNG


★ Session Summary ★
Kubernetes and DPDK are the biggest hype for NFV solution today. While container provides high scale, low latency and low startup time, and it changes the virtualization model. Also, Kubernetes is the best container orchestration platform, from the test result about containerized VNFs and the community feedback, although there still has some problems to solve. DPDK provides a fast data-path. It’s the necessary component for NFV.
This presentation will show our work of leveraging lightweight, efficient modern container technology to build ARM-based NFV infrastructure. It also describes the deployment of containerized VNFs with DPDK data plane acceleration with high performance and low latency networking design. The benefits of leveraging container-based infrastructure for NFV use cases, particularly on the network edge based on ARM servers will be illustrated.

[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:39,980
okay to continue my VMs with

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:45,040
acceleration on unmanned probe so is all

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:48,130
right our next several days

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,130
[Music]

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,320
so firstly we will give the run of this

00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,290
project and then we will give you a lot

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,309
of oak and otherwise we have s/m and

00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:13,880
then we talk about more about the

00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:18,320
associate and what we want to do okay

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:23,240
yes it is sure our project was best all

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:27,170
aware that only a phase this was

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:30,979
proposed for him if we let me talk about

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:34,090
something about we have that we F means

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:37,100
what the Reister network functions

00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:40,219
include wheels that more factions always

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:47,780
want to be the specific program such as

00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:51,289
the bridge Rooter 503 gog city so now

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,229
with we have four we can move the reason

00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:58,069
network functions include crowd with the

00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:01,939
one network questions in put virtual

00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:05,299
machines so this community will see this

00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:10,910
picture this picture will come from the

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:14,810
other side of over n3 is a blink so we

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:20,210
can see here in over f3 use

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:27,590
so many sources and use Korean or PFF we

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:30,650
have all sizes hand we all know Japanese

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:36,110
become more and more careful as a work

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:39,170
for private proud and for yes so this

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:45,200
hope in future is much wider private

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:50,510
cloud so we 12 minutes for opening so we

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,770
did this is this future if we want to

00:02:50,510 --> 00:03:01,989
enable this for anything there are about

00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:06,620
five schools should be not easy so let's

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:10,820
see these bicycles with boxes well my

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:15,070
word forest layer infrastructure layer

00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:21,110
we used also here we are from also with

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:24,830
forever portal pain we enable difficult

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:31,160
all containers for computing

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:35,750
virtualization layer we never here

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:40,330
in fact we use here for the localization

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:44,709
we added us several CNI of minutes here

00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:46,310
for orchestration air reduce affinities

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,439
so

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,439
[Music]

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:59,140
that's the next page this has shoes the

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,200
detail information of our chopper this

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,750
picture shooters everweb of our job and

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,070
instead well we only lever that person

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:14,230
for pass room in next step we will

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:17,250
enable the tumors or what which please

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:20,980
[Music]

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:26,560
let's see this picture whereby were

00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:30,250
let's say Israel with white color we

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,790
defy the several also here

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:41,290
Trista we should be use three masters

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:45,940
and slaves here and oscilloscope with

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:51,220
program this is the report for the whole

00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:55,750
project we enhancer CN CF opportunities

00:04:51,220 --> 00:05:00,450
so this is consumption for Sierra Sierra

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:03,370
means can another interfaces so see

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:07,050
providers several specs and several

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:10,660
libraries so you also can use this

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:16,930
library to write the target and use

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:20,410
dragon configure the middle so when you

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:24,340
never does reach their openness yeah

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,210
this is Martha's we do smoke associa as

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,290
the master

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:32,490
see a wagon with mother Scioscia

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:37,240
we can use several CF or minutes

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:43,000
improve use for medicine we used one CI

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:47,410
for each spot with motifs within service

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,430
en for single port this is the Brenda

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:57,780
Sierra friends ian is very famous

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,780
it is a borderless simple way

00:06:03,830 --> 00:07:36,630
yeah yeah yeah people are using

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:46,670
technology to create a network for

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:51,470
example in meanings Bridget and so in

00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:56,100
network that would include the host

00:07:51,470 --> 00:08:00,030
child proof preacher over there and you

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:04,410
can see from the right the teacher this

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:07,440
is the seeker promoter Politico and at

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:14,370
the potent method of me doctor operator

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:19,920
and to talk around in the different the

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:23,190
net specificially said you can not only

00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:27,800
talk to each other they use the

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:34,830
radiation method to condemn it and

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:39,470
connected to the to the religion are so

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:45,620
they can help each other so this also

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:45,620
another other ANOVA solution

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:55,190
Carrie Miranda thank you so my monster

00:08:49,970 --> 00:09:00,180
is a simple comparison and over

00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:07,370
networking you use the other communities

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:12,450
and to use what we use to go learn three

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:16,320
networking to create created the narrow

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:19,740
a mobile phone for the panel so that

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:25,830
even is the system is open source

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:33,500
totally Cisco and if you used over me

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:41,590
switch to provider level important so is

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:51,250
this what is the meaning of networking

00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:54,310
but as he is a party is not equally not

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:58,390
before the open immediately before

00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:03,750
what if you look at a innocent

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:08,740
networking you can see how many Lord

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:13,230
Canadian company logic not which you

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:18,610
customer civil service you can give you

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:23,550
for example the nature lovers and the

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:27,850
children in the rock and the in terrassa

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:31,080
where and by the Java and Ursula

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:36,420
something under there Tudor sweet

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,420
merciful roses and

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:45,550
cover the regular to the University or

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:50,800
hisses cause of many mainstream you know

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:58,270
saga so we can not coding Goddard

00:10:50,800 --> 00:11:03,850
performance which our troops reservist

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:08,590
and the people who have been working for

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:15,910
a long time to to Haneda networking also

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:23,680
notorious criminal work or example full

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:30,310
of gathering data and decoding he for

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:33,570
the neck and also other other till the

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:36,450
others Leslie he

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:41,400
they're about that picked out for

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:49,110
example open fast fast and anticipate

00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:53,580
something happens so the so we can see

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:58,590
the hinder come authorized Walker

00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:08,180
so so so we are concerned considered to

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:12,210
use the GDK in include many leap

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:20,580
homologa for faster a great processing

00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:24,900
process and you have the camera and it

00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:30,050
also include many other technological

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:34,170
Bishop to post to post a performance

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:40,730
called I think in Europe Asia lot is

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:45,570
mandatory and new events the could

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:49,860
currently who could be recused kidneys

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:53,700
and they use vision a little scary and

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:59,760
not be some recipes to reduce low

00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:07,350
overhead and that money it will reduce

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:10,770
business and numerous to try to access

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:15,020
the memory spa service as possible given

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:17,400
the human of mattresses and the

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,000
multi-access of all that if some other

00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,000
parks

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:31,170
as it was and you see we have support

00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:37,120
for two years so

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:42,550
so this biscuit and we used we don't

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:47,879
have continued intended to the to the no

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:54,480
indigenous to chose volcano Vicario use

00:13:47,879 --> 00:14:01,449
nitrogen - hello in canoes why is Nika

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:05,230
the parcel is a prophecy a week or p.m.

00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:12,720
but we created I shall be to the antenna

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:18,910
and the devices how did was a stolen

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:23,740
purse ratio abandoned Colonel Joe Allen

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:28,720
to be about Yahoo which were created but

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:34,209
wherever you out us and then you making

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:43,120
or expose those at us in the knowledge

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:51,790
of bf where the greatest in us in the

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:59,379
news list so is the indicator whether

00:14:51,790 --> 00:15:02,420
left side we have a service to the user

00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:07,910
was a user which a user is

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:12,560
basically what a immolated a bushel

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:17,240
Network which used with her to add

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,840
technology the butcher German is my

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:28,460
missus much like the virtual helpless a

00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:30,790
device using that maybe a manicure so on

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,720
the hostile you can use the existing

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:36,020
well Costa

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:40,490
what was the child of two connected to

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:44,870
the worst areas in the camera and we

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:47,980
used both velocity OSA and he also

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:55,360
connected to the registry which is

00:15:47,980 --> 00:16:02,180
periodically so and then this is the

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:07,970
testing we used is a simple that was

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:19,280
allowed to worry and pain from one to

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:24,830
the other and the Nick is okay this is

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:33,250
the performance with God the Father we

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:40,950
used on these things to run fourth year

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:45,769
ago and we have very good

00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:49,589
resistive pregnant and using one

00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:55,399
computation so under the neha job and he

00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:55,399
said this opera is videos that

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:04,279
difference seen so both survive the

00:17:06,020 --> 00:18:30,990
intestine and you can see we did we did

00:17:13,559 --> 00:18:34,530
too so we will see how we see the

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:39,600
function of C s our vision is that it

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:43,110
can pass through the Nick V into our God

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:48,110
so when it can define well single

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,110
thought with fiscal Nick directly

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,410
yes let us with respond you naughty

00:18:51,180 --> 00:19:01,560
enough for okay Juanita a better person

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:05,730
yeah so yeah let me describe the some s

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,800
chronology in short the person knowledge

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:12,960
for every is that if you're in

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:17,430
production environment don't use Network

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:20,640
driver and call the autistic directly so

00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:23,790
instead if you use we use chemical

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:34,010
devices such as vehicle an all-new i/o

00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:41,120
so then we use share memory between

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:44,580
space so for this case we'll shoot other

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,210
several dishes for this year and at

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:50,910
least we should add two more space here

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:57,300
the whole system is not with listening

00:19:50,910 --> 00:20:01,530
ear we should be movable travel for the

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:04,980
Nick and that the successful you that we

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:08,100
should add these physical devices such

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:11,730
as we have all we have into we have

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:15,060
power devices for you our devices so at

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:19,290
last the component came out this

00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:24,330
character devices into well sink single

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:26,660
pot so this is the whole lot more is

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,660
thinner

00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,210
so let's see the progress of this

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,210
project

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,880
firstly for this project we have you

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,000
neighbor that it became in Canada for

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,700
platform

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:53,200
so actually we already never pass

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:57,030
through vessel here the second we have

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:07,270
in has a service unit with acceleration

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:13,900
with this so we have also Kissel impose

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:16,990
order detail and the gospel we enable

00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:30,990
the through this platform country we

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:38,280
have introduced on this project

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:38,280
so this is our spectral with the

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:51,179
inevitable with reason we have it has

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:55,320
for much of which openness so of

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:59,559
possibility project out there and next

00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:02,980
boss so everyone like a high posts we

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:08,470
shouldn't continue to enhance a post on

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:10,630
one platform and then ask as I said we

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:14,470
already enabled we have a low resources

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:20,110
for units so this is not enough we

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:23,290
should continue with such as we should

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:26,010
enable signal set rates we should

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,010
inevitable

00:22:53,330 --> 00:23:00,350
arraignment to show the woman user

00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,919
[Music]

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,039
[Music]

00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,819
[Music]

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:41,520
also so is this is a vacation for tea

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:48,860
okay yeah so and so

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,279
[Music]

00:27:30,210 --> 00:28:20,260
so with this okay I just say the first

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:24,160
step we should have you move the

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:28,900
ethernet driver for this car when the

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:33,760
cell under this cutter into up as we

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:54,300
have found devices then we will pass

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:54,300
through we are foundation yeah yes

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:08,130
because inside the container actually

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:11,680
utility vehicle whether the method could

00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:14,980
you know the I values are some pressing

00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:19,500
indicate so for in a Hello

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,500
if you ever use so probably

00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,150
