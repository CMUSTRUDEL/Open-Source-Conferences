Speaker: Bin Lu - Jianbo Liu

Track: LNG


★ Session Summary ★
Kubernetes and DPDK are the biggest hype for NFV solution today. While container provides high scale, low latency and low startup time, and it changes the virtualization model. Also, Kubernetes is the best container orchestration platform, from the test result about containerized VNFs and the community feedback, although there still has some problems to solve. DPDK provides a fast data-path. It’s the necessary component for NFV.
This presentation will show our work of leveraging lightweight, efficient modern container technology to build ARM-based NFV infrastructure. It also describes the deployment of containerized VNFs with DPDK data plane acceleration with high performance and low latency networking design. The benefits of leveraging container-based infrastructure for NFV use cases, particularly on the network edge based on ARM servers will be illustrated.
