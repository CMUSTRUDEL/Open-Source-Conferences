2. What and Why 1 What is the problem? Why do we care to solve it? Userspace 2 What is the solution? What is the timeframe? Kernel 3 Tackling kernel fragmentation Results 4 Some stats and early results I Agenda
4. https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html I Userspace

7. Faster Device Launches on Latest Google SoC OEM users Easier Device Upgrades Google Better Quality Google SoC OEM users BEtter Security esp. Kernel Google SoC OEM users I Who Wants What
8. The Life of an Android Device Launch
9. I Start with AOSP
10. ... I Add Functionality/Customizations
11. ... I Adapt to SoC and Device
12. "HALs" "Ext"AOSP I Reality
13. ● Short product cycles ● No Single Android OS to update ○ Large AOSP Delta ○ SoC Support not universal ● Certification: Carrier, Regulatory, CTS ● QA ● Support Call Center, OTA Infrastructure, etc... "HALs" ExtAOSP I Difficult means Expensive
15. Architectural changes Android Platform Operational changes Partner outreach Compatibility changes Partner outreach Upstreaming Android Platform I Project Treble
16. ExtAOSP "HALs" ExtAOSP I Solve SoC Support

19. I The Vendor Test Suite CTS VTS Android Framework VINTF Implementation General System Image VINTF Implementation CTS on AOSP Before Oreo Android Oreo HAL Kernel Library
20. "HALs" ExtAOSP I Tackle the AOSP Delta
21. Q3 ACP ALL HANDS Multiple implementations of same functionality Drive convergence between AOSP and Framework Variants Forum involving major contributors to AOSP Feature review, approval, reengineering Non-US regulatory requirements Extensions to Bluetooth, Telephony, Dialer, SysUI, Home Screen I Upstreaming
22. "HALs" ExtAOSP ExtAOSP
23. Must pass Vendor Test Suite VTS; tests for HALs for approval All OEM devices launched with O must implement Treble HALs Must pass CTS on AOSP Q3 ACP ALL HANDS This includes older SoCs that will be used by OEMs to launch O-based devices I Compatibility Requirements
25. ● Release uptake is 6 months to a year ○ Mostly just flagships ● Solving the problem forwards ● Customer pull is strong ● Attention Span outside and within ● Addressing fragmentation is a MUST I The One-Release Fix
27. Existing LTS is not Enough Device Kernel Stable Long Term Support Android Common SoC Kernel Device Release Device Update Clone Merge Cherry-Pick Device Update Device Update Device Update
28. Announcing 6-year LTS Device Kernel Stable Long Term Support Android Common SoC Kernel Device Release Device Update Clone Merge Cherry-Pick Device Update Device Update Device Update
