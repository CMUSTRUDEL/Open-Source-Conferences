Session Name: Functional Safety and development tools - SFO17-204
Speaker: Peter Smith 
Track: Toolchain


★ Session Summary ★
In areas such as automotive where faulty software could lead to a risk to human safety, software development is often covered by functional safety standards such as ISO 26262.
 
 The Development tools used to produce software are themselves complex pieces of software that are far from bug free. In the worst case a development tool can silently inject a fault into the output of its customer's software or give false assurances by failing to detect a diagnoseable error in the input. The functional safety standards used in these markets require the developer's tool choice and specific usage of it to be justified against a standard risk assessment schema, a process known as 'qualification'.
 
 In this presentation I will present:
 - Introduction to functional safety concepts
 - How these are applied to development tools
 - ARM's experience in producing the ARM Compiler Qualification Kit and how we adapted it to cover components derived from open source.
 
 The content assumes no prior knowledge of functional safety, the technical focus is on development process.
