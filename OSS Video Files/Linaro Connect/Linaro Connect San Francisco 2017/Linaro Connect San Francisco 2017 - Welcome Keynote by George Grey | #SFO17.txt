	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,190
to benefit members and the armed

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,319
ecosystem and for details you can refer

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,750
to monthly engineering reports that we

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,610
produce members can but I do want to

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,670
highlight a few recent achievements

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:20,279
firstly opt e the security working group

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,609
successfully upstream the generic tae

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,980
driver and support for opt e into the

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,990
Linux kernel version 412 since the last

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,279
connect and we're seeing increasing

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,489
adoption of opt e

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,410
across the armed ecosystem it's taken a

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,180
long time but it's a great job having a

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,399
fully open source trusted execution

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:47,690
environment available secondly leg just

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:51,719
leg released the 1708 erp release and

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,910
this includes UEFI a CPI and PCIe

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,000
support and the 412 kernel running

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,800
across all of our members hardware in

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,460
addition this release includes new

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,630
packages and updates for Big Top surf DP

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:10,140
DK docker OpenStack Newton OpenStack

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,990
Newton LK open JDK and a whole bunch

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,830
more stuff and all of this is tested and

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,650
validated on member arm platforms what's

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,750
what's unique about this is that the

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,380
source code is all available to the

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,810
entire ecosystem and the ERP is used to

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,299
run the developer cloud offering bare

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,560
metal and virtualized access to

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,970
developers worldwide

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,220
in addition legs new HPC special

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,520
interest group made significant

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,880
contributions to arm support in the

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,850
recent release of open HPC 1.3 point to

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,329
with work from renato and engineers from

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,920
arm and Fujitsu so that was that was a

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,570
really good job getting started so

00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,450
quickly with the HPC group finally light

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,770
has been ramping up through the year and

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,990
recently made some substantial

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:10,500
contributions to the latest zephyr 1.9

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,640
release including the lwm 2 n stack that

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,300
was delivered by the Lennar o

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,800
technologies team

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:20,310
as part of their ongoing end-to-end

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:24,250
connected devices work so please go to

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,470
Lennar o dot org slash downloads and see

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:31,990
the many other projects that our teams

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:34,870
have been working on but it's not just

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:38,710
Linux Lennar o engineers are working

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:41,620
across the ecosystem and are involved in

00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,570
many many other projects if you're

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,960
interested for more information and

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,220
detailed metrics on Lennar o

00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,100
contributions across the open source

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,470
ecosystem go and take a look at patches

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,510
on our o dot org and it breaks down all

00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:02,530
of the contributions that Lennar o makes

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:05,820
across the ecosystem ok so this is a

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:09,280
quote from NHL hockey player Wayne

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,670
Gretzky that's been used before in some

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,870
technology presentations but I think

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:20,830
it's really important for Lennar o today

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:24,220
all of us need to be working together to

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,650
lead open-source software projects not

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,560
just to follow our competitors and get

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,580
arm parallel to them we need to be

00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,010
leading and so working upstream we know

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,380
requires a lot of time and effort and

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,830
our steering committees need to be

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,230
working not only on today's problems but

00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,600
we also need to be looking ahead so that

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,239
we can prioritize our resources most

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,600
effectively we need to go to where the

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,640
pucks going to be most importantly we

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,090
need to prevent fragmentation in

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,580
technologies that are really non

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,980
differentiating before it happens it's

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:06,120
so much better to do that than trying to

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,120
clear up afterwards

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:16,320
so where is open-source going I think

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,769
we're entering an era where an

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,320
unimaginable number of connected devices

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,050
including lights themselves will have as

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,139
much of an effect on society as the

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,020
invention of

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:32,840
incandescent light bulb itself and I

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,120
firmly believe that open-source software

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,599
will be at the center of this

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,330
transformation open source is a key

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:45,020
technology for all of the topics that

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,960
are listed here let's just pick one and

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,569
talk about security for a moment

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,509
security encompasses hardware software

00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:57,069
and absolutely definitely human

00:04:53,509 --> 00:05:00,349
interaction we live in a world where

00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:03,199
core technologies include connecting

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:06,650
devices including connected devices they

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,370
need to use global and not just national

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:13,430
standards countries won't trust black

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:16,689
box security platforms from one another

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,669
and from a software perspective

00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:21,620
open-source solves many problems it

00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:25,339
enables global standards and

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,259
specifications to be created building on

00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:30,650
the collaborative work of engineers

00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:33,319
across the globe it enables developers

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,800
and hackers alike to see the software

00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,020
and probe its weaknesses resulting in a

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,949
more trusted standard way of securing

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,620
programs and data and then each country

00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:48,969
or company can build their own security

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:53,229
value add on top of a secure platform

00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:56,930
but security will never be absolute and

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:59,770
for all connected devices it is critical

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,599
as we talked about in Budapest the

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,930
companies support software over the

00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:08,689
whole lifetime of a connected product

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,719
enabling it to be updated at any time if

00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:15,080
you don't do this the alternative is

00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:20,229
risk of significant loss of brand value

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,229
while you scramble to fix your products

00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:30,269
okay so what about artificial

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:32,549
intelligence this is the latest overused

00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,659
buzzword and the current hot technology

00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,789
topic

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,399
nobody can present a business plan to a

00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:41,129
venture capitalist today without talking

00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:45,779
about artificial intelligence where is

00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:47,639
this pot going well inland ro were

00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:51,959
fortunate enough to have two doctors

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,779
working in this area dr. Kanter vac area

00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:57,689
is chairing the HPC special interest

00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,669
group in leg and dr. yang Zhang who

00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:02,639
heads up the ninety six boards program

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,209
has extensive experience and interest in

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,339
machine intelligence canter is going to

00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:10,469
be addressing and discussing AI in a

00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:11,479
keynote tomorrow so I don't want to

00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:13,829
steal her thunder

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,529
but if you have interest in this area

00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:20,519
please make sure you talk with canter

00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:22,649
and yang this week and if you have an

00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,959
interest in the area because of work

00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:28,589
you're doing in your company please also

00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:32,579
talk to us about what you're doing so

00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:35,249
inland ro yang has been encouraging some

00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,409
investigative activities into machine

00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:40,079
learning and computer vision on existing

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:43,050
ARM processors using the ninety-six

00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,869
board's program and over recent months

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,989
we've been working on compiling machine

00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:52,709
libraries shown on this slide for use on

00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:55,649
arm one of the things that's clear is

00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,529
that there's an arm race just arms race

00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:00,439
no pun intended

00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:04,319
developing to use specialist hardware

00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:07,589
including GPUs FPGA and dedicated

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,159
accelerators to optimize machine

00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:13,649
learning performance and I think this is

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:17,249
a really good example of looking at

00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:19,769
where the industry is going and needing

00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:22,800
to stop fragmentation before it becomes

00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:27,360
a problem in the arm ecosystem we need

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,659
to lead not follow if anybody's had a

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,729
play with Google's tensorflow you'll

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:34,930
know that you have two options if you

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,380
want to compile it for arm

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,690
you basically use the CPU cores or you

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,690
use CUDA which is the proprietary and

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,540
video technology anybody who wants to

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,839
use tensorflow on their own GPU or their

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:53,260
own custom hardware has a lot of work to

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:57,700
do and so i'd like to suggest that the

00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:00,279
HPC sig the Lennar OT SC consider what

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,490
api's could be used to abstract

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,770
underlying hardware optimizers from the

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,709
mainstream machine learning libraries a

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,830
bit like ODP for network data plane

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:13,660
acceleration hardware we're going to

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,209
show you a very brief demo you may have

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,709
noticed that there's a there's a noise

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:20,350
going on in the background because it

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,000
keeps recognizing my face one of the

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,760
things that we did over the summer was

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,640
we took a look at exactly the scale of

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,200
the problem that we faced and we're

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,890
going to show you what we've done to

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,350
date on mobile class arm hardware we're

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:42,010
using the original high key for this

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:46,990
demonstration which is as 8a 53 cause

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:52,779
and we're running Debian Linux so what

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:54,459
I'm going to do here is first see if it

00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:58,270
well it obviously does recognize me

00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:01,180
because it keeps saying my name so we've

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:04,680
got that one down to keep this

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:08,140
relatively quick this demonstration uses

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,620
open-face from CMU Carnegie Mellon

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:14,560
University which is a Python and torch

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,050
based face recognition system using deep

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,230
neural networks and the D lib machine

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,620
learning library with no access to the

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,150
GPU were only using the a53 cause and

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,940
we've made no attempt to optimize

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,370
performance the model for this has been

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,350
trained with some of the UK teams faces

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,450
including myself Rob Booth and David

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,450
rustling so let's see it in action and

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,870
we've got a camera here a live feed from

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:43,270
the HDMI output from Heike up there but

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,630
you will see a lag in fact you won't see

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,730
anything at all yes you can see it

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,940
windows there but let's first see if it

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,560
izes me it did I've loaded a couple of

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,389
pictures of the UK team to see whether

00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,699
they're recognized correctly so first

00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:01,990
Rob booth our CEO oh it does seem to

00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:06,130
stop running but it did keep saying my

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:09,149
name so maybe we'll pick up that demo

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:12,639
later but what it did is it basically

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,680
takes each face and it's providing

00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,570
recognition with a statistical

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:21,820
probability that that is the right face

00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,339
but given that it's been going for a

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,380
while I think the Heike ran out of run

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:29,980
out of oomph so we'll we'll save that

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:35,500
demo for another day so what I'm gonna

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:42,279
do is move on and I can go back to the

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:45,760
slides and talk a little bit about the

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:47,829
implications of AI it's getting a lot of

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,230
attention these days as you can see from

00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:57,040
these two quotes aspects of AI can

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,589
undoubtedly save lives when most cars

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,069
are self-driving in the future we should

00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:05,829
see far fewer deaths on the roads and I

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:07,870
know that huge strides are going to be

00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,459
made in health care from drawing

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,880
inferences from larger and larger

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:16,510
datasets but this technology also

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,949
presents new ethical and privacy issues

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:24,940
and as we asked computers to do more and

00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:28,240
more are we creating an existential

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:33,430
threat as some think or is it the path

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:37,180
towards global prosperity and peace we

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:40,360
just don't know at this stage and I

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,959
think certainly open-source is proving

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,560
to be a powerful way of developing AI

00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,839
tools and it's dramatically increasing

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,769
the number of researchers working in

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,949
this space but the risk of misuse of

00:12:53,769 --> 00:13:00,069
these tools is growing and it's being

00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:02,860
highlighted by a number of researchers

00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:06,520
in the area a number of high profile

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,280
technologists and is being worked on by

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,510
groups such as the open AI group if

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,920
you're not familiar with their work

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:17,500
they're researching how to develop AI in

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,980
a safe way and I encourage you to look

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:27,430
at their website despite recent events

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:31,720
creating a nuclear bomb is very hard and

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:35,320
it's very expensive and it's also pretty

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:40,510
easy relatively to see from what's going

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:43,980
on in terms of testing where those tests

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:47,190
are happening on the other hand

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,830
compiling and modifying code is

00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:54,130
incredibly easy and we have low-cost

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:57,070
access to pretty much unlimited hardware

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,980
resources in the cloud available to

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:05,760
anybody who wants them there is no

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:08,080
barrier to working on this technology so

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,500
even though we maybe don't know where

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,480
the puck is going as an industry in a

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,700
society we need to think about the

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,600
implications of this new technology as

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,960
we create it and I fervently hope that

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:29,560
we will do that in the open rather than

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:31,780
behind closed doors ok let's turn to

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,240
another place where we need to be

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:39,250
thinking ahead and where open source is

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:44,350
having a significant impact sadly this

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:47,080
is not my car ah number of Lennar o

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,770
members have interests and products in

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,350
the automotive space but there are two

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:56,010
companies who were dominating the

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,930
high-end of self-driving Hardware today

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:02,290
Intel with the Intel go platform and

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,340
Nvidia with the PX platform both are

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,690
expensive

00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:10,630
neither is open so could learn auro

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:13,540
members and the wider ecosystem work

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,730
together for mutual benefit on a more

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,510
open platform that could get cross

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,310
industries

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,130
port and accelerate the business

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:26,230
opportunity what might such a platform

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:29,790
look like so from a hardware point of

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:33,880
view we could envisage a camera complex

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:38,860
multiplex from HD USB 2 cameras into a

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:41,170
USB 3 pipe five gigabits bringing those

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,500
multiplex signals in and additional

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,110
interfaces for lidar and ultrasonic

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,690
cameras and then you need sufficient

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,790
processing power to perform the vision

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,550
processing needs quite a lot as we've

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,390
just seen object recognition and a TAS

00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:00,970
facilities so maybe what we should do is

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,300
create a 96 boards automotive reference

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,100
and enable SOC vendors to provide

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,860
different solutions in a common

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,910
footprint that could easily actually be

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:17,260
installed into simulators and cars on

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:20,680
the software side Linux is today mostly

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:24,100
used for non safety-critical ivi

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,860
functions but as the trend moves towards

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,070
creating dedicated high-performance SOC

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,390
s for automotive we need to do better at

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,790
thinking about what the software

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:37,870
platform and architecture looks like and

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:40,090
at the lowest level a certifiable layer

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,580
of software is needed that meets the

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:47,050
needs of safety critical systems and

00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:49,270
legislation the SEO for team have been

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,120
working on a microkernel that uses

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:55,210
formal verification for proof of

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,340
correctness and security enforcement and

00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,530
they're here this week and giving

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,420
sessions I thoroughly if you're

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:05,500
interested in this area recommend you

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,990
attend those sessions on top of that we

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,329
might have a minimal Linux

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,770
implementation supporting containers for

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,290
running the different high-level

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,650
components for example the ivi system

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:20,640
vision processing machine learning

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,170
artificial intelligence and so on and

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,810
security and over-the-air updates are

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:28,570
absolutely core platform requirements

00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,160
for this space if we could create

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,990
something like this then such

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,290
a platform would enable the open-source

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:39,610
community to get more involved in the

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,440
future of this this development as a

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,220
simple proof-of-concept

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,060
we're using 96 boards to interface a

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:52,030
mezzanine board with px for GPS and can

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,520
bus to a dragon board running Linux and

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:58,210
providing camera lidar display and

00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,490
storage what we plan to do is install

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,890
that into a product from a UK startup

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,860
called street drone who are creating a

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:08,610
low-cost self-driving vehicle for

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,560
developers based on the Renault Twizy

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,480
electric car so maybe at the next

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,140
connect we'll actually be able to

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:21,190
demonstrate a car on the stage running

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,130
on open-source software for those here

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,660
with an interest in the automotive space

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:30,010
were having a set of sessions and

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,900
meetings tomorrow and the goal here is

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,470
to gauge the level of interest in our

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,970
members and wider in the community in

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:41,680
starting a more formal collaborative

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:44,520
effort please contact David or yang for

00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,520
more information

00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:52,270
speaking of 96 boards there's been a lot

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,070
of momentum building over the last

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,610
months and particularly since the last

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,350
connect there are many new companies

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,050
joining the ninety six boards ecosystem

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,700
as steering committees steering

00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:07,540
committee members and manufacturing

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:12,070
partners there are many new boards in

00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:15,010
design please talk to yang if you have

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:19,720
interest in 96 boards but here are a few

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:22,270
of the recently announced products the

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,840
Heike 960 brings the latest arm

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:30,540
technology including a 73 and a fifty

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:34,810
three clusters g71 GPU Ram UF u FS flash

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:37,420
USB 3 and mini PCIe Android support is

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:41,440
available for this board in AOSP

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:43,480
and we're also working on Linux although

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,929
we need more effort to get good upstream

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,950
support

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:51,460
for this device if low-cost is important

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,889
the orange pi I 96 IOT Edition board

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,379
runs the bun to includes a camera

00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:58,840
interface and costs only nine dollars

00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:01,059
you can go and buy it today and also for

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,029
IOT applications there's a new board

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:08,049
from Hope run that uses TI's Wi-Fi

00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:11,740
solution and run zephyr there are two

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:13,360
interesting boards mezzanine boards that

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,659
have that have now come out one is the

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,289
neon key which includes an ST cortex m4

00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:23,619
has multiple sensors on it and also an

00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:27,340
LED ring and it's also supported in AOSP

00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:30,070
and we've also just started diver II of

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,379
the secured 96 board which there's a

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,269
session that yokomen the security

00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:37,779
working group ii group is giving this

00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:41,320
week and that features two low-cost

00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:44,259
crypto devices as well as a TPM chip and

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,440
this will enable us to show how to use

00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:50,379
security hardware assist if you have it

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,619
as you develop open source software we

00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:57,340
want to basically create best of class

00:20:53,619 --> 00:21:00,999
security solutions in open source using

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,639
opt e and demonstrating how to do things

00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:09,639
in both software and in hardware in a

00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:12,249
best of class way also related to 96

00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:15,039
boards at the last connect we talked

00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:19,690
about how to build software natively on

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:25,809
arm forearm since then we've made some

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:28,690
good progress first arm now have three

00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:31,929
what they call fvp fixed virtual

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:35,350
platforms for 64-bit development the

00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:39,009
foundation platform is a single arm v8 a

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:41,950
cluster with a simple peripheral set for

00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:44,230
Linux application developers then they

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,960
have the base platform which is a dual

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:51,999
cluster with an extended peripheral set

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:55,809
including geek v3 SMM smmu v3 and CCI

00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:58,620
and that supports the latest public arm

00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:00,909
v8 a specification

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,070
finally they have a system guidance

00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:06,190
platform which is for mobile and network

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,620
applications all of these are now free

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:13,330
of charge and license free and you can

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:16,059
get them from developer arm comm of

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,669
course we also have the Lennar o

00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:21,730
developer cloud which is providing

00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:25,600
developers access to our members 64-bit

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:30,010
arm servers located in China the United

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:33,130
States and the UK and packet dotnet are

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:37,480
also making additional bare-metal arm

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:41,020
servers available to the ecosystem so

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:43,899
we're dealing with developers here who

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,570
are able to actually bring up their

00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:49,029
software and use either virtualized or

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:52,409
bare metal systems in the cloud using

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:55,270
arm servers to do either testing see I

00:22:52,409 --> 00:23:00,070
bring up port their software make sure

00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:02,529
it works on arm I'm also delighted to

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,679
tell you that tomorrow the chief

00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:08,080
executive of socio next nishiguchi San

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,539
will be making announcements about a

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,390
partnership between Lennar o gigabyte

00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:16,000
and Soccio next to bring an arm

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:19,179
developer box and ninety six boards

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,960
micro-atx product to arm developers

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:26,380
before the end of this year and some of

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,049
the Lennar o team including layfon ardh

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,270
have been working very hard with socio

00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:33,789
next on the open source firmware for

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:38,159
this project look forward to a

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,159
demonstration of this work tomorrow

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:44,140
what's really interesting about that

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,490
product to me is not that it's single

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,320
thread performance is going to be

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:51,250
particularly high because it's based on

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,620
a 53 s but the fact that there's 24 of

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:57,100
them on a single core and it's it's only

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,870
using 5 watts of power is I think really

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,130
interesting and I'm really looking

00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,929
forward to seeing what the developer

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:05,760
community do with something that's

00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:07,610
different from a standard two core chip

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,370
okay

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,520
this year the small Lennar o

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,290
technologies group has been building on

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,150
the proof of concept that we first

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:23,420
showed a year ago in Las Vegas the goal

00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,670
has been to demonstrate secure

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:29,350
over-the-air updatable open source

00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:33,140
software end-to-end from sensor to cloud

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,940
running on arm technology and in order

00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,340
to do that we're building on work that

00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,610
we've been doing inland ro and that's

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:43,309
available in upstream projects from

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,710
light leg and the other Lennar o teams

00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:47,720
and all of this work has been made

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,570
available as we've been going along to

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,280
members in the community today what I

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:56,600
want to do is update you on some

00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:00,320
progress as part of this work we've

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,750
coined the term micro platform to

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,220
describe the software that we're running

00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:09,850
on both cortex-m and cortex a devices so

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,610
what is a micro platform

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:17,690
well we're defining it as an open source

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:20,480
platform software that is minimal secure

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,309
over-the-air updatable and provides

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,070
standard programming interfaces for

00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:28,700
developing services and applications it

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:31,429
includes open source firmware example

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,790
code from the first instruction executed

00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:37,640
on an MCU or SOC once control is passed

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:40,220
to the software developer and we've been

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,669
working on 2 micro platforms one using

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:47,630
Zephyr for cortex R and M and one using

00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:49,610
open embedded for cortex a so first

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,049
let's take a look at the Zephyr micro

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:56,540
platform this provides all of the

00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:59,150
non-differentiated pieces needed for a

00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:02,990
connected device based on a micro

00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:05,780
controller so security OTA updates an

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,090
industry standard wireless and iot

00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:11,809
protocols are built in from the outset

00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:14,059
all open source and the micro platform

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:16,550
is based on the upstream MCU boot and

00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:18,650
zephyr projects and a present were

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,960
building two configurations one for UDP

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,840
coop DTLS lwm to

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:32,000
and the other four bigger devices with

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:35,000
full tcp/ip mqtt an HTTP support the

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,580
goal of these micro platforms is to make

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,660
them easily portable across different

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:43,820
ISO sees while maintaining the

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:46,640
non-differentiated core software so that

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,730
developers don't need to reinvent the

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,770
wheel for each new connected or embedded

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:57,050
project and as we started to use cortex

00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:00,530
a devices on 96 boards for this

00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:02,660
end-to-end platform and we started to

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,670
use other community platforms given the

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,730
work that's being done in light and the

00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:10,790
architectural direction for gateways in

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,860
the Ajax project it was clear that a

00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:16,280
Linux micro platform should be the

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:20,800
minimum configuration required to be

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:24,680
secure updatable and to run containers

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:27,550
we see containers as being key not only

00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:31,010
for data center and enterprise

00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:34,910
deployment and DevOps but also for

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:37,460
advanced connected devices and even in

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,220
our simple gateway use case for the

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,280
micro platform what we do is we use

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:47,420
small containers to handle services such

00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:50,840
as Bluetooth proxy ipv6 to ipv4 handling

00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:53,450
and the MQTT and LW m2m interfaces for

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,510
the minimal brick bridge functions that

00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:00,860
we need to actually go from devices to

00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:02,630
the cloud this is a work in progress the

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,480
demonstrations that we're going to show

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:07,520
you today use a headless open embedded

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,580
build that runs on a number of boards

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:13,310
including high key dragon board and

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,470
Raspberry Pi that can easily be extended

00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:20,840
to run on other boards with good open

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:24,700
embedded upstream support so our vision

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,740
here is for a base open source platform

00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,590
that has widespread applicability across

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,920
different market segments for connected

00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,640
devices from high end sensors to smart

00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,670
connect

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,160
devices and from gateways to network

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:43,460
nodes to the automotive platform that I

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,550
discussed earlier today using a common

00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,000
open source platform across these

00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,740
multiple segments will reduce non

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,320
differentiating engineering effort speed

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,690
time to market an in pre increased

00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,080
product quality and security through

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:03,140
reuse of an open source shared platform

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,000
an application specific services and

00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,610
software stacks will be delivered on top

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,880
of the Linux micro platform over-the-air

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:14,180
in containers as open source or

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,150
commercial software we think this has

00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:21,650
application and used across the

00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:23,570
ecosystem and so Lennar oh and indeed

00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:27,680
the work and the team that's doing this

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:30,380
are not expecting to build a big

00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,990
distribution have a huge services

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,300
organization globally we actually think

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,060
this core technology the firmware the

00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,130
kernel the best practices in terms of

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,530
how we're implementing this technology

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,830
in the open source community will

00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:48,740
benefit the distributions om sodium's

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:51,470
cloud providers by giving easier access

00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:55,010
to devices and will also make it easier

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:58,340
for developers to create products that

00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:00,590
are safe and secure and the more of our

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,840
members who participate in this the

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,540
better it will be for the entire

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,430
ecosystem so what we'd now like to do is

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,410
see if we can demonstrate the latest

00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,420
builds now I would preface this by

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:14,960
saying we're we're showing some pretty

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:18,620
new technology here we have been using

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,480
it for demonstration but we have not

00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,550
before we have some Bluetooth technology

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,650
devices here but we haven't before put

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,480
it into a room with 400 people we

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,370
thought of inviting you all to come a

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,640
couple of days early so we could do some

00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,780
some tests but then we thought we

00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,240
probably didn't want to ruin your

00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:38,150
weekend so this is the first time we've

00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,760
ever done this any of these demos with

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:44,480
this amount of Bluetooth noise from all

00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:48,740
of your phones first what we're going to

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,860
do is demonstrate an end-to-end

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,390
platform gathering temperature data from

00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,210
a number of carbon and nitrogen

00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:59,179
ninety-six boards IOT edition I'm going

00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,250
to ask Tyler to come up and and help

00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:13,960
drive this demonstration while I tell

00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:16,640
you what's going on I certainly can so

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:21,100
what we're doing here first is we're

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:27,860
using zephyr micro platform using ble

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:31,970
mqtt tcp/ip and HTTP and we are running

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,580
that on a number of carbons and

00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,230
nitrogens the red ones are the carbons

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:41,179
the blue ones are the nitrogens this is

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:44,360
a power supply a battery and then that

00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:46,250
is connected to a Raspberry Pi this is

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,770
simply being used as a as a wireless

00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:51,800
gateway talking Bluetooth to the devices

00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:55,550
and talking Wi-Fi to the cloud

00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:58,490
now the cloud system we're using is the

00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:01,100
Lennar o developer cloud so we're

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,470
running there porkbutt which is an open

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,179
source device management platform and

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,330
we're doing that in a container on

00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:09,710
OpenStack on the developer cloud which

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,429
is running the enterprise reference

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:17,059
platform so everything from the sensor

00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:19,880
to the server is open source running on

00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:23,030
arm technology so Tyler would you like

00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,160
to first show us the topic deployment

00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:29,480
management dashboard which we've got up

00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:31,970
here so what we have here is you can see

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:36,530
the different carbon and nitrogen boards

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:39,350
in the targets you can also deploy if

00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:42,830
you wish to updated versions of the

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:46,790
software securely over-the-air to

00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:48,830
devices but what we're going to do here

00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:51,170
is we're just going to show you the

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:54,650
temperature sensor data coming from the

00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:57,950
nitrogen and carbon devices so what

00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:01,160
you'll see here is that we have a number

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,510
of these devices one of them seems to be

00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,150
offline at the moment

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:08,120
but we have the nitrogens and carbons

00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:11,929
and you see the temperature in the gauge

00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:14,179
and you also see the tracking there so

00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:16,730
what I'm going to do is see if we can

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:22,010
heat these up a bit useful that it's

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:24,980
portable and I have my hairdryer

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,720
so we'll I don't have much hair so it's

00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,670
it's no good for this so I'm going to

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,660
use it for this

00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:37,330
so we'll heat these up a bit and

00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:41,720
hopefully what you'll see we look at the

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:43,790
can we go up to the top Tyler there we

00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,760
go so you see the temperatures are

00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,740
starting to climb on the various devices

00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:53,450
I can see actually a couple of them are

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:56,030
disconnected in me but there they go so

00:33:53,450 --> 00:34:01,040
this is actually showing completely end

00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:04,490
to end software running on arm okay

00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,340
so we've kind of shown similar things

00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,960
before what we've just done is shown end

00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,909
to end demonstration using our

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,040
microcontrollers through the arm gateway

00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:14,990
to arm servers running open-source

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,139
device management and dashboard software

00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:21,679
so next what we want to do is show the

00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:25,639
new LW m2m functionality in the latest

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:30,139
f4 release 1.9 demonstrating a micro

00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,760
platform UDP co-op and LW m2m build and

00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:34,820
at the same time we thought we should

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,730
change things up a bit and this time we

00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,369
should use open source leshan device

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:43,129
management software which is LW m2m

00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:45,260
compatible and given that we were

00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:47,869
recently at a member meeting in tokyo

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:51,169
and talking to Softbank we thought we'd

00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:53,510
do this on the Softbank cloud in tokyo i

00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:55,760
will admit this uses Ali Baba's

00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,290
infrastructure which of course is x86

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,780
but I think we're going to have to

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:01,490
coexist for a while yet so we're going

00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,609
to demonstrate this using completely

00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,859
different hardware now in order to do

00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:09,830
this we're actually going to use the

00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:12,350
same gateway what we're going to do is

00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:16,180
we're going to reconfigure the Raspberry

00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:19,480
Pi gateway to instead of talking to our

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:22,359
cloud the developer cloud we're going to

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,400
reconfigure it over the air to talk to

00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:26,230
the Alibaba cloud and to talk to the

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,849
Softbank cloud which is the Alibaba

00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:32,980
cloud software running in Tokyo and this

00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:35,650
should only require Tyler to change a

00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,900
single bearable to point to a new server

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:41,589
and he will then use ansible to

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:47,260
reconfigure the Gateway over-the-air so

00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:49,599
if we can bring up and what Tyler is

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:52,510
doing here is he's changing where the

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,390
cloud is pointing to from the Lonardo

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:58,290
developer cloud to the Alibaba cloud and

00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:01,960
what he's now going to do is use ansible

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:05,290
to basically redeploy a set of

00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,730
containers it's they're cleaning up the

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:10,170
old ones and it's going to take a minute

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,160
or two while it deploys the new ones so

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,319
what we're going to do this time is

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,410
we're going to show you can you pass me

00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:19,569
one of the lights Tyler this one we're

00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:23,910
going to show you some lights that we've

00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:27,609
created as open source demonstrations

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:31,630
for this for this particular event by

00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:34,420
adding a low cost maker style ble module

00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,910
from Red Bear into an off-the-shelf

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,369
battery-operated light bulb which we

00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:43,540
picked up her on Amazon and you can get

00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:46,869
from other suppliers so just think about

00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:49,180
what we're doing for a moment if you

00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:51,640
today go and buy a smart light bulb for

00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,619
your home you receive bulbs you get a

00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,880
gateway device to connect your Wi-Fi

00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:57,339
network and you get an app for your

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,380
phone it's all closed you can't see any

00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:00,760
of the software but it it all works you

00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,250
can go and get a Philips you device

00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,650
that's great problem is when you buy

00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,569
another manufacturers light bulbs you

00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,670
get another gateway device to connect

00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:14,500
your home network and you get another

00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:17,079
application why just using the

00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,849
technology were demonstrating here we

00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,400
can imagine a world where you basically

00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:23,290
get additional devices and you do a

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,540
simple over-the-air update of the

00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:27,880
Gateway software and that can include

00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,770
either open or proprietary manufacturers

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,010
software we're actually showing it to

00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,590
you

00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:34,990
completely with open-source and it's now

00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:38,650
done and we're ready to go

00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:40,420
so what Tyler can now show us is that

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,240
the lights have been registered with Al

00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:46,030
Shean dashboard using the updated

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,560
gateway software but first he's going to

00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:53,410
login so you just have to click on me oh

00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:55,780
yeah show the IOT platform oh so okay so

00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:59,500
here we are so what we're doing here is

00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:01,690
we're showing the leshan dashboard which

00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,490
is using the updated gateway software

00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,250
and that's seeing a number of devices

00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:08,320
including the three devices that the

00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,360
three lights that we have here but also

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,640
some additional devices we're gonna use

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,950
a little later so what he's now going to

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,550
do is show you how the leshan interface

00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:20,380
works and how we can control see find

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:23,230
out information from the lights and how

00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,210
we can control them Tyler sure so what

00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,560
we're gonna do is look at this first

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,300
light here and we're gonna do a read on

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,340
it and it gives us some basic

00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,470
information about what the platform is

00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,740
the SOC that it's running in the

00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:38,170
software load we can also do is trigger

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,030
the light to turn on by just writing a

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:43,930
value here and hitting update and that

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:45,850
light should turn on yeah and mine on we

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:52,810
can turn yours on too so we'll do the

00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:58,180
same thing for Georgia's light okay and

00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:59,560
we'll do this guy here as well so this

00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:05,410
is actually pretty amazing we're doing

00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:09,030
this from Japan can we dim them maybe

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,030
how about I do yours yeah do mine

00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:18,540
oh right yeah these guys can't see it

00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:25,440
there we go all right

00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:27,930
okay so of course we could do this

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,440
locally from the gateway but that's not

00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:35,100
nearly as cool as doing it from Japan

00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:38,010
okay so we want these micro platforms to

00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,690
be cloud agnostic will work with cloud

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:43,560
commercial vendors to ensure

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:45,420
interoperability but again we were in

00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,810
Japan we were we were meeting with

00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,940
Softbank for the members meeting and we

00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,740
got to talking to the Softbank IOT

00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,530
platform team who are here this week

00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,420
welcome you to go and talk to them and

00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,220
this is different from the Softbank

00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,350
cloud that we've just used the Softbank

00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,340
cloud is a commercial cloud provider

00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:08,190
just like AWS that Softbank run running

00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:11,610
on alibi-bar infrastructure the Softbank

00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,800
iot team are providing services for

00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:17,070
deployment and management of IOT devices

00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:20,790
and the Softbank iot platform uses the

00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:23,760
one m2m standard to provide services to

00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:25,860
manage these devices that standards

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,550
particularly used in asia by service

00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,320
providers now this time the Zephyr micro

00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:34,290
platform devices that we're using are

00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:38,220
going to use native HTTP through the

00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:41,730
Gateway to send one M to M messages to

00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,710
the Softbank platform and then we have a

00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,080
dashboard that pulls the data out of the

00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:50,190
Softbank platform to show you what we're

00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:53,070
doing in future we can also enable LW m

00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:56,190
to n Co app devices by simply providing

00:40:53,070 --> 00:41:00,630
a gateway container to produce the LW m

00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:02,430
2 m to a to 1 M 2 M proxy so first I'll

00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,640
is going to show you the Softbank iot

00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:08,220
platform dashboard receiving data again

00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,920
from some nitrogen and carbon sensors

00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:14,520
Georgia so here's our nitrogen's that we

00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,020
have here and this is the Softbank IOT

00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,190
platform dashboard and we can look at

00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,050
some of the assets that we have

00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,960
connected so this is one of the boards

00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:23,640
here and we can do a quick read and see

00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,080
some of the JSON data the raw Jason

00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,000
data data settings you can see that

00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,730
we're sending MCU temperature back to

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,890
the iot-cloud

00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,770
okay great next can you show us the

00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:37,860
dashboard we've created to show this you

00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:39,780
give me the devices I'm gonna make that

00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:44,700
hairdryer work again and make sure that

00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:48,630
we're actually yeah doing this live okay

00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:51,750
here we go so this time we're polling

00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:55,140
less often these rlw m2m devices and

00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:57,690
they take a little longer to therefore

00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:02,550
show what we're up to but what you

00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:06,990
should see soon is there it goes the

00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:12,150
temperatures starting to rise and again

00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:14,520
these devices are transmitting data to

00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:17,160
the other side of the world in real-time

00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,820
and we're seeing that data being

00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:27,900
retrieved in real time ok thanks very

00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:30,060
much indeed ok so we have one last thing

00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,000
that we want to show you today we want

00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:36,030
to show you the latest ble software

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,570
that's also supported in zephyr 1.9

00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:42,600
which is the recently announced ble mesh

00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,970
technology which enables ble devices to

00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,710
be used in a mesh network now we have no

00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,660
idea whether this demonstration is going

00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,060
to work but what we've done is we've

00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,760
placed a number of lights around the

00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,100
room and we're going to see if we can

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,410
make them connect in a in a Bluetooth

00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:02,330
mesh when all of you I'm sure have

00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:04,980
phones in your pockets as well so these

00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:07,590
have special software that we've put in

00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,570
to demonstrate what we're doing and if

00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,010
they're directly connected we're

00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,660
actually going to control them Ricardo

00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,460
is going to do the controlling Ricardo's

00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,190
sitting here in the front and he has an

00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,650
Android tablet your tablet which he's

00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:23,040
going to use to control the mesh an

00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:25,380
interface to the network and the

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,290
software on the lights is going to put

00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:31,320
the light solidly on if it's directly

00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,270
connected to the tablet but if it's

00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,190
actually connected to another lamp

00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:38,849
creating a mesh

00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:40,260
then you'll see rapid flashing we're

00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:42,150
trying not to do this too fast if

00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,859
anybody does have problems with flashing

00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:46,290
lights you might want to look down

00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:48,960
during this demo but but there will be

00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:53,250
flashing lights relatively quickly that

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,950
will show one hop if there's actually

00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:58,050
two hops I there's a there's a lamp

00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:02,640
talking to another lamp talking to the

00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:06,270
to the to the tablet then the lamps will

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,430
flash more slowly so what we should see

00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:10,140
is some of the lamps flashing fast

00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,150
because they're connected through one

00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,250
hop and if we've got enough space some

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,990
of them some of them running slowly now

00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,240
if the effect of all of you is to

00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,859
completely blanket the Bluetooth Network

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,660
then we may have to move some lamps

00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,829
around to show you what's going on but

00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,740
we'll we'll see what happens

00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:31,109
so Ricardo I'm gonna hand this over to

00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,760
you alright so I'm gonna use the salad

00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:35,400
to control the devices in a ble mash

00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,500
Network and since the software stack of

00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,140
the tablet doesn't necessarily doesn't

00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,329
yet talk merely mash natively I'm gonna

00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,150
use one of the lamps as a proxy so I can

00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:49,260
talk and control all of the Billy mash

00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:51,000
devices so as a test let's just enable

00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,250
the first lamp which is the actual de

00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,460
proxy as George's just explained it's

00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:58,170
fully on fully branch right so now let's

00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,760
see if the order device is actually

00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:05,670
gonna work right you see that they

00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,619
behave kind of the same way the blinking

00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,589
pattern is the same which means the

00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:15,170
distance is also kind of the same to the

00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:18,720
proxy so let me try something more fun

00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:22,740
which is turning on all of those devices

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:28,339
including it was right in the back likes

00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:31,050
going in fact the mesh is going so well

00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:32,700
everything is just one hop away it

00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:36,930
didn't actually use the relay it's

00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:38,280
amazing which is pretty interesting so

00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,650
this morning when we did this we had

00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,890
some of the lights going more slowly and

00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:45,780
so our there we go so at the back you

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,270
will see those lights are flashing more

00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,450
slowly which means that they're actually

00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:54,240
two hops away from the tablet and and

00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,250
actually interestingly the more devices

00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:02,280
you get of course the more efficient the

00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:05,400
mesh is so this is a demonstration for

00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,350
you of Bluetooth mesh open source

00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,730
software and I think it's one of the

00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:11,820
first times this has been shown

00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:14,390
certainly on on this arm technology so

00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,390
welcome team

00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:29,370
thanks very much Tyler okay so all of

00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,890
the code for the demonstrations you've

00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,550
seen enabling anybody to replicate what

00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:38,280
we've done all of this is is pretty much

00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:41,900
off-the-shelf hardware low-cost is

00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,490
available on github today with full

00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,760
documentation on how to build all of the

00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:49,560
software from scratch so if you're

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,220
interested in replicating what we've

00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:57,960
done and building on it then it's all

00:46:53,220 --> 00:47:04,590
there it's all open so what we've just

00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:07,740
seen is end-to-end open source IOT foot

00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:10,050
to arm cloud the Lennar arm developer

00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:12,810
cloud the Softbank cloud and the

00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:15,930
Softbank IOT device platform we've done

00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:18,840
it across multiple protocols implemented

00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:22,050
completely with open source code we've

00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,360
also shown leshan and hauk bit device

00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:26,820
management platforms and we've shown the

00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,980
micro platforms both for cortex-m and

00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:32,550
cortex a and we've delivered

00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:35,310
over-the-air updates using containers to

00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:37,770
the Gateway for more information on this

00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,120
you can see any of the team and you'll

00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,790
be able to see more of the technology

00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:45,360
behind this demo as well as the tools

00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:52,290
and CI used to create it and test it a

00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:54,870
demo Friday ok so during this work it's

00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,240
become very clear that there are

00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:59,580
substantial business opportunities for

00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,720
the zephyr and Linux micro platforms

00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:06,840
within the open source ecosystem

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,700
but Linares core mission is to be the

00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:12,030
place where the arm ecosystem

00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:15,450
collaborates on open source upstream

00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:16,470
technology working directly in upstream

00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,080
projects

00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:21,600
that's what Lennar o is formed to do to

00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,330
help the ecosystem work together in

00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:27,740
upstream projects and this has been

00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:30,750
discussed by the Lennar o board and

00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,700
Adeline ro member meeting and we've

00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:35,280
concluded that there's a very clear

00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:39,180
difference between open source upstream

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:43,230
projects such as opt e zephyr

00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:45,210
openembedded and on the other hand doing

00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:48,840
ongoing work on the use of these

00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:52,859
projects to create downstream products

00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:55,619
and services and after discussions with

00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:58,440
everybody involved we've taken the

00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:00,990
decision to transition this work in the

00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,270
Lennar o technologies team out of Lennar

00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:05,340
o and they're going to move to a new

00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:07,140
company called open source foundries

00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:11,150
Limited that will be independent of

00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:13,619
Lennar o and part of the open source arm

00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:16,380
ecosystem it's now seeking external

00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:19,109
funding it will not be Allen ro owned

00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,940
company it will be competing and and

00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:24,420
working just as others in the community

00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:27,510
and we think this is important because

00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:31,590
we need to preserve Linares core mission

00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:34,200
for all of its members so Allen and the

00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:36,270
team planned to continue working in the

00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,359
upstream projects of interest to light

00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,950
and other groups with inland ro

00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:43,619
including Zephyr open embedded and

00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:46,170
kernel CI and I'm sure they'll also

00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:48,930
maintain close links with many Atlin ro

00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,820
as part of the open source community and

00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,280
I hope that open source boundaries

00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,320
themselves will join Lennar o in the

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,890
future and will come and demonstrate at

00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:01,619
demo day at the next connect I will be

00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:04,920
CEO of both Lennar o and open source

00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:07,710
boundaries and I'm very proud and

00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,140
excited that Linares created an

00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:13,170
opportunity to start a new business I

00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,700
think this is a really positive sign for

00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,369
the work that we're

00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,500
doing and shows the opportunities that

00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:22,950
open-source brings to all of us

00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:26,579
and I remain passionate about the future

00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:29,550
of Lennar oh and its core mission that

00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:32,520
we all have of helping the arm ecosystem

00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:34,500
to work together on core enabling

00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:38,310
technologies and I think what you've

00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:40,530
seen today is an example of those core

00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:42,450
technologies starting to come to

00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:44,970
fruition and I really do believe that

00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,980
the work these guys are doing is going

00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:48,839
to make a big difference over the next

00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,060
few years in the embedded connected

00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:54,780
world as we go through this disruption

00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:57,780
caused by connected devices I'm

00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:00,750
especially proud of the engineering team

00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:04,410
that we have here in Lennar oh now

00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:07,410
comprising over 300 of our own employees

00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:10,470
are member assignees and our member

00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:13,260
engineers all of whom themselves are

00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:18,900
passionate about working in the

00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:21,450
community on upstream technologies so

00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,970
lastly what I'd like to do is talk a

00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:28,079
little bit about our plans for growing

00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:31,560
the Lennar OE Co system we are

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:35,900
introducing Allen ro associate program

00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:39,300
that is going to be open to OEMs ODMs

00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:42,440
service providers startups and

00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:45,480
universities and the goal here is to

00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:49,170
increase involvement from the wider arm

00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:53,099
ecosystem to provide more end customer

00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:55,200
and use case input and discussion in the

00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:57,359
Linares steering committees so that we

00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,260
know that we're doing the right thing we

00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:03,359
need to look forward we're excited by

00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,400
the prospects for this program and if

00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,859
you or your customers are interested in

00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:13,950
getting more involved in the work that

00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:16,470
Linares doing then please contact us so

00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:18,390
it only remains for me to wish you a

00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:20,730
very good Lennar o connect I think it's

00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:22,560
gonna be a great week and thank you all

00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,720
for getting up so early to listen to me

00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:32,120
thank you

00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:32,120
[Applause]
