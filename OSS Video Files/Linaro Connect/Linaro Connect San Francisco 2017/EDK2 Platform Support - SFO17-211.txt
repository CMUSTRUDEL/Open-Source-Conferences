Description: 
	Session ID: SFO17-211
Session Name: EDK2 Platform Support
 - SFO17-211
Speaker: Leif Lindholm 
Track: LEG


★ Session Summary ★
The reference UEFI implementation, EDK2, has historically not contained much in the way of actual platform support, and has not had any process for dealing with it. For the past few years, I've instead been running a separate repository called OpenPlatformPkg, containing platform source code. Last year, the process for how to get platform code adopted into TianoCore was implemented, and the code in OpenPlatform has (hopefully) now been integrated into the official edk2-platforms repository. This talk gives a summary about the changes in process, code structure and tooling.

[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:21,960
so hello welcome to my horse yeah

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,820
whatever they might find these

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,310
 in this group which was

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,840
mentioning or animal something to my

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,300
Airways both develop it through the

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,750
presentations without problems but just

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,750
an early morning

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,560
so the basic story here having quite a

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,760
short box toka platform is red and plum

00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,690
with indicated platforms the thing that

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,750
was of apartment package the support

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,960
code that was in there as now migrated

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,640
away and the other Platinum package

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,300
repositories have to be considered

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,390
we know the

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,190
historical documents part from one

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,690
branch that secrete the stills have been

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,400
to practice too but that's a special

00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:11,800
case and that's all going away in short

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:15,700
what I'd rather suck all the oldest code

00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,930
has now instead been adopted by Tiana

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,119
for and moved into official repositories

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:27,850
once told indicated platforms on the

00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:30,550
other one ET que tu non OSI and as part

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:34,810
of this change were also going to

00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:40,450
migrate all of the existing blackboard

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:44,500
support the k2 into this new structure

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:47,170
edik a to repository if you see my talk

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,909
at these events over the years you'll

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,220
notice that I've pointed out many many

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:54,070
times that the way hardware platforms

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,600
were in the UK - was completely random

00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,700
and

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,590
the place so rather than trying to

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,930
figure out some way about which

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,210
platforms should be appropriate which

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,190
shouldn't work God with us basically all

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,870
hardware platforms will go into

00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,290
mediation part

00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,290
of course

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:22,640
we will also keep we refer to it as

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:25,880
industry standard drivers so all those

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,660
sort of post control profiles your PCIe

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:33,740
support your AVR your XH di does best

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:37,970
son still be in there using the the sort

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,340
of the C key words of industry standard

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,470
I decided that arm prime cells are in

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,630
history Steiners so we're gonna keep

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,020
those as an depositor as well but before

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:53,209
we blast the virus this ought to be

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:57,470
about the new repositories so there's a

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:59,810
pretty smile ahsoka Matteo basically in

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,040
the olden days before those of the

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,720
platform package you either had if you

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,040
were sort of a commercial platform

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:15,920
vendor then you might be working again

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:18,110
together with some kind of om you might

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,320
be working with some suppliers vendors

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,989
and then you get different drivers and

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,970
platform code and CPU support packages

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,569
you stick all of that either on

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,599
something you got

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,319
don't medicate to which to some extent

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:36,129
device vendors were community

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,799
it's kind of a mess with a platform

00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:40,450
package I sort of at least creates the

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,010
place where we can stick all the stuff

00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,409
that people want to have open source

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,769
rather than just putting in four kinds

00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:51,819
of directions and now with etk two

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,829
platforms and the indication on the

00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,319
other side you still have the option of

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,670
go the old way want to work the pilot

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,840
but there's material to make things

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,909
happen

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,709
though we're also giving aid to an

00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:06,430
end-to-end solution for people who do

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,909
want to open source all or most of their

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,909
platform

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,930
so he became three platforms that's the

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,549
first repository it's an official Diana

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,220
core repository developed only

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,500
open-source competiveness that's the

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,780
reason for the split between to not

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,610
notice on the flips on the Tiana core

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,099
area and github it's called the decatur

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,889
platforms the master branch which is

00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:34,630
really the only one I care about both

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,240
all of the platforms that are actively

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,460
fragile indicate to master I if any of

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,169
those babies build due to changes in

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,870
master they will be expected to be on

00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:48,130
the basis of a

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,900
and if that's not lived up that's the

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,820
point of what you start looking at the

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,690
stitch platform need to be in this

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,690
repository anymore

00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,120
we also have a definition that you can

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,840
have is a favela brunch if you are

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,270
working on getting a platform of three

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,470
it looks like it's going to be a long

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:14,890
process to rather than just go through

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,170
an iteration or iteration of iteration

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,510
you can have a development branch you

00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,249
can pick this is all going to be yes

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,409
whichever

00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:30,439
became a sort of giving you a public

00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:37,999
working space to deal with get your part

00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:40,879
about creating stable branches it will

00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:43,519
seem very keen on having their platforms

00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,429
built specifically against UDK releases

00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,639
so rather than tracking indicate to

00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:51,169
master they would be platforms that are

00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,749
explicitly intended to only build

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,360
against indicate releases but it's not a

00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:58,039
bit more comfort that this is actually

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,469
going to be viable way to be able to

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,799
build firmer with other platforms

00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:05,360
all you think if we do this properly

00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:07,009
within a year or two they're going to

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,559
accept that not everything should just

00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,559
be a master and that's fine but for now

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,220
they can have the state of branches and

00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,060
as I at least suggested on the previous

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,970
slide

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,310
all new open source device drivers go

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,840
into this platform

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:32,650
if this repository robotically do

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,650
to posture

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:42,830
indicate - no no sorry is the mechanism

00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:45,050
we used to either binary only or things

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,479
with strange licenses that aren't really

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,069
compatible for the TANF or were consent

00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,530
otherwise

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:54,590
so it's things like binary under drivers

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,710
and states my assistant controller

00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:02,180
firmware images we don't have the source

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:04,669
code for and this is just to basically

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,639
make it possible for some of the etk to

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:11,180
my favorite

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:13,919
work with this so we have certain

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,599
contributors who by their company are

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,279
explicitly not permitted to touch

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,120
anything the best winery what really

00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,710
needs to fostering and this means that

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,300
they don't have to worry about it and

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:29,219
they can contribute to the open source

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,860
stuff if they're to do so key point

00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:34,860
about this is because it is a very

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,810
special thing about special things that

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,120
don't conform to normal licenses and

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,789
distribution methods there's no default

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,159
one this repository so II sort of sub 3

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:45,949
or each module if there are different

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,479
for different modules with a vendor

00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:51,469
needs to specify which license applies

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,469
for both sets of ours

00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:01,820
so the practical changes with of the

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,240
Platinum package my kind of discreet

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:08,419
that as it was another package inside

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,610
each into so basically all your

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,680
configuration files with previous of the

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:17,210
Platinum package / whatever that thing

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:20,690
was but we've had an addition not a

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,340
feature to the k2 build system the or

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,710
tier we go let's called packages path

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,790
which means you can just tell the bill

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,530
to mom to go through

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,410
multiple directories to find a path

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:34,140
match for the thing you're looking for

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:37,450
so we're using this extensively in this

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:42,010
new system which

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:45,389
we passed by the vestiges this also gets

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,100
rid of the whole sub module or sub tree

00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:52,420
management that some people used to be

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:56,709
with a partner package so for release

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,350
management of this new system we're

00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:02,230
going to need the route something but Mr

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,880
or repo I guess a lot of people working

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,880
on droids are already

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,050
be used for the nard release is going

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,050
forward

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,470
because this is now formally adopted

00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,540
said of platforms we're not going to go

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,030
high to the code review on you know

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,240
usually 5s anymore

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:29,150
so all patches both of platforms and the

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,750
drivers are to be submitted the hated

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:35,900
about adding this in or you if I will

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,150
still be there if you're good unsure

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,730
about the quality state of your patches

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,990
and you want an even friendly place for

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,649
people to put pepper

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,440
to develop sure you can do that but

00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:54,800
basically anything that goes into the 3d

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,800
stuff gone across the city tasted about

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,270
and in order for basically those EK to

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,570
developers to don't care about public

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,300
platform support with find this

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,580
convention but all patches really k two

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,180
platforms need to have a subject prefix

00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,470
the specifies education platforms all

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:19,800
communication on the other side needs

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:21,210
have a sudden preface by one thing I

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,510
haven't had it here but I probably

00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:27,150
should this if you have huge binary

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,680
drivers then please put them in a get

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,860
free and generate the parties with

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,510
passion of my break because but because

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,510
a bit tedious delivery

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,750
and this all means certain factors path

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,350
your complete platform image when we

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:50,790
create two by joining across components

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,930
from different repositories and then at

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,279
the final line

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,839
it's just describing the layout changes

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,180
some of them are just because I did not

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,770
be bothered to Mike shed about how we

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,380
wanted to do this and their water

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,110
proposal already for changing of the

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,730
directory by a spark for ATK to you and

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,370
that's probably still coming but

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,620
basically that if you had out the three

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,380
of the powerful package platforms it's

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,060
going to be a bit tedious to migrated

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,160
across because you're going to have to

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:25,070
change all instances of platforms to

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,070
platform so talk about that

00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:32,040
he's the platform start who migrated

00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,709
over already

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,079
so based in the indicia we have the

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,619
override and override my FAFSA have a

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,809
chat aboard arm do you know the first on

00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:45,600
express platforms including yet the

00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:49,139
thesis foundation mobile my silicon at

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,410
d0 to these were three years or five we

00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,269
have a key to the same state that was in

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,019
a compartment private which means it's

00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:58,139
not the complete but report but it's a

00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,670
start

00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,650
and we're gonna

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:06,400
full support as well

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:14,630
from our valve we have the Armada 7000

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:20,810
support so the foundation is a four

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:23,310
bigger things let me have the chaos he

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,370
used to be

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,990
driver is also the public creep that

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,990
wasn't as big of a package

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,380
Plus was coming up so I'm going to move

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,400
all of the existing motor platforms in

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:45,540
ATK to the cross that means BeagleBoard

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:49,350
pathology pork the best move across from

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,360
two Universal Express yet the marvel

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,869
Armada 8000

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,449
basically both the development platform

00:12:54,869 --> 00:13:02,379
macchiato Ben might expect back to to

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:04,029
show up soon the social mix in greater

00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:06,730
platform you saw those directed this

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:11,690
morning those patches have already been

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:17,000
sent up for review and I expect more to

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:19,040
two of us are subjects of I've been told

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,690
that the metaphor three is deciding

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,690
today this right where as well

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,800
as you may know I find the native build

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,770
system a bit arcane and tedious and I

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,579
cannot be bothered to figure out come up

00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,360
with a correct

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,360
ability

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:48,120
every time so I set up these tools for

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,130
my tools I now updated them to deal with

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,320
this new system but rather than having

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,750
everyone's existing platform

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,360
breaking if anyone's using them I

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,880
renamed the script and reworked it with

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,730
so instead of you particle there's the a

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,040
to build up SH instead of platforms of

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:08,700
come pick that ATK to platform I can

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,820
take this a lot more flexibility with

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,800
the built environments but unless you

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,480
have all of your sword repositories

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,090
checked out in the current working

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,890
directory you do not also need to

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,370
explicitly point out where you have your

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,370
ATK to

00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:29,540
it doesn't mean that it also have build

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,350
output so we're completely different

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,350
from your source

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,680
and while I was doing this I figured out

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,880
it wasn't actually too hard to add

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,440
support for building specifying to come

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,010
online which architecture you want to

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,230
build for so if you have a single driver

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:52,970
education that we want to build lots of

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,970
architectures you can just do that

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,579
this is a short short version for how to

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:04,389
test and verify that this all works for

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:08,259
you is on this slide one of these

00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:10,779
repositories on this Japan depending on

00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:13,480
your compiler version I know to start a

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:14,860
couple of platforms right but that's

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,829
something that we need to fix

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,509
I get it sorted but but it should be all

00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:22,800
you need to do to get started with

00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,800
mediated platforms

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,230
and didn't change the subject but other

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,560
thing I kind of needed to mention while

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,420
I was standing here talking and connect

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,580
we've had a revision of Tiana for

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,980
conservation agreements used to be

00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,180
outside every time she sent out an

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,360
important contribution of creating

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:49,140
version 1.0 United to tied with version

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,990
1.1 the only we've changed is that it

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:55,100
explicitly states any documentation

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:59,960
contributions must be under the

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:02,990
action boxes those of us who come from

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,850
companies may have legal teams with

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,150
strong opinions about contributions of

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,460
Licensing they want to go and read free

00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:14,480
visits any existing internal approval

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:17,660
but I will say but I gave our legal

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,240
department or other I engaged to give

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,070
our legal department the depth of the

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,110
license expired and the response is

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,480
basically worry bothering us with this

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:30,950
this is not a problem and so it

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:34,370
shouldn't be too bad achilles follow-up

00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:40,330
article to post that it does help that

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:45,790
we have two main well yes like this

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:45,790
right that's all I actually have

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,710
attacks screen of worse so if are there

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,690
any questions in the room have one bonus

00:16:52,710 --> 00:17:00,100
why the petitioners my mom but this is

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:05,800
really the presentation job

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:06,490
I don't have any bad - anyone have any

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,720
questions

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:13,420
hey just this is great I just wanted to

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,480
say it's very good I was reading the

00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,540
latest year he really smokes and guide

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,329
to build everything that fight one she

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:26,079
she looks in my mind very little I read

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:29,200
this is basically cytokinesis your your

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,050
vice grips but the old one was called

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,790
beautify build a new once told you but

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,970
but basically if you would've written

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,440
you wouldn't love to see the commands it

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,750
would be inspected a glance right people

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,990
have been used to changing to different

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,550
default configuration five yeah which

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,530
was also always something you can

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:50,510
specify to this is be anyway yeah and

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,480
you do have the dependent or set

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,380
you may need to point out where your

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,590
repositories are located in your file

00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,930
system but other than that it's and then

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,850
the plan would be for the next cycle for

00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:05,050
the next year PSR came in late I'm sorry

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:08,050
there is to plant them then you will

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:14,300
switch it all over for the next year

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:16,130
okay and one last thing on the platform

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,760
is one already so this book is beets

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:23,530
prices will soon the QM you a PMF

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,530
platform yep as well

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,129
it's in those things I haven't ever

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,970
does git bisect work now

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,550
my question I was having problem get by

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:53,890
sex with mother back in for the UK to

00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:56,260
settle the case then well the sub-module

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,320
tactics were did you get here in come on

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:08,170
ISA the sub-module tags running you know

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:09,730
quarter ek2 so the process well we're

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,280
not doing so under to anyone

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,250
right so it's you're basically you're

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:20,770
gonna have the situation where if you

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:24,580
have a change in maybe you get you but

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:28,920
praise API yeah that's a great question

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,920
that's not critical to get run with this

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,000
that's awfully not going to be something

00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,919
with you every day and the fact that we

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,260
now have platforms where we can verify

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,450
this with without the source that's

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:43,140
hopefully going to help drive a bit more

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:46,190
of a to go fix attitude towards right

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,190
near the arts randomly

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:12,700
I guess yeah but uh the the actual

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:17,490
setbacks change is minimal but they

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:19,210
should really only need to specify the

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,990
okay

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,990
Buster's

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:34,880
what an open-ended question so arts arts

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,770
based on generic is always great infused

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,030
in Linux for having a reference to how

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:43,580
to do things we do the next steps are to

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:45,230
show the platform vendors good hygiene

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,860
how they how they should be building

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,630
their platforms to make it friendly for

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:54,440
unifier for these cases any money

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,810
so this few things coming mean one is

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,000
just by getting more of a source

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,140
platforms we conducted coming out didn't

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,230
see is just due to get to go

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,120
Oh platypi kitchen already health art

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,480
get rid of what three or four different

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:13,290
PC iOS Dixie driver support no good

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:17,370
reason so that's been really have white

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:20,520
spec will keep doing that we have these

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:24,920
separate repositories right

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:28,170
that's not my long-term ideal situation

00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,540
but we have the situation with nominal

00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:35,059
ciphers where some people cannot touch

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:37,500
the repository if they're in there and

00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,900
this is a community that's been around

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,059
for a long time and there not been a

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,280
traditional of the source to deserve it

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,080
terrified about this idea but oh where

00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,280
did all this come from and everything is

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,929
going to break and it's going to be

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,480
impossible to maintain this because

00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:55,140
they've only ever had one check out the

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,700
VT k to 1 cpu Support Package one

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,500
provider support 5 Jenna the driver

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,179
support market and I'm not going to

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,280
think and they've done that I did tag

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,590
back and that they take that throughout

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,780
the lifetime of the product and then

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:09,150
when they have you know even if monitors

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,770
paid but not a minor but you know the

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,090
next version of the same platform they

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,920
just start over again

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:20,800
okay so st. bucks

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,800
or different was often Saints yeah

00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:37,100
I apologize but so I got my split up was

00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,080
useful

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,509
one of the things that I've been

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,509
interacting with trying to include this

00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:55,519
it's been rough with so many different

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:59,029
projects just to get over from like not

00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:01,669
just to you know it's not this is really

00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:04,159
having a project giving project into a

00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:06,649
to see is very difficult these are three

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,470
projects there are three repositories

00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:11,659
for one project right but as far as the

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,789
same uh speed matters it's three

00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:16,429
projects to them right so the problem is

00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:17,230
that just adding one project entails P

00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,480
is a

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,269
huge amount of escalation to get

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,740
something at it I'm a little you know

00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,510
that can I know it's gonna take a couple

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,120
months before we'll be able to get

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:30,490
building project package deprecated and

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,409
two more added and it's just I feel like

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,929
the complexity is a newcomer to this

00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:38,139
it's very tense and so I don't know if

00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:39,370
there's anything that can be done kind

00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:41,200
of do a group that at a larger level

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:45,460
just because I'm having the tools the

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:48,789
tools is really helpful but that aspect

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,789
of having another project for being able

00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:53,889
to assemble the projects it is what is a

00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:56,350
situation we have right because we're

00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:58,899
having to salute a nice piece for buyers

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,340
vendors we have their own trees and then

00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:02,230
it breathe the road and privacy that

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,210
I'll share that you want we kind of

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:08,139
needing to keep something that supports

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:11,350
both kinds of workflows it's a long term

00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:13,450
on will you be hoping we can just get

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,960
the platform in hated black box merged

00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:20,399
into the main project and

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,860
if you need winery blocks as well I'm

00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:24,720
hoping that that's going to be a little

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,740
bit annoying for you

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,240
anyway so Ivanova didn't make too much

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,919
of a difference and in fact breaking

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,490
that's about the button for spirit might

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,929
help to get the clean one in instead of

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,240
you okay yeah

00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:42,179
this is not a short-term solution for

00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,030
this I'm hoping there is a moment to our

00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:47,820
solution to this is there any

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:50,340
consideration for I'm mrs. probably

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,350
probably just know I thought something

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,440
that would be convenient would be

00:24:52,350 --> 00:25:00,360
different platform packages continued on

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,779
but you may be played to more code

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,779
converge

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,450
many it's about branch

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,170
because otherwise that you know for

00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,330
folks you don't want to rework their

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,390
entire build systems for all these new

00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,710
projects and then I get this is more

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,630
work than you probably just want to do

00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,250
itself well I ate something I want to do

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,900
and maybe it would mean you have to bug

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:30,470
repositories like they think that sounds

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:33,020
like planted you live here but they're

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:38,170
not compatible those parties the

00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,170
different sort of parrot

00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,230
okay are we at time

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:57,289
okay do the bonus life which is the

00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,530
unified support of youth to rock Clark

00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:04,100
and I was for us and others keep filling

00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:07,549
away instead of Vietnam he would unify

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,990
support a new hood and they're now able

00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:15,559
to run my show binary as a communicative

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:17,870
under you good which means they

00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:21,409
immediately have all they need to be

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:24,260
able to run unify a CT which is a point

00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:26,419
at which by it very happy because then

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,090
we have a city running across two

00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,280
completely separate implementations of

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,190
the unified specification which means we

00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,370
can start testing access to me so I'm

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,770
really pleased to that it's not work

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,929
currently because SCT is heavily

00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,480
dependent of being able to write logs

00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:45,789
and status into the file system and

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,190
reboot

00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:50,019
doing thanks I'm currently you it

00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,629
doesn't have five five season righteous

00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:53,950
work so that's probably the big deal but

00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:56,260
they're gonna have to work I don't want

00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:01,110
to get this

00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:01,110
this is pretty good start please

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,179
okay

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,179
okay

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,770
