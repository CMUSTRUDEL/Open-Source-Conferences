	Session ID: SFO17-119
Session Name: Performance Evaluation for Containerized NFV-I on Arm via OPNFV Yardstick - SFO17-119
Speaker: Herbert Guan
Track: LNG


★ Session Summary ★
As we know, container technology are the most eminent virtualization technology today. For ARM NFVI infrastructure, Kubernetes is used as the container orchestration engine with DPDK data plane acceleration for container networking. How to evaluate the performance metrics(throughput, latency, jitter) automatically with a built-in mechanism of the whole NFVI infrastructure is an important problem. On the other hand, for CI-CD purpose of our NFVI development work, how to efficiently measure, collect and analyze the performance data of the container networking environment for ARM container based NFVI infrastructure is also an important issue to deal with.

[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:23,390
anyway to continue and thrive beyond

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:26,450
whatever issue today I'm going to make

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:30,619
the presentation performance evaluation

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:34,910
for environment and SP infrastructure we

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:37,489
are open if we just take first of all I

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:42,350
have to send to Germantown my colleague

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:46,300
in there start operating in here back

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,300
today actually most of the work

00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:06,350
so their dinner today first of all I'm

00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:10,159
going to introduce to everyone for why

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:13,159
we are doing these efforts did and then

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:18,740
I'm going to introduce a bit about open

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:21,549
FB testing community and third we were

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,979
going to show what we have done recently

00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:28,090
on last year and to share some test

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:31,670
results we have get facing down our

00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,579
moments and the summary we have some

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:39,939
ideas and plans in our Xterra and

00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:39,939
instead I'm going to share with you here

00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:52,280
because the shoulder now this picture

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:56,440
shows the NFP from structure and the

00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,590
inside is red block it is

00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:04,869
infrastructure pant platforms so Cheers

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:11,110
we can see if you deserver panceliss and

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:11,110
they are analytical in the Google

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:20,680
infrastructure and this analyzed and SP

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:26,450
infrastructure our arms actually arise

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:29,900
over FB and s Athena for NFC project we

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:33,500
can get more details from link below the

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:39,709
picture for more information about

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:42,860
container for o nsv the networking if

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:46,280
actually the basis of penalized and SB

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,690
infrastructure so what people had picked

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,450
up and Catina live the infrastructure

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:58,870
then they will have the question how to

00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:06,500
evaluate the digital performance this

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:11,360
infrastructure efficiently so to do

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:14,840
before we answer this question we can't

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,079
have a look into the into the technical

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:23,570
community another legacy NFP

00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:26,510
infrastructure the idea that since the

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,090
thing about them as infrastructure

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,930
inherited throughout the trepanned

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:39,290
legacy in my infrastructure which is a

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:41,540
star of the commercial and regime so we

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:46,780
can really likely to live illegitimate

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:51,489
emptiness lawlessness in the legacy

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:57,799
infrastructure so let's have a look here

00:03:51,489 --> 00:04:00,109
this energy infrastructure and in the

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:04,150
open we testing community

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:07,940
yes measuring three kinds of health

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:13,849
they're compliant empty the functional

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:19,389
testing under Don't Tell and the fun

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:19,389
test they are the key component in

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:27,090
testing here we can see young Steve the

00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:31,750
key component of their for the

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,880
performance testing so I'm not sure why

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,699
it's called adaptive not a rule about

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,490
assistive so what do we know yes they

00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,780
also form elements to wear make sure

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:52,710
their networking performance of an

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:59,560
infrastructure so here let's have a look

00:04:52,710 --> 00:05:03,310
interested from a few young skiers can

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,669
open any project until the tenth real

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,159
world with temptations and stimuli to

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:13,300
the label and that's the infrastructure

00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:17,199
and performance verification nasty self

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:20,650
includes several kinds of temptations

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:27,969
are tested scenarios such as being I

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:32,440
brought karate etc and originally he

00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:37,300
just did Devon before the legacy and as

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,960
we infrastructure and recently there's a

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:46,060
thoughtful communities and the container

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:51,569
intended is about two months ago inside

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:55,780
the active there's five key components

00:05:51,569 --> 00:06:05,250
in fact that the scenario context random

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:08,360
depression the scenario they defines

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:14,650
what kind of class of high

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:18,560
is going to do that oh I love this curve

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:22,189
for different numbers and as well as

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,500
context the context of the sense of

00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:28,699
cloud the forces that is going to be

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:32,539
used by the festivities in Dario if for

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:36,229
example the user names imaginings are

00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:40,340
the affinity rules and it working some

00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:44,779
configurations we are all acquired in

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:49,389
the context and the runner the logic

00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:55,330
that's actually exclusive the tentacles

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:55,330
into the work required with how how the

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:10,639
it's quite how the case is going to be

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:15,530
experience like commonly time of the

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:19,180
iterations and how long did television

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:24,950
is the standing size of that of the test

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:28,880
and for dispatcher when the efficacy is

00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,450
being included the defense model were

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,760
correct

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:37,930
again dispatch the test results to

00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:46,120
target such as the file or an intercity

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:51,860
HTTP for reference type of the user and

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:55,220
your tips to fill in so it's a country

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,130
that was not even layer that allows user

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,270
to integrate other who have retest

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:05,690
projects to work together without fear

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:08,750
actually missed work for in the past

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:12,500
performance super knowledgeable and

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,130
could hear is paying for it with a lot

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,329
of

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,329
[Music]

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,450
okay utilize we are going to have a look

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:35,830
interactive throughout the workflow

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:43,330
point of view during analysis so it's

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:47,790
actually ready as container and the

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:53,800
interface it's virtually training as a

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:56,770
courageous and if some host what it's

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,530
going to do kick off protest last it

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:04,240
will first offender all to the context

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:07,270
information to preventive pastor and did

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,990
the communities master well-coordinated

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:15,870
initialize their environment such as for

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:19,410
example to create and the tabular form

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:23,910
the host port and attack the pod can be

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:30,870
either on the screen or via phone and

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:36,250
they can either be allocated same host

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:40,450
are two or more different forces so they

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:45,730
are not in the same host there's

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,770
relatively little here is being used

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,340
the reason we're actually family the

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:55,090
world before ever think of in a

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:57,070
environment setup but other people will

00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,440
be happy nation doesn't know if we are

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:06,199
pursuing for some high-performance

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:09,529
the interworking solution while he only

00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:13,370
for the verse 4 there is verification of

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:17,839
our name on our platform so finally the

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:21,139
world can use either here and after the

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,230
contest is set up I am still aware of

00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:27,709
them to send the testers which means the

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:31,939
tester scenario to host power and then

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:34,519
the host part will kick off the test to

00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:38,180
relative render after performance

00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:42,500
testing when the performance testing of

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:46,180
being a future the dispersive of you in

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,959
your still well together to collect

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:54,069
tetra vows and the energy is as yet

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:56,600
income at least into the influx TV and

00:10:54,069 --> 00:11:00,680
if we are allowed to Prasanna

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:06,199
to show some technologies and think it

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:10,880
was and finally when other kids are

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:15,819
finished I stopped the octave will ask

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:19,189
whoever is master to clean up the rabbit

00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:24,199
for example to a deploying the applause

00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:27,550
and to free the resources and everything

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,550
here for the contest

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:41,570
okay now I'm going to have introduction

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:48,230
about so we have done I mention it now

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:52,580
yeah it was originally only for legacy

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,440
infrastructure and support focus

00:11:52,580 --> 00:12:01,290
recently and they voted while that's

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,840
still only x86 platform so first of all

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:09,940
we we have to remain weight of the pump

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:13,019
at once example do some modifications to

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,019
[Music]

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:26,280
and in fact most of the test cases in

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:29,960
last year can only be running in Bush

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:35,400
machine environments because of the

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:38,130
rugged individuals and in the because of

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,650
the difference between virtual machine

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:45,780
and a container we make some further

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:49,620
efforts to enable several cases such a

00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:53,630
thing I hope to make them to be able to

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:58,560
throughout the in the container rabbit

00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:02,190
and the based on te to enable unable to

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,420
work we are able to do some testing and

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:11,850
a curricular test results and have a

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:16,290
duration and also during our effort in

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:19,040
these moments and 15,000 connection we

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:28,520
find there's some generalizations in

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:42,710
nothing when interacting with kubernetes

00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:42,710
our explain referred to share some to

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,090
[Music]

00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:06,840
first evaluate the team teaching so it's

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:10,920
the Chinese latency between the whole

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:15,990
support and at the time the clock and we

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:19,260
consider the interpretation in the

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:23,160
supposed to use case both for support

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:28,110
and as a technical education in a safe

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:31,020
area metal machine so because they are

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:35,600
almost environmental yeah no traffic

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:39,949
between host and target that not have to

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:44,089
found it work and other the vote you can

00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:48,109
see the average latency in this case of

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:52,269
the best it's about 0.3 seconds in

00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:55,939
average and the into the user case to

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:58,759
the host anatomical corner are different

00:14:55,939 --> 00:15:01,009
they are results so the traffic between

00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:05,899
them have to go through the Ferragamo to

00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:09,859
work and not only have made the original

00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:18,739
agency police it's about someone points

00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:20,959
to music is and if I was the case the

00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:24,109
target Republican actually not

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,600
officially which machine because of the

00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:29,299
extra cost between universe was really

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,100
the whole you know the average latency

00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:34,369
you feel included

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,729
it's about two or three incidents in

00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:36,729
this case

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:54,370
and the second you when you lean it

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:57,810
curved we have similar finding that's

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:01,690
true a winter coat target container

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:05,050
allocated are two different variables we

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,779
can see the fluid here are low and

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:11,010
interagency at the heart and when they

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:11,010
are our saying they are metal

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:19,440
through the fire and reduce so we can

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:42,550
statement infrastructure but what we

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:47,589
have to mention in the test results

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:52,360
showed were deal from trak-1 to the

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:57,240
platform and the difference here only

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,240
for quality residence on the covers so

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:11,980
when we are we are 50/50 in violence we

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:16,500
do have some may sound travels a for

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,500
example everyone

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:26,589
under the investor usually it'll only

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:33,060
take our syllabus for 10 minutes to lift

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:33,060
on theta but actually several days to

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:44,770
what actually the authority that we have

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:48,910
a lot of notes available for us to

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:53,350
deploy it should but in life it becomes

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:56,560
our disability until because that the

00:17:53,350 --> 00:18:00,220
current university can not select which

00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,400
node the fabula call our host for

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,440
support should be deployed arm so

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,720
what're we have anemia now to

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,980
temporarily disable all the other nodes

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,620
and then to have only one time to

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:18,310
politic kind of an entities of other

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:20,440
levels of energy deployed to create

00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:24,340
another polyphony Takata but what a

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,170
beautiful so this very long efficient

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,350
time we have to wait for the other

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:34,390
people to be bodies to do that otherwise

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:39,930
they will be impacted so the first thing

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:42,850
we want to do in our one excessive and

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:45,070
 expansions for Communities

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,890
council context

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,640
in fact the kubernetes is zero already a

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:53,590
positive no the director visual director

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,590
the Poland here that job still currently

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,930
must provide essential information

00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,550
delicious so this is our first of them

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,389
to make

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:08,700
be supported a non-selective

00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:27,869
connection and we also plan to enable

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:31,139
the cases this helene acceleration and

00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:33,719
we also have to label more test

00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:39,149
scenarios for alibis and every

00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:43,649
infrastructure such as their performance

00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:49,950
and this one to make it impossible to

00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:53,789
cannonball specific routes and then also

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:58,249
we hope to enable cases between the

00:19:53,789 --> 00:20:13,030
Machine and the academically you hadn't

00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:15,499
come today contain a lot of topics

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:21,239
[Music]

00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:23,999
working as a fortunate today this is my

00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:26,599
daughter size and abilities were

00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,599
watering

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:37,970
[Applause]

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,970
