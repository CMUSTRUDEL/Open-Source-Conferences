Description: 
	Session ID: SFO17-207
Session Name: Understanding Real Time kernel - SFO17-207
Speaker: Alex Shi
Track: Kernel


★ Session Summary ★
Real Time kernel is out of linux kernel upstream for long time. It keep contributing much of key features into upstream, like high resolution timer, lockdep, thread irq, PI, ftrace, etc. The Linux foundation setup a group to merge it all into upstream.
 
 This session is going to review RT requirements, the block issue in upstream kernel, and the solution to fix them in RT. We also go through the current out of upstream RT code. Introduce the base stone of RT features: sleeping spin_lock. This session also covers the basic criteria of RT, the general testing tools.

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:29,010
the poverty Elise Foundation has our

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:37,350
arterial disease we are colleagues

00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:39,590
project I will introduce focusing on

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,509
policy are investing also tracing

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:47,150
because he's a very important feature of

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:57,479
the for the ology tuning and then the

00:01:47,150 --> 00:02:01,380
the main content is written in funny

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,610
we will see some resources in useful

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,610
oh hi

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,340
[Music]

[Music]

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:10,860
also some clothes sauce we can you can

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:16,350
get up cream check lots of them was here

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:23,070
and also include some dzifa of value

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:28,560
which currency a leaner also we can see

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:32,600
a muscle at home I use arm cortex-m also

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,600
some of them a

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,610
let's go talk to my slice

00:04:49,240 --> 00:05:01,090
rtl is currently the foundation own

00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:07,040
project as much elk are according to the

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:12,790
stream is color the man members of this

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,790
project is the leader

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:28,940
five posters Latinas Sebastian Granada

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:31,460
and Benedict also in the you know we

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:35,200
still have sweet super post and

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:50,930
currently spent some time on our Phoenix

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:55,220
Terry is very here currently the most of

00:05:50,930 --> 00:06:02,500
code party athletes is more team to ask

00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:07,610
me some famous one is also the

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:11,120
serving internal also we know the block

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:16,310
dependency of f-trains Falcon Crest also

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,100
I come from the algae project there's

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:23,390
still some something called I will come

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,930
now I can check on the party other

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:34,590
products for free

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:38,790
this is about 4000 more than 400 the

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:41,720
to the terrace all the lines the third

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,060
month apology party could have easily

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,930
sake

00:06:44,060 --> 00:07:03,150
despite who make the spin up next a

00:06:48,930 --> 00:07:08,090
merciful also preventable we we all know

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,840
in the kana we use IQ so to hope some

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,570
thank you

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:18,030
critical reading but now he's also

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:25,140
preempted by a local lock it also

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:28,040
possible not only of this but also they

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:35,580
are also a lot of optimization from the

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:40,070
severe memory so dark you see you pass

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,070
many bug fix or weeks

00:07:46,430 --> 00:08:07,640
we talked the Army's the moment in my

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:11,370
testing on the that is expelled the

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:14,790
maximum latency can be achieved less

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,870
than 200 micro second

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,340
you have businesses

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:25,650
[Music]

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:30,650
to do this testing videos are cut up we

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:33,570
must choose the RT for cross-linking the

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,779
the answers like the first one is

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,940
apparently not the only now issues in

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:43,080
the slope this means

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:46,770
no problemo and the second is a

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:53,940
volunteer is used for desktop the server

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:57,480
also use the this is a little bit more

00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:05,459
aggressive with the grab the volunteer

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:09,120
and also the RVT means the Tabasco is

00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:13,500
kind of between the low latency the

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:18,890
latency crap the default so Archie phone

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:24,230
is full of preventable the best of these

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,230
since week one three and four spinlock

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:32,600
in the art project we often leads to

00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,600
lots of tracing to find

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,910
[Music]

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,649
[Music]

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,419
[Music]

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,140
[Music]

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,610
[Music]

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:09,630
because the biggest problem is on this

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:14,640
schedule autonomy is between the two

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:21,870
actions is after trial record before the

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:27,030
schedule so we try to wake up and we get

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:30,830
models we get about 11 see the tasks a

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:33,829
schedule so it's caused a lot of time

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:38,589
because he is

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:43,550
I don't go to Berkeley house and

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:57,649
rewarding my life to open the country

00:11:43,550 --> 00:12:02,179
tries to see what happened next I will

00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:06,759
go through some of the reasons our girl

00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:14,839
is in encouragement I mean the current

00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:28,369
article and we can see memory devices

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:30,980
also somehow actually is the most

00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:39,230
importantly the our companies are the

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:39,810
deal is missing here I think is the most

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,890
easily

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,890
[Music]

00:12:49,270 --> 00:13:02,110
whew we also can see the last masses and

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,830
music you power the power that is issue

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,490
of mother hi on couch using one gig on

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:25,540
us and this is what we gonna Lucy

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:28,029
requests as I found Vicki but on the

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,890
other on the outside we can calculate

00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:38,230
for this requirement that the current

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:41,880
platform like x86 of our context a

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:44,950
context which need halkias

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,190
instructions and for one campus issues

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:54,550
means one that second for our

00:13:48,190 --> 00:14:00,029
instruction so hunkers I started as a my

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,029
class some of the Harvard in Iraq

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:15,820
so just time calls and he's one nautical

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:22,839
at least one among us again I mean a

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:28,440
hundred nanoseconds so consider this one

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,440
because non-sexual frequent is Max's

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:40,560
and father this is not the if you know

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:44,270
Sicily is who is $4 so absolutely if we

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:52,220
are give us some housing malignancy so

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:57,500
how to know how to achieve your maximum

00:14:52,220 --> 00:15:02,850
there are some solution form for this

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:08,760
the also talk a little bit about the CCO

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:15,330
isolation for details we can see some of

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:26,100
the isolation isolation where like even

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:31,290
you said and you also can use Isis if

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:37,280
you use in the wood line which can I

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:41,580
said this also there are some holes in

00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:47,040
some of the papers in start how isolate

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:49,640
the CPU how to reduce this cutie from

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,640
case ways

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:59,100
technical results for articles I thank

00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:04,200
you can pronounce some memories paste or

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:08,930
your article in some special even more

00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,930
delicate results for the party

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,370
second hardware is in the memory yeah

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:29,920
whenever you because here I told the

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:34,320
memory from the software side we can we

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,540
can see see if I all campaigns in pain

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:42,120
the very petty plan may cost a lot of

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:45,640
time if your system is using a slave

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:52,480
because noticed on your hard disk that's

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:59,920
also called also time and if you asked

00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:06,220
has gone a lot ok so the current program

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:11,770
here is from the layer 3 allocate memory

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:18,850
for you can use the slot for the best

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:23,950
defragment the sir why is your outside

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:30,570
the action column it is English article

00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:30,570
now the reduce the penalties law 3

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:50,150
then we talk about devices also the

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:53,800
issue the issue because the customer

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:59,480
might beat us some devices may hold

00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:03,559
given passed along time they interaction

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,350
interaction we can see this from the

00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,600
different side for some of the

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:15,530
architecture you may you may don't want

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:20,410
the this has being trapped by some from

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:24,350
devices on the outside if the interrupt

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:27,770
you want you like the network you won't

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:39,700
get a response maybe less interruption

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:41,380
you want to so for the heart attack in

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:50,090
[Music]

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:55,100
the drop that means I'm not really into

00:18:50,090 --> 00:19:00,500
canals and a given response as time you

00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:06,140
want a very sharp in the software we can

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:11,030
become fun submarine 12 was designed so

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:13,970
this addition we are looking already

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:19,429
broke a multi-layer is less in fact if

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:23,620
you wanted the first so that is the

00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,620
third infraction is already morning

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:34,930
identity beacon people's is try only

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,930
priority and security

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:45,830
so with this unlucky Jesus give us

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:50,260
health as we can choice some involved

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,260
that's we perform and give high priority

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:59,990
and there's some low level of priority

00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:19,210
pre-installed and we talk about food

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:19,210
desirable these resources that thank you

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:49,049
I have the

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,859
[Music]

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,000
[Music]

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,559
[Music]

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,200
the samosa

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,200
I point out the city

00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,959
[Music]

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:59,710
so we start we have been about a

00:22:49,840 --> 00:23:07,270
software issue skill cost Oh kevie flash

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:12,120
and flash and political reveal how do we

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:16,420
help optimize this kind of situation

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:22,270
with all the products see currently we

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:26,830
have five home or on roaming deadline we

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:37,120
can give us real-time tasks Moriarty

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:41,680
that's kind of but now we have the this

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,750
finale is suitable so it's cause so the

00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,410
no one has to make be prevented each

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,380
other

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:55,050
let's look in extra assistant board of

00:23:47,380 --> 00:24:01,530
the college also the cold hot cold case

00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:01,530
so in the article out there does

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:35,200
that means this column is already in the

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:37,680
column also even on the ex-facta

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,680
software

00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:54,960
finally we get maybe the most important

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:54,960
part for the article as the best film

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:07,870
for the to Bob for the nominal is Enoch

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:12,480
may is a model system will always has

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:17,559
the Marco sister maybe somehow this kill

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,960
us with unspeaking lock that's the

00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:26,410
problem

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:34,120
so the Salman al-farsi article is back

00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:41,100
you know also the are also different

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:41,100
that's my inspired by our communities

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,279
[Music]

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:54,230
after it has may I may I talk a little

00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:57,710
more about the ultimate accidents forces

00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:03,020
to resolve the pre-op convention also

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:10,640
the true empty inherent but they are can

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:13,940
see if a civil wars the land of getting

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:20,300
to sleep stingers this has also said

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:27,040
migration desirable so we can think

00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:31,840
about if the vibration is enable of us

00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,840
sweet enough Jesus okay

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,080
I'm actually from the functional side of

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:42,230
the city

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,320
migration is about we don't need resolve

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:51,940
it can be enabled but you can seek me

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:58,550
the most was issue this is maybe elderly

00:26:51,940 --> 00:27:04,030
almost view which on the same my pink on

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:04,030
the same view actually because the

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:14,750
because all of the in our tasks which

00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:18,380
can which is is okay to sleep on these

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:25,310
things you know

00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:31,700
the other issue is with our practice you

00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:36,440
know maybe the most pre most preempted

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:42,620
past finishes and then the constant the

00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:46,940
next the next part so if the city all

00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:50,960
the tasks so you understand CQ is this

00:27:46,940 --> 00:28:01,180
called the bonus issue because the case

00:27:50,960 --> 00:28:10,570
is called we talk about the Orthodox

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:14,650
country the other change is us aluminum

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,650
race bias

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:29,349
you to replace the other block

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,349
[Music]

00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,650
[Music]

00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:38,360
the task a has the highest power and has

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:56,830
to be the same so the is know most

00:29:38,360 --> 00:30:00,830
winners the understand the in custody is

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:04,810
technology and because is has a higher

00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,810
promotion see

00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:19,890
fantasy so because he didn't finish

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:24,660
because it is still hopeful of what so

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:34,260
this year the result is the task a which

00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:37,710
has the highest priority in these so

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:41,370
that is a priority invention we can see

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:54,020
the result is the highest priority task

00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:57,660
I was and there are many solution in the

00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:05,190
country computer industry but Artemis

00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:18,050
Club we use chronology in her in the

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:25,140
architects the so if in this situation

00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:30,630
if C was created by B because she holds

00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:41,820
the lock which ended so the solution is

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:47,840
we can increase the priority of Z P

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,840
cannot prevent C so C can be

00:31:48,580 --> 00:32:03,060
thanks a lot so that is one of the

00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:03,060
protein curve this this chair shows

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,150
[Music]

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:24,250
faith the faith has the high score and

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:32,860
your husband teeth inside into the

00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:41,710
blockchain part of the sea has the most

00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:45,370
higher regard so because if so thousand

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:48,520
give the previous ones for the house

00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:51,360
sister right because it is the highest

00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:56,080
priority is the most important artifacts

00:32:51,360 --> 00:33:01,240
the social is we do all of the reversal

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:05,970
tasks with the central geology so the

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,970
lover earth tasks in the hood

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,299
this life

00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:38,160
after we saw settings and currently the

00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:40,770
are the other group of trees here for

00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:45,870
the article weekly the second one is is

00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:54,270
it all week because expansion on the out

00:33:45,870 --> 00:34:01,020
here it's not so all of the another is

00:33:54,270 --> 00:34:04,290
the algae may be also some about

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:08,340
investing in Southeast you can find from

00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:11,120
mineral calls those those parts would

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,120
enhance by

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,469
[Music]

00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:40,510
so the summary the RTO project agrees

00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:44,389
the package is any card I'll see Archie

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:47,929
means athlete actual beginning to the

00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:56,270
country only two years three years

00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:59,329
before as in his 2015 it is advance in

00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:02,410
order to achieve this target and make

00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:08,140
all calling transferring in two years

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:08,140
you know if a person is our philosophy

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,279
the second is corrosion is fallacious

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:22,180
coupon I the most important point

00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:22,180
I seen in me out of stream

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,569
also it's a result of learning Spanish

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,709
[Music]

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:46,749
