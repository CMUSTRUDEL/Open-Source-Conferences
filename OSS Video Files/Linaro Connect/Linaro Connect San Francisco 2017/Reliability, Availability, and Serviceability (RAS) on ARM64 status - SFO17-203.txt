[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:34,629
I'm signing it 19 from rehab

00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:41,090
in a 14 15 minute spray and me will

00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:44,330
introduce the rest for based on um be a

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:49,190
residential SBI and then security in

00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:53,000
position and idea so rest is not a new

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:58,970
pocket here and I ran a similar session

00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,420
in Lhasa enact but every time I had a

00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:12,200
walk-in home rest secretary condition

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:15,680
and so I so but right now we have a

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,899
clear view of you know handling data

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,780
passes we also have something have some

00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:27,259
prototype to so possible I will break

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,570
through the introduction of redress

00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,310
pretty quickly because I guess most

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,950
people in this room

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,920
heard about last and certainly I will

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,590
talk about how and software architecture

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:45,810
rest like residential

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:51,810
Familia PI API papal and as the young

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:55,270
then spray will introduce Eman and

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,870
security petition security information

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,720
manager then I will give you a big

00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,210
picture of her alive solution of Rome

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,770
high error handling which we are working

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,940
on is basically about how to report

00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:16,450
non-fatal

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:19,180
uncorrect error from how I eat we still

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,959
have time to pray we're sure sure a demo

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,540
of this prototype again I will give you

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:34,200
a standard state the reports state

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:36,370
update in the government ran for rest so

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,420
so here we go

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:43,900
let's start with brief introduction of

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:47,500
brass so what is service reliability

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:53,410
around is the related the sweet cap

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:57,970
koh-lanta mega of rest we use history as

00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:02,110
a specter to measure that if the system

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,269
and live love and correct and also

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:09,780
mention about the dress artificial

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:15,420
primarily primary care about the air

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:18,430
produced by how it can detect a

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,260
character arrow before causing failure

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:26,640
by analyzing error in the data the

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:30,940
following component can be predict in

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:35,079
identified they also it also allowed us

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:37,959
to precise precise replacement precise

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:42,489
repressor fairly calm during the

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:45,489
scheduled maintenance so why us is so

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,010
important because enterprise system

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:50,879
often

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:55,620
mission critical service so anterior

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:59,730
even if service will impact the impact

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:03,180
the customers business and reputation in

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:07,019
the real world we would have avoid power

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,769
port because that always goes to product

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:14,609
always called a server in he always

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:17,699
existed in his notes general in check of

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:20,519
the not only generate interview time are

00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:25,889
also triggered in the wrong time

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:29,340
so even MIT the failure in time is very

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:32,460
small number but the number of device in

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,919
the enterprise systems very large so we

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:40,680
can't avoid it we we have to maintain

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:44,340
this datacenter very well so Islam we're

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,340
really helpful is the rest really how so

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:51,810
we all know is important but we also

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,750
need some evidence to support to prove

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:59,190
that so I found a cave online which is

00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:04,229
sorry report about the event error data

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:11,550
and analysis of Google Day Center there

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:15,120
are some important conclusion so the the

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:19,380
incident of memory error in the range of

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,280
error stage across the different day are

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:26,490
much higher than previous report so

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:30,560
maybe some people cactus on machine just

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,760
one machine say ok this this error very

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,150
no

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,730
when opening a field the rate of them

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,820
error is really low but actually the

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,510
real death sentence is more higher than

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:49,740
our expect so if you want some data you

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:52,620
want some real data about google Tech

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:59,490
Center you can try to download his paper

00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:02,070
is this table online so another crucians

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,340
memory stroke-related

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:08,400
that means the error will often happen

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,420
in the same place so maybe this thing

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,850
has some character arrow and then the in

00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:19,530
descending the track corrected error

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:23,070
will occur again and again you know near

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:25,830
future the incorrect area will innocent

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:29,610
people that possibility of land in much

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:34,250
higher much higher in the same prints

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:38,550
so the error rate not unlikely to be

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:42,570
donated by software error so maybe use

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:45,630
of a wrong is an error but the most

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:49,920
violent possibility is about how I know

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:54,690
your software look so what is the

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,380
benefit from from ECC signal single bit

00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:01,680
error should be to be corrected in to

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,580
avoid the multi video from the very

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:09,960
beginning then the statistical data of

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,400
the LV reference for maintenance should

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,970
reduce the cost of

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,020
unscheduled service outage so why I'm

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,790
talking about

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:26,010
because the ECC is a basic function in

00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:29,760
less so why is we don't have rest in the

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:33,450
enterprise cell so okay I just wish you

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:36,690
good luck because okay you can put is

00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:40,640
common in your code and say okay this

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,640
way I won't find herself

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:51,420
also there's another joke in China the

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:58,770
Emperor Yong Chun okay DP ha

00:07:51,420 --> 00:08:03,450
so not joking time so let's do a quick

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:05,880
review of arrest history here press is

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:10,320
not a new stuff it already exists it

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:14,670
already used on x86 for a long time I

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:20,520
see see see in memory intro is original

00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:24,680
rests implement mca which is memory

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:29,460
memory check

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:32,720
machine architecture in a chip to

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:39,530
simplify in integrated mechanism of

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:43,830
repair include as NS are which is which

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,340
contain the error info for CPU and

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:50,130
memory

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:53,400
it also includes MCE to signal to signal

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:57,990
detection of our character machine check

00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:03,120
error but they are they are bound with

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:05,600
all the power x86 specification aspect

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,600
okay

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,720
so but we also have some architecture

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:26,380
independent mechanism for 4x4 pcre we

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,580
have a ADR to report in the Linux kernel

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:34,780
we have we have an impact driver we have

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:39,870
a it actor from what to report error

00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,870
info information to the user space so

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:48,250
through a user space but it's inspected

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:52,780
power directly it's nowhere it's not a

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:57,010
woman framework for all all for a device

00:09:52,780 --> 00:10:00,040
all the owners key arguments or

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:03,400
something is just really registered

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,710
directly so it's not very very easy to

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:10,540
use info well we are we use firmware

00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,000
first mechanism we can use that with

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,960
only an x86 we can use that for my first

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,170
weekend we don't use that this is also

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:25,740
okay it's also we you also need a

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,740
unified and ACPI support having a TI

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:36,260
okay after a quick introduction of

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:41,150
restless folks on a resume as before

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:44,840
from from now I start to introduce how

00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:49,160
our software component in grass only

00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:52,060
acts upon the length introduced to what

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:57,830
we are we are doing the prototype of

00:10:52,060 --> 00:11:04,940
firmware first air for rest for rest

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:07,390
upon as before we have our PA with year

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,930
two years three and verse translation

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:16,330
security extension we also meet Equus

00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:21,020
tree which has some advanced advanced

00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:26,920
feature for interactive management and

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:31,430
most of most importantly in in a latest

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:38,660
EA we a on choose back without rest

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:47,030
extension as mandatory extension but in

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:49,940
LV a0 and a1 is to be optional so what

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:54,220
is service extension if you look like a

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:59,930
priority with record deal with air

00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:04,810
product produced from how the howl for

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:10,730
in Maryland include sweetheart

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:13,850
sweetheart corrected data concerning its

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:18,290
the totally how a man isn't to make sure

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:23,210
the practice data could be the hacker

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,420
stop it and we stopped in the new in a

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:28,740
new

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,560
structure called ESP which means arrow

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:37,459
synchronize a synchronization manner

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:42,120
banger a group of a group of witches for

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:49,130
recording error - tripping tracking the

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:52,110
assess and featuring firm and the differ

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:59,579
interactive spatial register which what

00:12:52,110 --> 00:13:04,800
which the ESP so let's add each time

00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:07,500
about ESP yesterday so it's a wonderful

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,790
one wonderful important part of the res

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:16,550
extension by the help of ESP software

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:20,910
can be isolated the Soviet an isolated

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:24,360
location of error between the between

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:27,930
the ESP and agree with ESP it could use

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:33,660
in Oh X to be using OS well at least

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:38,399
execute evil SE SEI which is used for

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,649
reporting and synchronized error is a

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,529
month

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:49,290
sei will be generated in other words the

00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:53,010
info of error exception will be pending

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:58,560
in di SR which is not registered for

00:13:53,010 --> 00:14:04,890
rest rest attention one more rest

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:07,459
ESP is for our MC tonight error the

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:10,170
error of the West extension reaches

00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:11,470
resistor R another important part of

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,200
erratic

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:18,490
it helped full well to collective error

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:22,600
information control and so interrupter

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:27,430
exception in in a computer configuration

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:30,340
of restaurant for resthouse richest has

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,650
system viewed and odd and also has the

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,290
memory review I think the most of

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:39,090
highway work for the device we will use

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,090
the memory Matthew

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:48,900
so let's the I see a brief summary for

00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:53,230
for res extension so ESP is help us to

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:56,440
help us to local area so press attention

00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:02,490
register have provider error information

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:06,180
and control the interactive by farewell

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:09,670
so what is your benefit length

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:14,530
recitation bring to us actually in life

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:17,560
MC is Lyman CA in simple if simplify and

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:22,030
interprets the Magnusson of report

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:31,920
reporting error in standardized

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:35,920
interface between power and knowledge

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,280
start talking about a software okay as

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,010
before we are using we are using

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,310
firmware first error handling which

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,840
requires standard interface between

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,950
multi software and :

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:53,860
before we dig into each component of

00:15:49,950 --> 00:16:00,150
software architecture allowed me to just

00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:01,690
show overview of all rests components so

00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:07,200
that's all

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,200
all of component about grass you can see

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:53,250
you can see a yellow switch 3 which is

00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:53,250
unified and you also meet API and driver

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:20,620
uses face and UEFI so well

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:22,500
inclusive of you ha you put in Egypt ps3

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,890
what is is

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,540
years three wrong time it includes its

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:33,550
exception handling and then dispatcher

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:37,450
SPN dispatcher it can go with other four

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:40,810
well UEFI is forward forward

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:44,560
interface between the perform and

00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:51,030
operation system only happy for its what

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:56,050
with untrackable well as ER 3 3 in gyros

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:59,620
so again now i we have gone through

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:03,350
power forward and so interface but now

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:07,310
how the how to pasture air

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:11,570
infer from follower to OS since we are

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:17,030
using a CPI of massive on absolute for

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:20,480
now so we are using ATM we have we have

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,790
made some introduction in recession of

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,560
blaster connect so let's just go

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:29,480
straight very quickly

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:33,410
API provided means for the prom to pass

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:38,450
error from for well to OST included for

00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:41,870
different people first of all I would

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:44,180
like to I will introduce the hassle

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,150
table which is most important one what

00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:51,920
which is what we are working on is

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:55,660
Heather in the Rafael and back table

00:18:51,920 --> 00:19:00,440
Yakut ago is just pass the information

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:03,230
from the last crash so once once machine

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,620
get some very critical error and the

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:11,690
system has had to be rebooted

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:13,910
so the follower will stop the air into

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:17,060
some place and then with system compact

00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:23,240
it will pull information into some some

00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:26,020
secure area and the OS can read it when

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,820
of in a boot time or maybe in later

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,970
because you know right now Heather

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:36,290
always want to help you system when you

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:40,250
go down in some error data to be

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:43,400
analysis analysis and used to active

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:50,390
machine so we were each to secure part

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:53,330
infer also so yeah it is is safe in the

00:19:50,390 --> 00:20:00,200
error error log into persistent storage

00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:04,570
and inject a inj is the API framework

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,570
has things for a VPN testing

00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:17,159
okay once we go the wrong tire air we

00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:20,129
can we can use the hassle to like that

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:23,279
always know how to handle it has the

00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:28,320
provider key import about once we have

00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:32,070
error how the firmware chica OS where is

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,089
a record and how to release the memory

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:40,649
of record the hat in hand we have

00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:43,979
several stock able to pass the air soft

00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:52,440
information for young people we care

00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:56,849
about GE sterl GH p SB - mostly we will

00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:04,369
use this structure to pass arrows for

00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:08,549
infant to us - OS so particle I just

00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:11,039
introduced just manages now in he used

00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:14,399
to record arrow in emergency like OS

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:18,330
Cresta once what system go down we will

00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:23,669
get get an error info with a system

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:28,710
compare again but but provider teams of

00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:35,609
Arab region so the arrow bot is ferment

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:40,379
by four well in sepia superb format this

00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:44,820
is described in us unified aspect from

00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:48,690
the strength destructor of seeker we you

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:52,019
may see that it can be put all kind of

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:55,710
error we could think of so that's the

00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:58,399
advantage of of using Yui an API and

00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,399
seeker

00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:07,820
the rest of the blue cable is yes t a

00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:11,509
ninja yes he is the hombre operation

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:14,320
extractor which provide necessary info

00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:18,859
to communicate with on bond assistant

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:23,629
persistent storage for error recording

00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:29,919
and engine is operation as extractor we

00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:36,409
wish which provide a generic interface

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:40,969
then OS can inject a fake our air for

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:45,559
rest testing is the postponed use case

00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:48,320
is using us system advanced interface to

00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:53,320
talk to engine and injured with inter

00:22:48,320 --> 00:23:00,829
table driver will talk to the phone well

00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:03,769
to face some errors our air so now in

00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:08,149
fact what we have talked about our

00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:13,849
support of grass and also API let's move

00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:16,759
to the software and we are people trying

00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:22,869
to reuse from well first a magnet a

00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:26,419
party OS but OS also can decide which

00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:29,599
signal event which this the event you

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:33,879
could want to handle and which just not

00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:37,549
so so software delegate is exception

00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:42,100
interface is interface between the

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:45,639
firmware in OS phone for reducing

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:51,250
not notifying and so assist an event

00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:52,720
using SMC and maybe if we use in a

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:57,279
virtualization we're using

00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:00,639
virtualization we use HPC but is not

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:05,139
just for for rats it also can be used in

00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:11,289
department so that's not Janata common

00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:14,679
usage in in FBI so you can download SBI

00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:16,929
facto mind it has been released but in a

00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:22,120
lot larger connect it happen big release

00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:25,600
but now is you can download it so for

00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:30,009
now we have introduced all all men

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:35,500
component we we we need to we need in

00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:38,679
rats we can we can introduce the proton

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:42,399
solution for rest and arena and but

00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:46,210
before that let's invite spray to

00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:55,990
introduce basical mechanism in improv

00:24:46,210 --> 00:25:03,399
part which he is working on hello I work

00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:06,700
for ADT you know so as you mentioned we

00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:08,830
are what we are doing we are actually

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,279
defining the second partition interface

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:14,500
between mediate to paste immensity of

00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:17,450
partition security

00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,640
I am they've been relaxed at the on post

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,710
at Congress basically the city of

00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:26,720
partition manager is running Indian

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:30,790
Sigma we are implementing the secretary

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,770
we are also defining we got the STI

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:36,800
notification added to a CPR six-foot-six

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,870
pointless specification we are

00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,110
implementing this interfaces to

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:46,880
demonstrate beneath the prototype to

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:49,010
demonstrate the DMC and CPU errors using

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,630
the former first handling method and

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,360
also demonstrate the use of smart

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,390
extensions and thanks to my friend of

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,020
the rhenium and their sports we are kind

00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,020
of carrying that

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:10,270
so what is the management moon so

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,140
basically we are using management mode

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:17,890
as a secure partition which runs

00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:23,110
insecure 0 it's isolated from secure l1

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:26,590
and l3 basically implements the

00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:29,140
management functions it is just one way

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:33,730
of doing it the car fixed virtual

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:36,880
platform in some other partner use cases

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:39,000
if the errors may be hundred offloaded

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,549
to four processes

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,690
so it basically uses the existing it

00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:51,399
through we are kind of up streaming

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:54,520
standard on and on package to larger

00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:57,669
elements so the communication to the

00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,520
securio management partition is using

00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:03,640
the using an SMC it's called a memo

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:06,909
communicate its there and try

00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:11,049
commercialization here P I volume four

00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:15,490
SMM specification he I fortune 1.51

00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:19,720
dater partition is actually managed by

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:22,200
Doncaster convert all the information

00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,779
needed for the secular partition

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,230
resources described in BL three one

00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:31,659
platform for a farmer a farmer basically

00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:38,220
how much space it means the stock face

00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:40,750
the he pays so the main aim of the

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,029
management mode is to minimize the code

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,720
family in year three and then we get

00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,720
most of it

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:53,919
but it may not be the case but partner

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:58,500
use cases because those may be out

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,500
dormant through the process

00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:08,650
okay secure partition manager runs lvl 3

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:12,130
1 it basically initializes the partition

00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:15,900
and it relieves the SMC's received from

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:20,700
the normal world to the management mode

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:23,799
secured portion and the secure partition

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,150
architecture itself is being done by

00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:30,780
auction here if you have any questions

00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,780
feel free to contact

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:50,350
okay so we are using the station manager

00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:50,350
it's using the

00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,560
the Earth's angles or the base

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,710
today it's the singular button

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:55,220
now for the complete data flow I give

00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,220
back my cue

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,090
okay

00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:17,440
now we have we have introduced all the

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:27,460
necessary input of grass before so

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:30,910
that's and system boots from year one

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,640
and you know you know put from year one

00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:37,179
which is her room and then beer one

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:42,040
loved hero to and bureaus to go rest of

00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:45,970
the rest of the images are heroes three

00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:49,929
one two three and and cool from the ps3

00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:55,049
1 to p sv 2 and to the UEFI right

00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:59,260
so unify what we put into the UEFI

00:30:55,049 --> 00:31:07,080
unified press home Trevor

00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:10,780
well crack the it will cry be the

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,080
primary security security punishing

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:19,570
mention which is the bureau three to

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,790
four arrow sauce info so secure

00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:28,890
conditioning he mentioned with an arrow

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:28,890
salt info back to the UEFI UV he will

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:43,960
unify and the UDF I will mapping the

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:45,980
memory and also will mention the metal

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:51,769
or mark

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:55,630
our memory for you tell you to use also

00:31:51,769 --> 00:32:00,049
it will pass take the half the table

00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:02,510
have suitable for OS and once OS star

00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:06,980
star running the half the driver will

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:11,840
scan learn as the table to religious it

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:14,149
was scanner as people in reaches hand

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:20,630
around for for error

00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:26,500
hello me so once the uncharacterized the

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:35,539
event we are new to the ps3 ps3 which is

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:38,600
secured partition manager once the inter

00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:41,690
Octavia external interrupts in res

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:45,200
expansion in what occurred will the

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:48,700
arrow will trigger the security policy

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:54,200
manager and security punishment manager

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:58,929
were events arrest to arrest error

00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:07,299
handling in the secure gyros year on 0

00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:12,110
so you will manage well and if the

00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:14,659
secured condition images will create the

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:18,080
speaker broke which is air on

00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:20,590
information by the info from graphics

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,590
engine

00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,210
security commission management know

00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:31,780
after left once we get all an error

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:36,309
information here from reference tension

00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:42,460
we transfer from Russia attention to the

00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:45,900
zipper problem and then transfer and

00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:52,770
then secure commission manage a whale

00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:58,350
notify notify lies SBI to call the

00:33:52,770 --> 00:34:02,040
correspond oh s richest we resist this

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:05,980
earlier and then now what occurred we

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:11,500
prepare the error Brock we will not call

00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:14,950
this header Oh a scale of 0 then our

00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:18,460
scanner secret brought by error by eros

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:22,030
station edges which is in the hostel

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:26,830
table and assessing the error trying to

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:29,409
recover and report error event so after

00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:32,760
that which we call the driver get

00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:37,389
information from here and then it will

00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:43,000
reach the event and I couldn't know it

00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:45,490
eventually the rest demon will get

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,710
information from anywhere so let's

00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:51,700
measure whole basis for the character in

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,600
uncorrect

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:59,660
air

00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:08,860
we are working on so let's on a detail

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:08,860
of left of that temperature so

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:18,380
so right now she pretty will show the

00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:20,440
demo about the diamonds I'm talking

00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,440
about

00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,950
the screen yeah

00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,750
a lot of times walking into life

00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:17,869
this is basically an extension of the

00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:33,890
data filled with 4xp

00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:33,890
basically demonstrates partial manager

00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:48,770
management center partition where the

00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:56,640
information from the record super

00:36:48,770 --> 00:37:02,400
excreted and secured partition manager

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:07,080
process to be I to modify the worse the

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,720
was this one file code every star common

00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:13,350
perform error record

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,950
just by Christie I've stated that by

00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,950
using their

00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,940
it's passed on through the second

00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:47,940
partition

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,750
the secret for the memory after painful

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,750
memory

00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,620
so house

00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,790
is

00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:59,400
for probably a little table from this

00:38:52,259 --> 00:39:09,109
one actually this day was so what is

00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:09,109
happening is SPI here this is the

00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:32,410
yeah kind of

00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,400
and excusing guys

00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:31,360
so so just now you can see two windows

00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:38,470
window so it's pretty just demonstrate

00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:43,890
the whole day control one once in Egypt

00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:51,610
air memory so once we get an error and

00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:56,230
he will control this the intellectual

00:40:51,610 --> 00:41:04,660
will will trigger the security manager

00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:08,640
and then route the interaction through

00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:12,190
year three to LaPierre e2 which is the

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,330
circulation will prepare error

00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:19,630
later for force OS so you can see

00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:23,170
another random here which leaves this

00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:26,500
this is the output from here and a big

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:30,690
video is output from Colonel that's the

00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,690
demonstration the demo chest

00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:43,280
so okay so we are working on this the

00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:51,200
whole solution in a prototype solution

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:56,570
of error handling for right now I would

00:41:51,200 --> 00:42:01,970
I will stay tuned in future plan for

00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:05,180
this so currently we have finished it

00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:08,150
some we have some progress other

00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:13,760
engineers for how the other engineers

00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:20,660
who are working on equity the letting me

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:25,220
is is he running on qmu Westpac has been

00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:27,589
released since last night in a large

00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:30,650
connected they have a degree is right so

00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:31,700
we're now we can download is Thomas

00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:36,520
SPECT

00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:40,390
oh man and for fun well FBI FBI

00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:45,170
specifications in released a stake see I

00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:49,490
added as air as how our error

00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:57,730
notification type this has been an

00:42:49,490 --> 00:43:01,220
intruder hdpi 6.2 Linux SPI client

00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:04,760
implementation has been hoped we swim

00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,920
swim close several days ago so you can

00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:13,070
you can check these two link once you

00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:18,410
download this and then a CPSC is support

00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:26,630
for SDI has been upstream be bothering

00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:29,410
us so you also can get some get some

00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:34,260
code from github including SPI

00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:38,700
dispatcher in framework for managing

00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:44,040
interactive heteronomy near PLC for from

00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:48,900
cone API can be enabled in a athlete or

00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:54,000
a memory memory figure support has been

00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:58,040
merged what we are good is right now we

00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:06,540
are working on the demo working on the

00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:09,990
solution separate just jealous for ultra

00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:14,460
well simplify our interactive heteroatom

00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:20,640
for perform halls we are signified error

00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:26,150
errors in Toronto in doheny also rest

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:28,230
extension serve all if in time like ESP

00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:31,860
rest rest

00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:37,530
Arabic or driver we are working on less

00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:41,820
and less what I what I'm working on is I

00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:45,510
try to create a driver to create the

00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:50,040
cast table under this is under the

00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:56,790
runner so I also try to create a library

00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:59,790
for create H API seeker see / - together

00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:06,120
information from rest extension general

00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:10,470
simple error so the prototype secrets

00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:13,830
shown us is on a quickie I'm working on

00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:18,210
a prototype on killing you which other

00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:20,040
people can can use that is totally under

00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:25,310
sauce and

00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:32,590
I have wire weekly page in our wiki

00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:34,790
and you can find it in Canadian tent for

00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:39,860
motorization motorizing

00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:45,040
SP is on the dorama so what we are going

00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:50,950
to do is support the rest expansion and

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:57,170
the other recipe our API table by pops

00:45:50,950 --> 00:46:01,600
IIT in Japan in Japan incrementation we

00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:06,520
also try to try to get a real house to

00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:12,680
taxes which improve it be a point to

00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:18,820
increasing so thank you very much for

00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:31,550
these guys helped own this place lat

00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:33,470
Thank You errors here so you have a

00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:35,330
severe memory error you mean everyone

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:40,520
get back here oh it's your OS they don't

00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:43,700
go under you're right so Oh what happens

00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:47,420
with the errors that may prevent your

00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:53,060
actual architecture from running so this

00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:56,630
first work for so once the error

00:46:53,060 --> 00:47:01,970
occurred is very fatal right the killer

00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:06,770
OS but we hope who was still roaming or

00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:10,130
maybe ENC killer ami so he can say the

00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,590
owner contacts all error information

00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:15,200
into somewhere and maybe he said

00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:16,820
persistent event every person it may be

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,590
certain position storage

00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:24,860
so when system come back the first the

00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:27,340
first opponent info well we'll get all

00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:30,850
the information back to the memory and

00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,850
the kernel

00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:20,190
what percentage how would you rate our

00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:23,839
support versus x86 I need to send it's

00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:23,839
40% 90

00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:34,600
a tsunami comes in yet but if we want to

00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,600
relate

00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:47,469
okay so you

00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:00,710
the Machine reboots indicator

00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:10,970
question has the table is replicator

00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,970
machine crashes an experiment

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:17,529
it's walking and learning community or

00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,529
city

00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:26,770
I think we will get information in when

00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:30,730
we crash and the PNC maybe these

00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:36,280
functions is increment by EMC or maybe

00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:39,750
is PI by four well we have a design this

00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:43,020
is under development all of this

00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:46,360
dysfunction is finished by Colonel but

00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:53,200
we still need a firmer support our

00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:57,640
support so it's under the right yeah yes

00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:04,080
so they're actually initiated by the

00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:04,080
current perspective the firmware the

00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:12,160
their the kernel supposing attach your

00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:15,670
old and commissions to anyone has to

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:21,840
them there's you know there's a positive

00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:21,840
terminal which which today

00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:27,070
so if you've any specific look but the

00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,950
birds shouldn't be only generated firm

00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:33,250
educators or if there's a watchdog said

00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:34,840
so so keep you know in cases where you

00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:39,930
got a bird getting have an opportunity

00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,930
to get an answer your question yes

00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,790
time's up thank you

00:50:55,430 --> 00:51:04,199
[Applause]
