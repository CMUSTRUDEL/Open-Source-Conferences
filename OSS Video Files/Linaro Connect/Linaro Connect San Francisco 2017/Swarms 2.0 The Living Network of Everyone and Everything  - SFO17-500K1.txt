	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
five years ago I attended a very

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,130
inspiring keynote by Professor Yong

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,940
Robbie

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,700
the vision was connecting IOT sensors

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,540
like bees in this world fast forward

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,970
five years this warm OS is for real and

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,140
there are even people prototyping it on

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,420
96 boards so what's next young Robbie is

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,869
distinguished professor at the

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,609
University of California Berkeley and

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,769
funding director of the Berkeley

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:42,480
Wireless Research Center please welcome

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:45,899
young Robbie Thank You Andrea good

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,059
morning I heard you had a great week

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,579
already and an interesting party so I'm

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,289
gonna hope that I with my presentation I

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,789
can wake you up a little bit again and I

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,129
basically make our last day of the

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,539
conference very enjoyable so I'm going

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,039
to talk about swarms I'm gonna talk a

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,190
little bit about a little bit about the

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,150
past the present but primarily I'm gonna

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,450
look forward to the future so if you

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,490
look at i/o T sensor nets and so on so

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,810
forth is something that we Umberto we

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,260
have been playing around it for quite a

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,229
while

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,659
it was around 1995 that one of my

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,930
colleagues Chris Pfister invented this

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,930
terms Mar dust the idea that I actually

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,390
could build a complete sensor combined

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,549
with processing wireless interface and

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,640
energy harvesting in something that

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,970
would be about a cubic millimeter and be

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,100
able to put them everywhere since then

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,049
we've been building on an agenda that

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,939
basically has been trying to make this

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,159
thing happen

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,200
we have built tiny little Wireless notes

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,600
about 10 years ago

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,350
tiny oh as an operating system for

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,320
sensor nodes open w's and we had a

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,020
center formed citrus that looked at

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,780
societal networks the impact of sensors

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,780
and their networks monetary anti-death

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,439
on a variety of societal topics but

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,690
ultimately this one now you may ask

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,690
yourself why a swarm

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,140
there's a couple of reasons if you look

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,240
at the landscape today and you read to

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,660
the press you will find a whole variety

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,170
of things that ultimately describe the

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:29,440
same you have IOT which is a very

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,660
consumer oriented perspective we had

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,410
Cisco had a smart or IBM had a smarter

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,230
planet industry 4.0 the industrial

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,600
internet T sensors internet of

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,610
everything they're all basically point

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,730
to the capability of putting sensors

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:49,090
down connect them process them and do

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,100
something with that information so to

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,830
kind of basically capture the whole of

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:58,390
it I called it this one and I'll tell

00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,580
you why we realized actually about ten

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,890
years ago that indeed if this is

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,170
happening if we are starting to deploy

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,850
many many sensors connected to a

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,010
wireless network we're gonna change

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,410
frontal fundamentally the IT platform is

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,720
number one and number two we're gonna

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,500
change the way the world basically

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,540
interacts with the cyber world so and

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,209
indeed what you have seen emerging now

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,980
is a triple-a a platform where on one

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,700
side you have the cloud we're all

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,010
competing is you have the mobiles and

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,110
the edge points that basically surround

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,720
it and then there's many many many many

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,520
many devices that collect information

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,000
send it them and ultimately do something

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,010
with it

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,440
now if you look at the numbers they're

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,959
staggering you have millions hundreds of

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,850
millions of processors in the cloud you

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,519
have with every year we sell billion of

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,810
mobile devices but the potential of

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,610
those sensors is basically in the

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,790
trillions if you basically look at it a

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:59,140
thousand sensors per person on earth and

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,910
that's happening so this is what I call

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,920
the swarm the capability of deploying

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,620
trillions of connected devices and as I

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,650
said this is changing the way we run our

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,330
world right now suddenly we have a wide

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,580
bandwidth connection between the

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,620
physical world and the cyber world or

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,169
between the biological world in the

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,289
cyber world so cyber physical systems is

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:22,840
another term that basically covers this

00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:25,090
so this is all great but to make it

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,960
happen you really need to overcome a

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,180
bunch of barrier

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,190
barriers between industry disciplines

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,960
barriers between standards barriers

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,639
between platforms all those type of

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,550
things

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,810
and that's why we started swarm lap 1.0

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,780
the whole goal was really to create an

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,210
open and universal platform that

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,220
basically considers sensors as basically

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,830
something surrounds me and that I be

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,470
able to capture harvest and use for

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,419
creating interesting things and that

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,599
really requires this open Universal

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,819
platforms to create that and help us to

00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,380
distribute exciting application nobody

00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,900
has ever thought about that's what open

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,380
platforms do they are label people to

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:08,080
come up with new ideas so that was about

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,110
seven years ago and since then we've

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,910
been doing a variety of things and I

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,849
will talk about a couple of them swarm

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,560
abstractions and infrastructure we've

00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:19,930
been trying to figure out how to make

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,669
the swarm grow rep rapidly enabling that

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,819
capability put in the hands of everyone

00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,740
I call it crowdsourcing this one we have

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,539
developed special technologies spend

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,180
sensor technology and so on so forth and

00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:34,570
we'll be sternly finally realizing is

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,120
that this topic touches on everything

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,130
which is IT technology it basically if

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,770
you look at any area and information

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,750
technology swarms is touching it think

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,210
about intelligence think about

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,919
architectures think about security and

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,840
all the stuff adding privacy all of

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,000
those type of things play very much in

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,130
this warm room as well but I'll talk

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,630
about two particular type of

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,729
developments that I think are of

00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:01,900
interest to this audience right here

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,370
today first one is if I look at the

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,080
swarm as basically as all these elements

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,840
how do I if I want to build a platform

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,460
you have to have abstractions

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,000
abstractions are crucial to be able to

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,469
harness complexity in one thing we

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,849
realize is that if you look at all the

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:17,440
sensors basically and since there are

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,800
nothing else from a software perspective

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,349
than a log it's a log of data that I can

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,539
read you cannot change it and you only

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:28,360
can append you never can change the

00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:31,210
history of a particular log so if I can

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,009
take that abstraction sensors being a

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,190
network of locks that can basically

00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:38,139
exchange information then suddenly can

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,460
start thinking hiding away all the

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,500
intricacies

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,330
the wireless network the physical layer

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,490
what Mac layers you use and all this

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,699
type of thing ultimately the only thing

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,229
you do is read and write to locks and

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,520
you can have subscribe and your

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:53,229
interesting thing you can do is you make

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,169
this thing can make this thing secure

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:58,900
from the bottom up if I basically have

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,030
only one rider into a lock only that

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,729
sensor authentication becomes a lot

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,130
easier if you make sure that every link

00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:09,280
between locks is always encrypted no

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:12,580
data in the open ever we basically have

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,560
the basis for a secure platform so the

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,630
GDP is something we have been building

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,820
on for the last five years we have

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,979
operational prototypes and actually

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,470
they're getting deployed in a variety of

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,780
places we have routers and lock servers

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,940
all over the world California Germany

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,280
poor Rico the Philippines Japan and so

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,530
on so forth right now we have about

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,259
3,000 active locks it's not a trillion

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,870
yet that's where we want to go but 3,000

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:39,849
active locks basic operational and we

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,490
have a variety of interface mechanism

00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:45,039
because now if I have a lock and start

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,080
putting layers of software on top of

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,180
them that make it look like a file that

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,099
make it look like a stream you can do

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,840
all kinds of things with it and you can

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,240
have various interface languages deal

00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,750
with it so you open it up for the

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,520
software programming world now that's

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,340
great it basically provides me the

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,699
platform to think about swarms it's not

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,080
sufficient because what I need also that

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,570
one of the key challenges of the swamp

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,360
is indeed from its concept it is a

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,310
shared environment sensors can be used

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,979
by multiple application and should be

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,349
there shouldn't be uniquely applied or

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,000
identified for one application so it

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,130
means you can have resource conflicts

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,469
research conflicts on the sensors the

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:30,340
network's the computing devices and so

00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:32,620
on and so forth and still you want to

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,320
give some guarantees guarantees are

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,390
really important in application that

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,250
touch the real world guarantees in terms

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,169
of real-time delivery and so on and so

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,899
forth so you have to have resource

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,130
management resource management can only

00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,450
be done in one way I call it an

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,680
operating system it's been called an

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,140
operating system for a long period of

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,120
time so that's why I belong to term

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,230
swarm OS the operating system that

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,670
manages

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,410
you look at all the applications see

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,900
what they need and you figure out can I

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,090
have enough resources to do or support

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,800
this type of things and this is a

00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,200
project we have been working on for

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,940
quite a while together with the

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,920
University of San Paulo with Marcelo

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,370
who's gonna be actually talking later

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,790
today

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,700
he basically trying to say how can I do

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,500
now distributed guarantees how can I

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,300
provide distribute guarantees between

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,480
all those types of devices fighting for

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,010
them you we basically came up with the

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,300
term brokerages we didn't come up with

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,530
it this is a term that basically been

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,240
around for a long time but brokerage

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,600
basically says ok you have to you have

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,550
it's a demand and and resource type of a

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,320
negotiation factor and what you can do

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,420
is build on top of a platform you build

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,460
a set of services that help you to

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:43,120
support that brokerage functionality

00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:46,450
discovery registry optimization binding

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,770
policies basically monetization all

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,050
those kind of things can be built into

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,810
set of services that you build on top of

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,220
that network so the swamp voice has been

00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,710
making a lot of progress we have

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,690
prototypes operational and Marcelo will

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,790
talk a lot about this later in his

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:08,320
presentation this morning all right

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:10,740
so swarms are happening but there's

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,030
still a tremendous number of challenges

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,670
scalability is one indeed getting to

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,580
that trillion number robustness and

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,620
safety is crucial because again a lot of

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,540
this application touch real life and

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,420
could be life threatening the end so

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,280
robust is in safety guaranteed security

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,490
as you all know right now is one of the

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,560
biggest things in IOT has popped up or

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,440
since last year suddenly everybody says

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,610
well security is a key factor and we

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,240
still have to develop programming

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,600
paradigms and user paradigms but the

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,180
bottom line is the swarm is coming and

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,610
this from this better kind of a kind of

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,130
better movie from the 1970s it says it

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,020
size is immeasurable its power is

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,540
limitless and in the movie it was a

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,670
horror movie it says its enemy is man we

00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,800
try to make the swarm basically or

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,540
friend and that's the goal of basically

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,330
a lot of the test they're going on right

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,830
now but the key factor also is that

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,210
industry got really interested and a lot

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,370
this development along those fronts are

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,530
now happening in industry so from an

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,120
academic perspective we have to ask

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,670
themselves the question what's next

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,930
what's gonna happen now and that's what

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,980
I'm gonna basically spent the rest of my

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:24,920
presentation so I'm gonna go back to the

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,110
original swarm concept the idea of

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,450
swarms are basically as you see on this

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,790
movie flock of birds self forming

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,250
networks networks that basically don't

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:37,400
have particularly derp but basically do

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,740
certain tasks by basically combining

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
things basic interactions and so on and

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,740
so forth

00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,440
that's really what we're looking for at

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,300
the swarm and ultimately that was my

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,180
original dream and I was taken so this

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,130
is the type of system I'm thinking about

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,390
the swarms of today are basically senses

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,280
that are applied in a fixed position

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,470
they basically get commissioned they

00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,180
operate and thing like that nothing like

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:04,970
as dynamic as the thing I'm showing

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:07,580
right here so swung 2.0 is what I'm

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,410
looking at is extremely dynamic network

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,740
of huge numbers of connected entities

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,420
that try to perform certain tasks and I

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,120
called it a living Network because it's

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,240
changing all the time of everything

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,000
that's your IOT but also of everyone

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,500
humans are definitely and should be

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,430
involved in that whole network so

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,290
human-in-the-loop is going to be

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:38,840
absolutely essential can you click on

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:40,100
those lights please no previous one you

00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,560
can make this thing move it shows you

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,920
that actually this dynamic world that

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,500
I'm talking about is already happening

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,320
we start seeing basically the

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,730
possibility of having groups of robots

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,160
interacting with with each other groups

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,320
of drones doing tasks together you might

00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,790
have seen some of those I think it was

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,590
in the Superbowl earth of there that had

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,140
a basic bunch of drones doing things

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,530
together groups of robots traffic all

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:09,860
those type of things are examples of

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,180
very smart dynamic networks they're

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,550
moving around and I'll come back to that

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,410
upper video a little later the one on

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,590
the traffic which is correct I think is

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,750
a perfect example of what dynamic storms

00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,090
could basically do

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:26,060
so it's happening so what's what is this

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:29,060
doing well again here's the old swarm

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,810
picture where we have IT platform cloud

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:35,540
fork swarms but what I know see is that

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,820
by having those sensors everywhere in

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,100
dynamic configurations we can actually

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,760
start forming little bubbles little

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:48,020
bubbles of things that do interesting

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,360
tasks in a very dynamic way being humans

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,360
interacting with groups of drones trucks

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,090
driving together smart traffic groups of

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,720
robots doing things together and so on

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:01,880
support human robotic interaction all of

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,070
those are very dynamic systems they're

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,900
not fixed it's changing all the times it

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,710
interacts so you have to be able to deal

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:12,380
with change and dynamics so the swarm is

00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,570
evolving I think it's becoming more and

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,950
more autonomous the autonomy is gonna be

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,290
important it's not something that's run

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,730
centralized by no means but it's very

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:25,190
dynamic and as I said it's human centric

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:28,520
so let me give you some perspectives of

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,250
some different kind of projections of

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:35,990
this dynamic swarm it can go on very

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,730
different scales in space first area I'm

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,320
looking at is what I call and we'll come

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,620
back to that later the human internet

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,900
set of sensors around my human body that

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,690
help me to do things better or basically

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:51,890
understand how I operate a network on

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,380
its own but again extremely dynamic you

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,210
can look at something a larger scale the

00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,890
picture here shows you an interesting

00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:03,050
type of perspective suppose I have a

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,150
football stadium or soccer stadium

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,740
whatever it is and which people in the

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,600
audience and then want to see one

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,420
particular scene from a particular

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,150
corner what you can do is have a bunch

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:17,540
of drones flying around but a couple

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,920
hundred all of them with 3ac cameras you

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,170
take all those streams dynamically

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,060
together and I can reconstruct it in

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,610
such a way that it can provide every

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,770
single possible perspective and I can do

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,280
this for every single person in the

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,800
stadium you get your own personalized

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,559
augmented reality view

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,040
extremely dynamic extremely computed

00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:41,199
intensive and so on so forth

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,899
industrial internet same thing groups of

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,970
robots doing tasks and being doing these

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,910
things in a way that is sometimes

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,589
unforeseen and then you think about city

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,869
and nation networks basically large

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,059
networks that tried to banish things

00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,730
like movement mobility and so on and so

00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:00,459
forth if you look at it they all look

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,769
extremely different but in fact they are

00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,779
the same they have the same problems at

00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,730
every single scale sometimes the time

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,989
constants are a little bit different but

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,459
they basically have similar problems

00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:14,049
basically trying to address they also

00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:15,309
operate the multiple scales in time

00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,470
which is interesting which is this

00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:20,350
interplay between what should I do local

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,549
and what is gonna happen globally if I

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,249
look at the traffic problem I want to

00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:26,499
make a smart intersection right smart

00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:28,059
intersection where cars based can drive

00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:30,759
around and basically avoid each other

00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,989
without having have traffic lights now

00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,480
the information that comes in there

00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:36,549
basically comes on main many layers this

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,519
information that's stable for years like

00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:41,949
maps they don't change very often and

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,809
only when you put a new road in then you

00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:46,439
might have disruptions like you know

00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:49,990
construction going on that might be days

00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:51,610
you have traffic congestion which is on

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,199
the scale of minutes it forms on the

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,660
scale of minutes very rapidly still

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,089
something that I can handle quite nicely

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,399
globally but then you have the things

00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:02,799
that have to happen on a local base when

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,179
I approach an intersection I want to

00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,620
know who else is approaching where do

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,299
they come from what speed do they go and

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,699
so on support that's gonna help me make

00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,889
decisions and then you have that

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:15,689
squirrel jumping right in front of your

00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:18,220
car you have to react in milliseconds so

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:20,760
there has to be a set of control loops

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,850
here things that basically observe

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,829
transmit compute react and some of those

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,779
things have to happen very quickly has

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,789
to be done locally other things can be

00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:32,950
done very nicely in the cloud because

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:36,700
they can be shared and can be run under

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,260
much larger scale so again the example

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,000
here of your traffic management the

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,700
smart intersection which is a really

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,630
good example and I showed to examples on

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,730
one side you have the traditional

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,630
traffic management you put

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,370
synchronization

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,380
you put traffic lights people stopped

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,559
and so on so forth you let some people

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:56,289
to not very efficient it is efficient

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,840
and there's extreme saturation

00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:00,549
circumstances but in reality if I could

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,889
basically control all individual

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,740
elements slow them down speed them up I

00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:08,139
can actually make them do basically have

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,750
basically avoidance and actually be map

00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:12,820
have everybody pass through and limit

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,860
and basically unhindered now if you look

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,360
at the diagram of the software that's

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,190
need to do something like this is quite

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,649
interesting you have basically sensory

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,389
information of various sources on the

00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:25,389
cars in the infrastructure and so on and

00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:28,240
so forth you have historical data you

00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:30,100
know certain things you can't do state

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,559
estimation you're gonna predict and

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,350
ultimately gonna act either at the

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,490
global level or at a local level and all

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,340
of this has to be done in such a way

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,259
that it's entirely safe that nothing

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,210
ever goes wrong because otherwise would

00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:48,039
never be adopted so very interesting

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:50,320
problems from a control and disability

00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,639
he's not a very interesting example of a

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,659
swamp that you don't typically think

00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:57,460
about I call it the 5g plus plus but I

00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:00,460
think about how I will run a wireless

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,740
network well turns out our wireless

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,539
system today is basically our sensor

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,580
network everybody walks around with the

00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:09,129
sensor in their pocket it's an antenna

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,730
we have antennas everywhere antennas are

00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:15,399
sensors using that information I can

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,200
learn a lot about what's going on how

00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:19,029
the channels are what is changing what

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,350
is moving where you have blockages where

00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,870
you have interference and so on and so

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,240
forth if I now could use that

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,690
information to dynamically map traffic

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,840
onto resources you actually can have a

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,419
utilization which is stanley better than

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,820
what we do today it creates basically

00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,919
this micro organized networks that can

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,220
help us to basically increase capacity

00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,450
but also latency and so on and so forth

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,559
DARPA is getting into this they have a

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,080
project which is called the DARPA

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,289
spectrum challenge that really looks at

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,299
putting artificial intelligence into the

00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,879
running of wireless networks based on

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:56,799
what you observe what you learn about to

00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:59,049
other folks that trying to get resources

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,250
and adjust to this type of things so

00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:04,170
dynamic and

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:07,600
if intelligence are the key terms here

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:10,060
now getting back to my old picture

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,510
here's your old dynamic world one thing

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,710
you see primarily here it's all based on

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,140
machines moving and interacting with

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:20,080
each other however I don't think that's

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,190
sufficient actually humans are part of

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,900
the picture if you are smart in

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,880
intersection and as you see on this

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,190
video if a person crosses the road on

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,470
this bicycle you want to make sure that

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,080
person gets it safe or gets safe over

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,960
this as well so human in the loop is

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,850
very important it's a an important

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,760
component so the question you ask

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,580
yourself is how is we well we we as

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,990
humans survive in this smart dynamic

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,550
world and IO only one answer the only

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,710
answer is we should get smarter

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,780
ourselves as well all right that's the

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,060
only obvious thing we can come up with

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,460
and we have done that right we already

00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,840
walk around with mobile devices which

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,850
have changed the way we think with the

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,710
way we communicate and so on support so

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,700
we have basically start to change how we

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:09,220
as humans interact with Revolt already

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,110
but we have to go away beyond that so

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,610
you have to start thinking about

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,680
extending ourselves using the same

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,480
technology we're using to make that the

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,580
world's smarter to make this course all

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,220
smarter as well and that's what this

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,590
human Internet is all about envision

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,900
that you have an open platform around

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,300
your body or around the body in your

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:32,520
body and so on support that allows me to

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:35,080
add sensing devices on peuta vices

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,380
acting devices actuation devices all

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,300
around my body so sensing networking

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,890
computation activation again an open

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,110
platform it has to be open there's no

00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,560
question about that but the goal is

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,820
really to enhance human capabilities and

00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,880
if you have that you can do many many

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,370
different interesting things one of them

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,600
are called introspection something

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,700
that's already happening you bury a

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,310
device and you look inside your body you

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,900
see how while you operate and maybe do

00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,840
something about it when something's goes

00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,280
wrong so there's a number of devices now

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,080
getting on the market they are all

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,630
basically very focused on month target

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,220
one specific network ble or anything

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,389
like that you have to go away beyond

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,789
that has to again become

00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:18,339
bust private and so on support the other

00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:20,649
one is extra-special working with the

00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:23,169
world around you how do I convey what I

00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:26,709
want to see to the world around me

00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:29,349
using variety of either control devices

00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:31,479
getting information and enrich the input

00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:33,700
streams I'm getting insight into my body

00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:35,919
and so on so for information exchange

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,979
between human and robot and so on so

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,129
forth but ultimately it will lead to

00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:44,109
augmentation augmentation is adding

00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:47,049
capabilities that you hadn't before for

00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:49,749
instance could I have 360 degree vision

00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,389
wouldn't that be great or basically can

00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:54,159
I hear all the sound things like that it

00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:57,190
is something that's definitely possible

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,690
and one area that's primarily promising

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,849
is this whole domain of brain machine

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,219
their faces actually connecting my

00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,839
biological computer to the computers of

00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:06,579
the world to the physical computers out

00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,529
there something that's in the early

00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:10,119
phases but you've seen reactions of you

00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:11,349
people like Elon Musk and thing like

00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,999
that you see there's a lot of things

00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,969
happening and it's accelerating as we

00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:19,059
speak

00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:20,859
so bottom line this is a big agenda we

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,479
have the swamp agenda we're in place I

00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:24,009
said that's challenging but do you think

00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:27,249
about these dynamics it becomes even a

00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:29,349
lot harder because now we have to start

00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:31,119
thinking about tight latency latency is

00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:32,829
crucial in most of those control

00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,709
applications we talk about you want to

00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:38,229
act quickly in the human body you have

00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:40,329
20 milliseconds at most before action I

00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:43,299
have to happen after observation so

00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:45,879
tightly the closed loop systems yet the

00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:47,409
outcome has to be deterministic we don't

00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:48,879
we basically you won't have an intention

00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:51,579
you want to make sure you reach that

00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:55,329
goal in a presence of a very highly

00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:56,649
variable stochastic type of world it has

00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,239
to have cognitive capabilities no

00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:00,279
question about this this is really the

00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:02,829
big thing that we now start realizing

00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:06,070
over the last 10 years it has to be

00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:07,809
inherently robust and safe guaranteed we

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,369
gonna make sure it has to be safe

00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:12,190
otherwise you will never be accepted and

00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:13,839
has to be secure in private from the

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,700
ground up we have to start thinking

00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,739
about today what can I put in every

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,529
single little device that will make it

00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:24,399
secure in the longer run otherwise bad

00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:26,950
things will and can happen so big agenda

00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:29,070
bits many topics a components now

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,630
this is not purely about technology

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,520
actually this has a lot of other impacts

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,230
you think about managing let's say

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,910
Wireless Nettie think about managing

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,340
traffic you meant all the stuff eating

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:41,560
human helped all those type of factors

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,400
have also another very important

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,130
component as well

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,650
it's a socio-economic layer how does

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,770
this impact society how do we monetize

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:53,320
how do you basically create incentives

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:55,060
to basically people to participate all

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,290
those types of things are closely

00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,060
intertwined so it's not purely

00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,260
technology we can handle that but you

00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,630
have to think about the other circles as

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,560
well which are also important feedback

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:07,900
cycles now you really make it happen is

00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,280
non-trivial because I say I have a big

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,550
vision now that basically spends

00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,290
trillions of devices but it basically

00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,780
addresses so many different corners in

00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,170
terms of scales technologies application

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,430
focus the diversity of the players

00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,350
healthcare industry is very different

00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:25,420
than basically infrastructure in the

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,370
city very different dynamics in these

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,160
places funding sources and so on so

00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:32,020
forth so one of the key questions that

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,360
we're basically struggling with is how

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,830
to deal with this diversity while at the

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,750
same time creating some common ground

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,550
because in the end we're always trying

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,990
to solve the same problems just in

00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,520
different settings so that's the big

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,490
questions we're trying to basically

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,740
address today so the bottom line I think

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,750
this is very exciting it is really you

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,860
see the swarms are happening and I think

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,720
we're not we haven't seen anything yet

00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,090
the the next generation of the top

00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,410
position will be even more exciting but

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,570
at the same time it's good for us

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:04,240
academics there's a lot of interesting

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,590
problems to be solved thank you for your

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,680
attention

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,680
