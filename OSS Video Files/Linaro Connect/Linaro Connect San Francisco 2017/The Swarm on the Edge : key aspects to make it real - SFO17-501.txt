★ Session Summary ★
The Internet of Things (IoT) consists in the integration of networked computing entities into objects of our everyday life. Billions of devices are expected to be connected in the next years, revolutionizing modern society. An emerging approach that demands the support of dynamic and flexible management in the IoT is the Swarm. It envisions that a great number of independent, cross-niche and heterogeneous devices can autonomously cooperate with each other in order to execute tasks with synergy. It is aligned with the trend of social computing, where computing devices share their resources with each other, but in the Swarm, the idea is to have it happening autonomously, generating an almost organic computing network. In addition, it should not be limited to niches, working as a truly open system. In order to enable the Swarm, a software module, named Swarm Broker is integrated into each device that participate in the Swarm. This talk will present our approach for the Swarm Broker implementation and its status. The advances in the integration of constrained devices into the Swarm and the semantic engine architecture will be presented.
