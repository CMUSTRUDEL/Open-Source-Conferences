Track: LITE


★ Session Summary ★
The Internet of Things (IoT) consists in the integration of networked computing entities into objects of our everyday life. Billions of devices are expected to be connected in the next years, revolutionizing modern society. An emerging approach that demands the support of dynamic and flexible management in the IoT is the Swarm. It envisions that a great number of independent, cross-niche and heterogeneous devices can autonomously cooperate with each other in order to execute tasks with synergy. It is aligned with the trend of social computing, where computing devices share their resources with each other, but in the Swarm, the idea is to have it happening autonomously, generating an almost organic computing network. In addition, it should not be limited to niches, working as a truly open system. In order to enable the Swarm, a software module, named Swarm Broker is integrated into each device that participate in the Swarm. This talk will present our approach for the Swarm Broker implementation and its status. The advances in the integration of constrained devices into the Swarm and the semantic engine architecture will be presented.

	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,060
[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:26,380
so we're assuming on this device

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:32,920
professionally an adjustment optical

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:35,620
devices will begin so but basically we

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,890
are trying to create his level of

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,239
abstraction so we have two problems here

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:46,350
we have the technical problems but also

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:51,430
we have a very strong before in terms of

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:56,770
modeling these abstractions something

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,340
that is quite common in our group in any

00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:03,509
sense

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:08,590
we try to avoid centralizing entities

00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:11,140
building the swarm vision so in our case

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:16,000
we go a little bit deeper than

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:20,170
protesters vision because in our case we

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,429
eradicate any kind of centralized

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:30,039
intensity so usually we point out this

00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:31,600
picture when we say that Korean IOT is

00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:36,780
called

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:43,350
in our coats to make the broker viable

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,350
we mentioned they've allocated applause

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:51,320
without that that would be not feasible

00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:54,289
in real life but it's a principle to

00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,390
consecrate the minds of poverty the

00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:59,840
workers on this obstruction

00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:04,549
so in our outward implementation

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,939
holidays with fully positive not

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:13,959
considering the cloud or any centralized

00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:13,959
it for entities into the process so

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:25,400
others replication data some engineering

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:30,170
requisites no this one need to be

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:34,120
adaptive little bit erogenous that's why

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,620
the 96 work program fits very well

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:43,420
because on the nine seats all were

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:47,390
talking from high-end social next 24 are

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,780
very simple and so when you talk about

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:54,350
this warm we were to have these

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,799
implementations working in all these

00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:00,110
devices forever it is operating system

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:03,390
wherever is

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:09,110
for advocacy networking and everything

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:11,190
else so little be adaptive heterogeneous

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,480
self-organizing we always put this

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:20,720
picture here about ants building a

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:24,390
bridge so to perform some tasks somehow

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,530
build a bridge but how they do the

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:32,310
bridge because in the insect world they

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:36,660
doesn't have we set boss it doesn't have

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:41,270
a manager so they self organized itself

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:45,660
before irritant to build a bridge so

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:48,030
finally looking for nature we are trying

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,520
to design a virus pirate operating

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,090
system where we try to understand from

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:58,820
where this kind of intelligence

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:06,209
intelligence of certain insects arose

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:11,280
because civil authorities everything we

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:17,880
built is human centric so while this

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:20,840
imagine a boss a general manager but in

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,430
this one we need to avoid these concepts

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,900
so the question is how are chemically

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:32,210
these devices can organize themselves

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,380
we'll have some examples for example

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,560
watching

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,850
blockchains that hand of self-organizing

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,250
thankfully there is not a manager

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,380
controlling the country so then that

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:53,550
kind of obstruction that were looking

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:57,870
for we spent almost what an a half year

00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:02,860
organizing the is church er oz we call

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:05,620
this swarm length so this one leg is not

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,710
the Rideau operating system at this

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:13,780
moment it's a meter

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:17,530
it's a meet word the total account also

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:21,700
the broker the embedded on a computing

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:27,760
device like a 96 board it will became a

00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:29,410
swarm insect so that's it man and the

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,680
broker is basically a communication

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:36,160
mediator for interrogating devices to

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:42,460
create is attacked here by this party or

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:45,310
gaming networks so let us recall the

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,280
platform services for the broker so we

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:52,020
need to have discovery registry access

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:55,090
control binding policy management

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,540
contracting services optimization

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,370
services accounting and mediation at

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,120
this moment in our group we are only

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,120
five people

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:15,680
so I will tell you our recent advances

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:20,930
we we choose a very interesting language

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:26,639
to program the program it is the Alexia

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:34,080
galaxy itself in English and has better

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:37,500
performance than Java it's more

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:43,009
expressive also usually we need much

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:49,460
less coding lines to write software that

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:52,650
experiment when there is you know a 15

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:58,770
so it covers our thought processes that

00:06:52,650 --> 00:07:02,870
we're looking for so we're implementing

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,669
them detector to do semantic discovery

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,310
so yes

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:11,550
the devices they need to know what

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:22,590
you'll be about themselves for example

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:26,190
what we know is from nature and nose so

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:30,719
that is the idea behind this amazing

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:32,669
discovery we are also implementing what

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:38,509
we call an attribute based access

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:41,069
control so we need to mediate insecurity

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:46,110
we need to guarantee privacy and

00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:51,719
ownership and also we need to have a

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:57,060
secure swarm so then we need to prevent

00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:59,509
hackers we are using this moment the

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,980
National Institute of civilization

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:07,240
quality metrics so guarantees

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:11,730
security under labor sometimes we are

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:15,040
talking about fairly limited processors

00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:17,020
so seems like work chaining or

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,540
honey-dipped ography doesn't work in

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,000
this case and we need to have a

00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,180
architecture that works in our

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,350
instruction sets from the lowest end to

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:34,830
the onion signals something interesting

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:39,970
that we have implemented recently it's a

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:44,440
proxy transparent if T to be co-op proxy

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:46,780
vironment what is the idea behind we

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,590
need to have the web accessing these

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:55,180
cells and usually in high end systems we

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:58,060
use HTTP for the codec sauce and in low

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,540
end we use co-op and we need to keep

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,440
these devices talk each other so we have

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,600
implemented our very interesting

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:13,270
distributed no centralized environment

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,820
where we do this proxy skin so a number

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:19,120
of insects come talk with another

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:25,170
insects in different protocols HTTP of

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,170
quad on a proxy both

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:36,260
also we are starting to do a film work

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:42,890
to simulate discovery cnames we believe

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:46,970
that as soon as we start to destroy this

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:49,430
format or brokers this firm OS we will

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,970
find out applications where we will

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:58,250
deploy thousands of the scents and we

00:09:52,970 --> 00:10:05,899
start to simulate how these networks you

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:08,500
organize itself and finally with

00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:11,390
computing artists in simulation platform

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:16,459
so we want to do simulation before the

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:20,209
point yet so the test platform need to

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:22,100
consider a large amount of requests we

00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:28,370
want to have these simulations working

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:34,100
physical the simulation is no container

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:38,899
simulated so that is what we are working

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:42,350
on at this moment we are integrating out

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:47,270
these are structures in this format or

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:50,740
in the program and that are the two two

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:53,839
dimensions that we are looking for so we

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:58,520
have some people looking for gel

00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:00,140
vocalizing discover devices we are

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,110
looking also for self-organizing

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:09,820
networks something that is really

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:13,029
important is what we call the micro

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,730
economy model of this one

00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:21,019
we can observe that on the Cardinal with

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:24,980
sharing services we sharing memory with

00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:29,749
sharing of resources for us it's very

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,970
clear how to do that on the deep work so

00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:36,319
excluded to us all to curate an economy

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:39,499
a monetization process on the cloud but

00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:44,149
what about making these micro colony on

00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:47,809
the edge or on this one we need to think

00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:51,980
about so we have some people try to

00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:55,519
understand how swarms sharing resources

00:11:51,980 --> 00:12:00,679
they will be able to create the economy

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:05,720
or entire economy honeybees and also

00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:08,959
automatic access and control voice so

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:15,009
that is what I have to present now and I

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,009
hope maybe the next connect

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,600
[Applause]

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,970
so he said it's decentralized and

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,190
there's no central manager but one thing

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,310
that's happening a lot with all the

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,890
sensors is their their volume of data is

00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:48,570
not this too high production courses

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:52,480
hopefully so with machine learning in

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:57,400
audio and video sensors you need another

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,420
entity that has enough for you to

00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,900
actually process

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:05,050
how are you see that fitting into the

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:09,400
decentralized model that this is an

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:13,630
excellent question for example once a

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:18,370
discussion I spent almost one in my mind

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:22,720
to resolve that this forms are two

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:27,250
versions that means that you have very

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,820
low end devices media and devices you

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:35,200
see is social next there is super

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,570
powerful 24 core ARM processor we're

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:45,700
also working with NVIDIA and the video

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:49,480
just released SOC with 256 GPUs but a

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:53,520
very small a smaller sized board like

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:57,970
the Knights export they really want era

00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:01,089
so what we do believe in these modern

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,260
fully decentralized environment we will

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:05,500
have these steps with higher cross

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,740
capacity

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:13,270
and exactly very long process and

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:17,740
somehow this form will need to fit these

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:27,280
mothers before civilizing so that's the

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:31,270
vision but Haas professor young poses in

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:34,360
his lecture when we talk about forms as

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:38,790
a vision for every question that we do

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:44,290
there are many others associated to your

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:46,090
question is still let's say open but

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,940
they do not say that is what we open

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:53,200
because if you believe that very soon

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:56,220
we'll have 96 boards reaching tariffs of

00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,140
the forms on a very small form factor

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:04,780
let's say that you have 1,000 insects

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,680
delivering one can afford to have one

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,770
careful

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,670
so there could either performs enough to

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,670
perform this hand

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:18,400
is fantasy and we see that he major we

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:21,820
see that as you must know collectively

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:25,300
working together so the question is how

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:28,660
to find out our structural models to

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:32,980
support decision on unknown

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:35,370
synchronising approach it's a very

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,380
tricky question

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,230
yeah the good questions are to want to

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,300
open more questions that they answer

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:46,270
yeah I think that the whole point there

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:49,360
is the transactional model right because

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:53,950
we will have randomly located more

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,930
powerful snows there due to local

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,570
processing but they're not going to

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,540
communicate with other local in other

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,250
areas so it's like Bitcoin right you can

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,020
do local transactions but because they

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,660
have some kind of synchronization you

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,030
then can have global states even though

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,240
things happening locally so if you have

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,180
a different model a database process

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,830
pipeline through local nodes and only

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,720
the result of that processing is going

00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,240
to be pipeline at higher levels for

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,480
higher nodes and so on you can do a lot

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,490
of computer at the edge without spending

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,020
like because why I said well you need a

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,930
lot of memory bandwidth you need a lot

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,600
of CPU power what you do if you have to

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,950
do all the vector in process and then

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,930
move on to the account which is the

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,840
current model which less work doesn't

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,180
say but if you have the processing

00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,090
happily engaged

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,030
it's a non-local you think of Numa why

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,980
do you have different memory

00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:53,110
accident and the burger has to

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,820
understand that that beats the mango you

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,520
will have additional costs of moving

00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,980
back and forth so if you then have a

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,520
memory model that doesn't needs to be

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,140
all in one place it's like big data you

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,630
have different service and don't do a

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,510
global sort you do multiple local source

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:14,260
and then just fudge that to make it work

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:18,300
at a higher level so if you just need to

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,300
change how you think about state

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,410
muscle memory and it is

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,410
should've been reading shoot across

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:50,230
church certain areas became central I

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:50,230
get to sterilize that for what this is

00:17:52,090 --> 00:18:00,520
so this example of the HTTP kohat proxy

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,070
for resource constrained devices could

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:07,380
be a way to implement his vision of

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:11,470
offering distributed processing on an

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:14,110
organic network so in this case we have

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,810
a device here that only talks HTTP and

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,040
this one only talked squad under the

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:24,310
proxy environment offers a service and

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,830
when they immediately started to that we

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:30,660
start to imagine an economy because they

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:35,140
they are sharing resources in the echo

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:38,350
at this moment our business models works

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:41,260
very well with his wealth to to the

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:43,270
health it makes sense was no big

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,970
corporation every making money with that

00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,520
reward probably and Citrix so the

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,030
question is how in this process of

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,160
sharing resources in the edge on

00:18:51,030 --> 00:19:00,460
imbalances on materials in this way or

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:03,880
funny again to deal with the massive

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:06,300
amount of census data that is interested

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,300
everywhere

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:13,120
the proxy could be away but another

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:19,960
thing that is important mantich working

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:22,419
this level latencies really so he

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,510
suspect us because it doesn't need to

00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:31,000
communicate anymore with a huge cloud

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:34,120
Sentinel for example the mayor of são

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,309
Paulo my city Texas very crowded worse

00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:43,960
than in terms of traffic a prophetess he

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:48,220
saw an old inaugural science letters in

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:52,350
support of engages in an idea could be

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:56,019
possible using a swarm water on

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:58,750
semaphores on the streets ago cote the

00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:59,980
singapore's on a heavy traffic

00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,220
environment

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:06,929
behave like a swarm self organize these

00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,929
cells water get attractive

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:16,090
and city clerk just about there being

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,419
multiple swarms so what are your

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:22,059
thoughts in terms of how a device Heaphy

00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:24,160
joins security becomes part of a swarm

00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:26,110
that's uncommitted okay in orderly sex

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:35,260
they smell like their pheromones that

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:37,690
you know we can tell they aren't it yes

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:41,490
about that because we need to have a

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:46,720
safe swarm but device it doesn't have

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:49,840
the capacity to process these two

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,370
systems at this level but there are some

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,490
constraints or some control situations

00:20:53,370 --> 00:21:00,910
because yes he says they talk to each

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:03,240
other but for a very short period so if

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,210
you consider the tightening of your

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:12,850
secure message so the missile has a

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:16,600
mighty cycle so one of our engineers

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:22,570
they had created a variational squad may

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:25,260
be quite included quad we are using very

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,600
simple cryptography

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,299
16 bits but we need to guarantee the

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,690
strict ography for a certain amount of

00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:39,549
time so we guarantee that information

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:42,929
safe for some medicines you know so

00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:46,450
that's another idea to have considering

00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:49,550
because that is the deadly concept

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,950
yes these engineer detector right letís

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,230
is so very soon you'll have the papers

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,730
around that okay they were interesting

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,620
yeah I mean there's people that are

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,270
working on objects theory for car

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:04,220
OS car and but it's typically everything

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,100
needs to be scared forever the other

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:11,540
people start and so the department yeah

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:17,420
yeah if we cannot guarantee that the

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:19,040
device could be fully security at least

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:24,160
a message that he said it could be

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,160
secure for a given amount of time not

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,190
the key exchange if you were talking

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,400
about me two seconds to exchange will

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:42,350
probably dominate the time of the whole

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,180
right so you have to exchange and then

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,720
see okay populates it now just once a

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:50,150
copy

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:53,030
go on so that becomes a big part yeah

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,010
but there is another bodies are in here

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,290
that we're having some things have come

00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:01,750
to us about that

00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:08,120
you see when unfarmed is a target box

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:10,520
this one eros sometimes doesn't matter

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,940
that we teach it but you can serve the

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:17,020
whole environment so what we imagine on

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,740
eventually a cyber attack on a swarm

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:23,140
maybe we will lose some sex

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:27,490
we'll be contaminated but they do

00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:30,429
preserve the whole castle

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,090
that's ideas behind but in this moment

00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:37,330
when we talk about regions of devices

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,659
there will be some chip that doesn't

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,570
matter

00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:43,870
I can't reboot them yeah right that's

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:46,289
the idea I mean after a cyber attack you

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,120
can people study days

00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:51,370
yeah because computers doesn't die even

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,520
transfer your Jersey saw this article

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:57,340
the question is you can lose some

00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:01,929
insects in the fight but in the end it

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:04,570
can be engineering for example one thing

00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:07,809
is spark interest to see how they can

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:15,070
use this technology to avoid heart

00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:17,590
attack on home part process we've had so

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,870
many conversations I think so much for

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,789
all the connectivity ended in you've

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,500
been here I might have heard this wrong

00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:28,750
he said in the beginning you have five

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:31,149
people dedicated to this how can whether

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,640
it be nice porcelain ara help you

00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:34,450
further what do you need to expand the

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,730
program

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:43,570
I see it's helping a lot by India we

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:45,600
want to apply you know are they talking

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,600
about

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:53,400
if it was the first statement of no need

00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,730
to be open we are trying to open it no

00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,210
it's because the soft is not still very

00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:04,950
documented but I think on a different

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:07,320
point we evolved in this one ways to me

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,480
neural oscillation it you can all

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,820
support that we have already we were

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,260
hysterically making these on my keys

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,950
bubbleman's

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:23,430
some drugs that we have students for

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:27,170
example day in our beauty they want to

00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:32,070
have a strong approach to manage likely

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:35,010
because you can save energy so the idea

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:38,880
is this funky cognizes bat-mite into the

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:42,180
moon my life's few lighting another guy

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,610
it was more like so they're doing these

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:51,420
permutations to compromise from solar

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:55,350
solar panels using what my dream is on a

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:56,660
given point opening it and see how

00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:00,280
interesting

00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,280
what's nice applications

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,880
[Applause]
