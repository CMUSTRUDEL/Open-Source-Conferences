	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,060
[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,740
so welcome to the LMG lightning talks

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,779
where we are going to talk about what

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,200
energy has been doing over the last

00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:29,890
couple of months and couple of things to

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,860
know in the future we'll start with um

00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:38,590
it's talking about Android collaborative

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:41,890
franchisees hi my name is Amit ing

00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,330
conducting and we're talking about the

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,989
never enjoyed conduct top acknowledges

00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,989
which human tail

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,660
just press space or anything

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:10,300
don't you alright space so I'll start

00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:12,850
with diversity cratchits which we

00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,460
maintain let's get the version 3.18 and

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,700
wait until what for

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,860
so we don't actively maintained 2.18

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,759
anymore mostly because they don't get

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,920
any requests to keep it up to date so

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,690
I'm just hoping that and I think that

00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:35,110
since no one is using just stop

00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,680
objecting it but we still much IDs

00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,220
please

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:45,820
so this is the topic parent which I said

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:47,680
which I said to see so he he then mulch

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,259
this topic branching to the next dinero

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,500
is the emergency protecting version food

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,940
a food and ranchers so theta 15 as I

00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,979
said we have not been getting it so I

00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,679
especially when children we have I mean

00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:02,920
by P I mean energy not and right off not

00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:05,860
LTS so don't get confused there let's

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,490
get food our food we do updated time to

00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,620
time then have enjoyed a little 63 is

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:16,569
the tree which if you are not familiar

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,550
with be rebase and right 4.9 patches to

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,520
mainline treats time to time I think we

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,680
do it on every RC basis we do miss

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,050
member to our C's but it is fairly

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:35,800
regular so the time status is that we

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:38,170
have rebased 4.9 patches to 4.14 RC - I

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,860
think somewhere around for that 11 or so

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,510
I have dropped the edge I said

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,180
there was not a lot of refactoring

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,370
happened at that time in the scheduler

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,570
code this and was difficult for me to

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:57,230
understand what is going on so I just

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:59,960
stopped the VDS back set right so this

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,620
is the so this is the you'll see this

00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,620
take us so far

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,320
I mean 4.9 patches on top of food our

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,540
protein our c2 the biggest chunk of code

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,840
is it used to be networking some time

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,730
back but now it is a stigma at this

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:19,390
there was a talk and we see in the last

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,390
two last week about mystical FSS women

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,530
so stick a likeness of swimming so if

00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,290
you are interested in the stream status

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:30,950
of SD card offense if it is going there

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:35,209
what is happening in that scene then you

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:38,570
can check out this presentation then the

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,810
next chunk of code is next big check of

00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,940
Polish networking with 15% in a net

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:49,160
filter itself which was cute a guy be an

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:53,720
idle time people purchase with sure out

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:56,180
there the cubic idea is supposed to be

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,040
going away sometime soon because they

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,569
are going to have the same functionality

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,090
using the upstream maybe

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,849
implementation I can't have posted the

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,670
link of PC talk which happened around

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:11,609
this topic during the plumber's so if

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,900
you're interested you can check it out

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:23,160
PPP by just Sam from Davao the I assign

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:25,860
has worked on so he has implemented a

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,750
functionality using upstream code base

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,270
which is all of the mini linemen you

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,750
know all the pictures are already pushed

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,370
to Android carrot which arendelle review

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,460
so hopefully you might be able to top

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,800
the TPP patches as well and then we have

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,080
paramagnetic locking which I think will

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,880
sustain it for a while it's not a big

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,139
chunk of so next is USB USB ketchup

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,680
ensures MTBE PPP for your source

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:57,960
accessories I went into one activity

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,940
system project which means that you know

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,580
if we are moving to function FS so just

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,810
this is a particular batch that says

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,310
that now that that is happening sometime

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,860
soon

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,620
so once we move to function FS then we

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,500
should be able to drop empty impdp from

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,530
us because it's but we are still getting

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,150
a product protein now I will try to see

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,789
here the functionality is already there

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,300
in university master branch if it is

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:32,190
there then let's see maybe maybe

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,930
we can get it operated for 13:10 staging

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,830
the FI to debug are a few changes in

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,940
world Fisher militarist these are

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,380
standard changes I mean these are the

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,389
standard patches which are there in I

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:48,020
don't think when your new change is

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,020
selected at the same there it is input

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,880
using these because these fibers then

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,370
there is a bunch of Gordon asked

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,870
directly mostly effectively TB support

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:19,560
image dz/dt be trying to that conference

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,970
come online extension we might be able

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,250
to get rid of come along extinction

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:27,539
support because there is a similar

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:31,250
functionality upstream so this is

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,250
something which we have not explored yet

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,900
then there is some coding device makers

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,580
there are travelers the specific to a

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,980
updates and write will be updates and

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,370
that's per to ID system statistics which

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,770
would you export the statistics to block

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,780
interface

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,970
another mission is changes SDI no make

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:00,050
up reasons and small small changes and

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:04,170
ellipses of system and traces of system

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:07,050
so this was the illicit Easter and then

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,960
see these stats just after a comparison

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:13,350
of what was there in 4.9 and what is not

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:17,070
there now in 4.14 low memory can also

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:21,840
drop main 93 I think product whether

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,320
4.13 lip-sync same framework it be

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,350
rebirthed

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,910
most of it has moved to I guess in their

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:32,340
face and active learner we have dropped

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:36,240
because most of most of the vendors are

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,270
now using reverse did you know so we are

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,250
not carry forward easy to put up footing

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,350
do the idle notifiers also I talked to

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,180
develop effect to be still be that they

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,550
said we are Peter Rabbit so that is also

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,660
body there are few different platform

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,300
headers which may have also dropped

00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,050
because they are not being used since

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,700
3.10 because I could see the references

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,430
in Theta 10.com drivers

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,230
that they are not used anymore and there

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:05,940
are swell few patches which were there

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:11,580
and no hacks which were commit to the 9

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:13,140
or 10 years ago I talked about that do

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,570
you think we still make this patches of

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,000
it would still be in hack so most of the

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:20,130
time there are like the I try to contact

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,840
the author and that email promised back

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:26,850
because it so I tried I tried asking

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,010
other people they said to say to those

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,110
patches as well and that complete

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,690
fragments got dropped few days back

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:37,580
so we have dropped it from food or

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:40,229
protein as well but these are the stats

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,390
perfectly basis the number of lines

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,540
which we are carrying in 2.18 food are

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,700
for and hopefully and what is a status a

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,220
manual City now this green Delta is the

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,710
r-spec set which I dropped from photo

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,440
tonight which I'm not getting in for not

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:59,220
coding which a approximately I think it

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,270
is TLS version 1.1 so most of most of

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,020
the functionality has on the green

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:07,670
upstream so it might be a bit less than

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,670
what is shown here

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,050
okay so I thought then Ellen City we

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:38,430
have Android kernel trees I spent some

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:40,470
time there was a feature to escape I'll

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,570
give you those patches to Android Heike

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:49,560
thank you to a suitable platform to test

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:51,000
that so on Heike so the issues which I

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,820
there are few issues which I found which

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,010
I run into on both Heike and hanky 916 I

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,990
was using hike even GV board and and

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:02,300
guide itself was taking about 750 MB or

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,300
so so I was able to create the image and

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,929
[Music]

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,880
as well we done into CPU lock ups while

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,660
trying to enable the mod o'clock so it

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,660
was sort of a dead end

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,290
since I had like an ASIC see so I try to

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,410
rank 960 at that time it the support was

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,780
much better because I was able I did not

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,850
run into any CPU lock curbs or any other

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,060
issues the only problem was that my

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,920
display did not come on Mikey it was you

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,890
know sorry my clock was enabled but the

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,740
display didn't come up I tried to be

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,270
working around the DRAM driver but

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,970
my knowledge in that area is very little

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:55,130
so so so what I did I came up with this

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,010
idea of using virtual trade buffer like

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:01,340
that the system is already in suspend so

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:04,880
instead of relying on actual actual

00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:07,670
frame buffer let's try this system is

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,800
new home on virtual play poker and do a

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:13,670
recording using screen record in Mattoon

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:17,960
right so when the system booted up I did

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:21,560
I did the screen recording and I went in

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,260
to suspend to this then I power it on

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,780
resume from the disk and then I created

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,360
another video and I was winning multi

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,360
test right monkey testers like to you

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,130
sending certain random events to me why

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,150
so I could say that the display was

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:42,140
behaving the way it should be

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,790
so I didn't see any reason why I don't

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,580
see any reason why this message is not

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,140
complete which is that we aren't able to

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,460
test it to an actual device which has

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,460
effective display

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,819
so that's all from my cell because any

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,819
cushions

00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,270
use whatever

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:17,360
this is - exactly

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,070
I was a division member the latest fad

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,580
secondly which is that by the time I hit

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:25,880
4.11 RC there was a bit of restructuring

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,470
in the scheduler code and I adjusted

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,180
rebasing I didn't know at the top that

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,710
code what just happened there so it was

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:59,780
very difficult for me to know it

00:12:30,710 --> 00:13:02,320
correctly so I just work recolor

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,980
basically got relief from staging and

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,710
there's been an effort to ask to get a

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,060
solution

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,830
I guess a lot of understand with a

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,210
solution or the sufficient because it

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,520
wouldn't react quite as fast

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,440
so there's apparently further work

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,089
internally

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,089
for a solution

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:27,250
right now get away without it for

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,930
testing

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,380
depending on

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,460
and pulled back intercept your device

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,110
but you've got a little bit of time

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,110
before a 14 that's good

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:56,210
hi my name is mr. Kim from because I

00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:59,150
will explain a bit about my work sisters

00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:05,150
Connect which is about ESP built without

00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:07,700
Street claim so actually using of three

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,460
claim of building there is a USB master

00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,730
this be my primary work since I joined

00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:19,040
to dinero which is last steel and field

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:22,010
and those two playing trunk and ESP

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,580
Massa are two moving targets so we have

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:28,820
to continuously watching those two or

00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,160
computability this work is meaningful in

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,640
the sense that the privity claiming they

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,500
ESP normally live behind in time three

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,130
to six months is compared to that of

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,130
stream claim so completely with five

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:46,280
month gap between the two so this work

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:50,480
allows us to check plank performance on

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:54,200
ESP especially for a RPC 200 built and

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:59,870
it also helps claim to soft land on a

00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:02,660
Davis payment time comes so last time I

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,610
checked is based on the burden of the

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:10,010
tea master in the option-click trunk at

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,900
13th of September there is no visible

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,440
performance increase compared to the

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,140
previous claim which is kind of good is

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,940
there is no performance

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:24,399
either so so in addition to this

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,100
continuous maintenance work I have

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:31,000
applied some more stuff to those who

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:35,589
claim for building a SP which is an MP

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,050
support and pulley so totally empty is a

00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:43,209
maple Minka which is a drop-in

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:47,079
replacement for canoe linka such as ld50

00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:50,790
and quote so the current default link up

00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:55,240
for a axis opened in a SPD's quote

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:58,269
Soviet immense the quote with LED and we

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,820
found some issues such as three mission

00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:04,839
options and some company compatibility

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:07,209
issues so we these readers are reported

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,339
to the trooper to take working group and

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:13,149
I believe some of these issues are

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:18,040
currently being added to it to be for

00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:22,120
led to be more compatible with LSP so

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:25,300
and secondly support which is people

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,029
optimizer on elevate ayah that this

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,390
technique is basically tries to find

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:36,850
missed opportunities for solidification

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:39,579
on the final edible aya so and we

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:43,149
applied it unfortunately there is also

00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:45,760
some bugs found so we reported these

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:48,790
books to the beta phase also of this

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,820
technique and as a workaround

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,940
we only apply this technique to Bionic

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,110
and benchmark but unfortunately there is

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:02,090
no beautiful performance

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:06,400
and lastly Bali which is new and it's a

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:09,770
locality of Tamiya we enabled all these

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,160
optimizations that dairy supports many

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:17,360
skull optimization and automatic openmp

00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:19,400
generation and also vectorizer and as

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,210
you can see on the graph on the screen

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:28,030
there is no performance increase this is

00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:32,030
attitude so these videos are post

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:34,550
fortunate and unfortunate it is it is

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,520
fortunate in the sense that the stream

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:40,270
plan is doing ok without any visible

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:43,790
performance regression but if it is also

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,230
unfortunate for me because my my work

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,290
for the last two tournaments is

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:51,290
regarding poly and super has not been

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:55,700
paid off so we also we're above the

00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:58,220
items that we want to apply so I'd like

00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,910
to ask you that if you have any you know

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,850
interesting and promising items to apply

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,670
to those we plan for building ASB Massa

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,220
please protect me with the with the item

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,380
and the benchmark they can measure the

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:18,610
specific changes caused by the by the

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:23,529
new stop that'd be great yeah it's sweet

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,529
eventually because their bench one slide

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,340
right

00:18:38,630 --> 00:19:10,710
yes I mean this is everything is that

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,929
about performance

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,390
so I being able to have pension

00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:18,799
performance benchmarks but we compare

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,659
the size of the resulting wineries but

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:26,730
as I said there are some computability

00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:29,640
choose what is what is about relocation

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,909
pepper and tonic which reduces the size

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,549
of the resort - if this is what would be

00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:38,850
with the relocation Pecha so the reach

00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:41,510
of the Padres our energy is a bit larger

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,510
than the old

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,180
okay thank you

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:13,710
many armies

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:27,190
Asya what the released money before now

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:30,730
we released the healthy appeals based on

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:40,120
the requirement from various products of

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:44,620
him the released as the a beautiful will

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:48,160
be to be the latest stable advertise and

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:51,850
the winds the Kuna from our based on are

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:57,450
asking are from based on the know from

00:20:51,850 --> 00:21:01,660
AOSP on the research we will these

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:05,559
features new changes and the of the

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:09,900
found of Medicine changes regarding the

00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:13,260
performance changes we include the

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:16,750
optimization changes for memory and

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:23,890
pounding or many some next

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:28,890
also we will update the LCS with the new

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:33,070
version as the afternoon production

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:39,490
about security touch we have a few

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:43,900
minutes and the apogee enables happy we

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:49,809
also use a newer protein versions for

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:54,809
sample that we build with the GCC c6 I

00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,809
use me is the master

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:08,710
detective we made some tests with lava

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:17,650
cream to interest apologies of all our

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:20,410
camp you know just basically phone to

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:26,220
type of basic functions benchmark a

00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,220
state boy in fraternities no regression

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:45,040
for compatibility relationship we also

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:49,780
have the emergency a beautiful to try to

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,820
change for different if that's the

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,550
change to work work on different

00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:01,500
platforms sometimes the change might be

00:22:54,550 --> 00:23:01,500
met work only on specific platform

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:15,990
the custard the testicle we would say

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:19,740
also that means drama so thankfully make

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:25,470
sure the texture is really useful and

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:29,400
the result is stable now we are working

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:34,640
under Torrio pays the bills with the

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,640
lobby to support more features

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,820
he replaced the Sun a petitioner

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:53,370
increment in the future we met William

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:59,890
turkic mall which changes from a tree in

00:23:53,370 --> 00:24:08,340
our base their bills also considering to

00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:08,340
you one comment about best possible

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,500
calorie keep used very often another

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:31,099
we also we are considering food and some

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:41,349
to create some platforms to to tempt me

00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:45,289
with making small if you have any

00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:48,009
product one - what has to increase in to

00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:48,009
the article

00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,710
that's all

00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,820
what it of these

00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:01,749
Abdi

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:13,550
but you mentioned of Katies individual

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:13,550
in India what in opting he's checked out

00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:35,910
and God II has or are you testing

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:41,880
haughty functional this second question

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:44,690
on the boot time is time with Android Oh

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,690
measure

00:25:52,550 --> 00:26:05,160
ultimately not integrated yet we are

00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:07,500
live in freedom on verified the mission

00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:14,600
patches we have the coordinates

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:21,390
I mean Android and optimizations it was

00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:26,810
20% implement C is a number similar we

00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,810
expect no improvements

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,860
in

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,289
we not sir Mohammed

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:12,620
in next up is our work on you have 64

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:14,480
militarists so why would you want to do

00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,850
that to trust a father because we can

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,750
promptly outrun it since it's because

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:22,490
these days

00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:26,350
96 called 60 folks should companion as

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:29,020
much faster didn't intend for x86 or so

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,280
it's also a test environment for

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,550
four-minute boxes which probably don't

00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,020
have too much testing and a first step

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:40,270
towards a totally native built

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:42,710
environment so Nikolas said you can just

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,560
do what you do under any right answers

00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:47,780
that make a couple of modifications

00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:52,640
right on your device without having to

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:55,400
reflash the firmware image even the ATP

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,000
installer something wrong what about to

00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:01,460
test your change so the current status

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,550
compilers both claim Jesus eBay store

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,820
chains already built will start at live

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:11,510
in a previous directory like Solyndra

00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:14,570
ACP so are not built and ready built

00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:17,990
with x86 out codes there's a lot of

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:23,390
tourism has been ported to detect a CPU

00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:27,500
tab called right batteries all related

00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:29,630
for this project - 800 r12 and we have a

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,100
patch set to this quite easy to rebase

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:36,350
on master changes but there's one thing

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,690
missing the bills aren't working yet to

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,610
count problem instant a ninja files

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,450
generated by zoom differ from the

00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:45,170
counterparts

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:49,520
created on x86 boxes and we don't really

00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:53,440
know what's going on there yet so and we

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,940
should have updates by the next connect

00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,020
most of the differences between those

00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,640
manager files don't look that big to

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,850
some of the error messages we are

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,970
getting those can be worked around by

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,010
just making Schwab already

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,240
the ends are built at runtime even

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:14,799
though they are already there in the

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:17,260
previous tree but then just results in

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,750
more errors about duplicated definitions

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,600
so we really have to dig more into the

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,840
build system just probably not much more

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,690
missing or the pre-built cydia and tests

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,679
for all those binaries are working as

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:35,970
the truth but it's just this generation

00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:40,240
of the ninja files so that seems to have

00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:43,390
one or two things were missing but it's

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,809
one of those things that can as enabled

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:53,490
by a lot of time 205 10 minutes so any

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:53,490
questions on absence Tomatoes

00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:04,230
of course as soon as it's working that

00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:07,110
will try to achieve everything I mean

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,330
then obviously whether or not will be

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:14,280
accepted as not up to us

00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:17,070
but so far pretty much that has been yes

00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,460
if it works but don't bother us until

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,460
it's done

00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:31,860
next topic is cstp integration which as

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,670
most is at issue unfortunately isn't our

00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,890
anymore so what is it it's a new

00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:40,260
compression it's a system that can give

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:43,110
speeds comparable to as before which is

00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,720
a very fast but not very efficient

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:51,210
compressor and it can also provide file

00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:54,690
size is comparable to a mah see one of

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:58,710
the goals to an why we're doing this was

00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:03,240
speeding up to boot process because if

00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:06,150
we can compress the file system if it's

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,330
a smaller that will speed up on the

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:11,070
devices to slow i/o and it's the

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:17,610
compression algorithm that says faster

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:19,730
speed up on low-end CPUs so we've added

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:25,230
a compression algorithm to the counter

00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:28,500
both for image and interim FS at least

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:31,169
in Yama 7 felt in the MBA firm that is

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,270
mostly done by the bootloader net more

00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:37,140
interesting myths we edited to squash

00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:41,720
assess independently the upstream

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,720
project were able to spot in btrfs

00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:48,830
so to the some initial benchmarks we've

00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,830
run or Nike

00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:59,200
their first boot actually has CST a

00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:05,200
little slower than healthy for witches

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:14,530
learn a lot but on the next boots it can

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:17,570
perform for you the interesting bit is

00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:20,300
lettuces on next 15 source beetles again

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:23,330
comparable but interesting business

00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:29,030
distance system image went down from 581

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:35,150
megabytes to 275 so we can save almost

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:38,480
half the space so wrapping that up it

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:41,450
was certainly worth doing and we should

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:46,280
probably keep it up update toast patches

00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:48,800
in us he has to be releases probably

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,470
also investigated as any other places in

00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:55,700
a OSP other than file systems that would

00:32:51,470 --> 00:33:01,130
benefit from this new compression okay

00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:03,430
that's what we had an impression is does

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,430
that mean

00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:09,750
and it's not extreme yet but it's

00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:17,180
working in our releases and it's heading

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:17,180
upstream anything else

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:23,160
no let's move on to you good upstream

00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,050
just

00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:37,100
so hi everyone my name is simple and I

00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:41,630
do and I'd like to provide some week

00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,630
update on you would opportunity

00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:52,929
so just the direction of what work was

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:59,469
done between February

00:33:52,929 --> 00:34:02,759
or I think it's so it was here from the

00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:02,759
second part of

00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:11,710
and what if they purchase

00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:28,879
to actually see the system so it was

00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:32,560
good support for I am 57 ports and the

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,780
world gadgets and narrow path would

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:41,390
Satan needed to variables like Sunnah

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:43,780
and fixing USB controller

00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,780
schools

00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:54,629
you would be dead options so also I had

00:34:51,629 --> 00:35:02,010
a direct partition table so we are able

00:34:54,629 --> 00:35:06,470
to actually put Android later and tricky

00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:10,950
part was with my tenors wanted me to

00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:12,900
actually leave some country copies took

00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,210
a context because you would now is

00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,770
moving to their context of the same is

00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,589
Houston

00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:24,330
so they actually don't accept your

00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:29,130
purchase before you you step up and do

00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:31,920
some previous work with those options if

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:35,980
you want to use those options so I

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:39,280
actually you can see this here

00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:42,400
a lot of options of quarters

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,320
there is actually right now become

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,070
already up but automation Street

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,130
controlled some easy options for you but

00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:54,660
for really hard cases you need to do

00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,660
this semi manual

00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:08,270
okay so on second iteration which was

00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:11,570
done from way to September 2017 I

00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:14,540
actually finished first would support at

00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:17,710
boot on Android phone with MMC 4x15

00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:24,490
world and to the rustle on board as well

00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:24,490
total count of purchases 15 is the same

00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:36,910
what I did is I actually that much that

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:36,910
was pregnant I 300 Hz image and

00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:47,200
I actually did some Satan of variables

00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:53,140
like user data size and security time

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:57,100
port main is all fix some bugs with the

00:36:53,140 --> 00:37:00,280
more gadget and modify it also I am

00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:05,890
going to find some configuration to be

00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:10,660
able to put Android for diversity like

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:16,120
fixing partition table getting commands

00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:19,690
for booting from from FC and I was done

00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:22,030
as well some cultural patches for Moodle

00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:25,080
graphic options and back to the summer

00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:28,080
afternoon and extracting some

00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,080
environments

00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:34,100
because as I said when they are so fun

00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:37,330
want you to actually do some previous

00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:42,880
work and I also have some printed pages

00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:42,880
but I guess will be accepted

00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:54,050
so I was like tested to provide some

00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:58,940
notice from this experience and

00:37:54,050 --> 00:38:01,040
so as I said you just open to do some

00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:05,540
collateral work before you can actually

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:08,360
add some teacher sent and to work what

00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:13,550
you want to do so and that's okay it's

00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:16,660
normal process so you need to work with

00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,660
my containers to do so

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:24,760
yes you also often when you need some

00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:30,130
work you always need to consider in fact

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:34,090
a lot of platforms it actually it

00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:36,640
actually made me rewards not not me some

00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:41,170
other part of my pitch because it

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,210
actually it actually broke broke some

00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,540
other platforms like pick up won't work

00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:49,930
or something so when I doing something

00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:53,590
you really need to think of or test on

00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:56,790
other platforms or think how how it can

00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,790
impact other platforms

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:03,369
is also connected you need to actually

00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:06,520
give your God for all plus our succeed

00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:10,660
any you can see any warnings or errors

00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,550
on that contextually you would have

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:16,380
slice straight for that called the

00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:20,619
beautiful which can automatically be

00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:24,970
matches used to society for all courses

00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:26,140
respite till you actually can do that if

00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,390
you don't want to do that on your

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,900
machine because it can take a lot of

00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:35,920
time you can actually use trade aside

00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:39,119
for this like just call you boot

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:43,109
repository on github github and just

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,109
just run in the trailer side

00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:56,140
also I can say that even though I was

00:39:51,579 --> 00:40:00,160
doing this work was the own by executing

00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:04,020
worked like the half of this work is was

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:08,250
connected to generic code even more

00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:10,750
because as I said you often can be asked

00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:14,880
to do some previous work more like a

00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:19,000
factoring and adding some features

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,510
sentence and so so I can say that doing

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:31,510
this work I just created something you

00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:33,760
can use for other to do so to add this

00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:38,200
the same support for first boot and

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:41,490
control Putin for other platforms so you

00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,490
can use it as a plate

00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:49,550
also I want the way you can come up with

00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:52,100
some useful tools or scripts or

00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:57,020
something like that so you can see if

00:40:52,100 --> 00:41:01,670
this mixes tools tips that provided for

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:03,820
brother to be used for similar job so so

00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:07,460
actually if you need to convert some

00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:10,310
what options to pay conflict there and

00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:12,380
you can you can be asked to so you can

00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:17,380
actually use to those scripts and do

00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,380
this box ever faster

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,710
yes also the good thing the good

00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:26,920
practice is to use commonly used to like

00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:29,530
in demand and to move quantity and so on

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:32,200
you can you can see who's director is to

00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:36,370
its directory read some documentation

00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:42,640
because it can simplify your life like a

00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:46,570
lot and probably the most important

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,220
thing I can say is you need to get a

00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:52,150
quite a bit maintained as you can

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:55,090
discussed things you want to do in IRC

00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:58,030
main press before doing that actually

00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:01,090
because often when you do some things

00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:04,720
they can get rejected because maintainer

00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:07,780
don't want this to be done this way they

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,750
have some very specific way to do those

00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:16,620
things in their minds

00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:16,620
to communicate my main stop

00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:24,400
so other direction Cindy boots can be

00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:30,130
adding some stuff for Android home

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:33,750
support it's different ways in which it

00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:38,160
images under it verified boot support

00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:42,430
and inventor partition and so on and

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:50,520
also for all platforms I'd like to to do

00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:57,760
switching to from from from all TJ a

00:42:50,520 --> 00:43:04,890
serial console of serial regular 88 to

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:08,490
15 which is tjs but this is not properly

00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,490
discussed is maintained

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,400
okay this is importance

00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,440
thank you

00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,880
that's all the topics we have prepared

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,799
yes

00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,199
four minutes left if anyone has any

00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:45,329
other questions in anybody related to

00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:48,739
energy we can take them and it looks

00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:48,739
like our mom thank you

00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:58,010
[Applause]

00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:58,010
