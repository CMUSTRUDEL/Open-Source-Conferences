[Music]

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,759
about this exciting thank you so much

00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:20,770
for attending a lot of you I have

00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:23,619
traveled to come here and having been at

00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,810
connects a lot of exciting things that

00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:29,800
we haven't Storify you hopefully to talk

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:32,230
about one hour and then once I'm done of

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,790
a which relatively quickly we're going

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,040
to lead over to old powers which is

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,960
right what will we do right there

00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,520
probably you can switch this like

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,079
employment very very complex like it's

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,300
gonna be hard for you to follow all of

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,249
us now you're gonna have to basically

00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,579
see if you cannot keep track of what I'm

00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:57,059
missing

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:59,440
this is blocking what it says there I

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,569
think that's just because I actually for

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,729
once made the middle of the picture

00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:09,570
there and my 17100 connects so I was in

00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,570
hell pretty happy about that

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,540
so we've talked to you a little bit

00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:18,130
about obviously the five W's there but

00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,650
before we get there there's a couple w's

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:25,030
that I have bought one of them is

00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:27,310
welcome so much I cannot thank mr. Zane

00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,170
enough for inviting so many students

00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,380
here from the University of San

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,740
Francisco State and all the students

00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,910
just wave their hands up let's test X

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,330
well thank you so much for attending

00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:45,310
we've got a wide mix of people from

00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:47,550
students to CEOs of companies to

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,480
managers to engineers

00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,040
let me ask you just a couple of

00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,650
questions here before we get there

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,500
before I explain one ro and in very

00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,780
basic terms because I am not even an

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,280
engineer hey I'm the person who sort of

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,450
deals with water the people's stuff

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,760
involved in llanera

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,210
I've been with the company about six and

00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,500
a half years the 16th employee and felt

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,320
throw a lot of the company too

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,600
where we're at today and it says in the

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,570
throw of my life Italian it's it's just

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,190
if I could say anything to students

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,890
right now I don't normally get the gist

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,190
our students it's a it's a potentially

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,750
amazing time of your life but it can be

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,280
confusing a little bit right that's the

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,490
way you really want to do I have three

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,230
adult children one is now actually

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:38,750
working for Romero which makes me feel

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:41,270
really old and the other two are trying

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,000
to grow their career or what they want

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,370
to do and they know it's not easy one of

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
the things of being involved with 1rl if

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,540
we could start right here I have one

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,480
thing I've been asked of you is to start

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,610
to know about my marrow and actually you

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,230
have the chance right now to participate

00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,540
with us and that's a lot a lot about

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,480
whatever I was going to talk about which

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,100
is amazing you can get to know having a

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,170
sense of community I was walking with

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,350
one of our engineers the other day and I

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,850
chose earlier today and I asked him if

00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,269
you can think of what would be the one

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,580
message that you would give to students

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:19,640
it would be I wish I knew about Mahara

00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,410
back when I was in school and I wish I

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,600
knew about 96 borders when I was back in

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,430
school because getting involved with a

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,430
community an engineer and it's pretty

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,010
exciting stuff so let me talk a little

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,100
bit about the company we are we were

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,650
formed in June of 2010 not really bad

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,680
older about seven years now we've grown

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:44,769
to 27 countries where do we have people

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,840
in 350 total people involved in the

00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:50,090
company

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,739
everything from employees which makes up

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,220
about half of that number a little bit

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,850
less 150 employees are spread over the

00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,310
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,470
countries and then what we also have is

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,800
what's called member engineers and

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:07,100
assignees what most companies call

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,060
customers we called members and we have

00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:13,400
some amazing member companies I need to

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,150
think of it like the gold silver bronze

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,959
level turbine of membership sweet but

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:23,720
sorry at the top we have core members

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,970
where arm themselves is a member of

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:31,390
webinar and obviously a very important

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:35,150
one as a core member Huawei in China

00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:38,390
corner and Qualcomm is a core member

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,220
treasaor thing then clubs

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,490
everybody from a little company called

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:47,060
Google was everybody heard of them the

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,620
group members the list I didn't go in

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,570
here the reason I thought one thing

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,430
slider them talk to you about is all I'm

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,310
asking you to basically do is to start

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,340
to go tool inaudible as a source if you

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,920
go there you can download our software

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:05,150
mcdonald our tool chain we so heavily

00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:08,000
deal than open source out of curiosity

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,500
just to show them hands and then it's

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,030
such a weird mix cuz I get people who

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,040
actually work will in our listening to

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,960
them listening to be who are the

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,610
incredible engineers and a wide mix of

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
people and then anything from students

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,480
but this is more geared towards students

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,220
or perhaps all over this is your first

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,060
time being involved with honor

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:32,870
prior to sort of being solicited if you

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:34,370
will for me have you heard of Lamar one

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,240
in and heard of Lamar

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,830
under the heard of 96 fours what's

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,300
really funny as nice as Ford's is a

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,950
little baby it's one of our little

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,440
babies and when our it was the parent

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:50,960
company right so this is my cute little

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:54,969
baby right here is me so it's amazing to

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,939
me that it's not hot yet

00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:00,819
not in your school perhaps about hula

00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:04,809
narrow this because we're all about open

00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:07,689
source software our honor I'm hoping

00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:09,459
that most people know what arm is are

00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:14,860
the people that be honest see not go

00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:16,239
with arms you know that it's basically

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,249
intellectual property

00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:20,249
it's the cymatics if you will to build

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:31,080
when

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:33,330
I think about arm we're reaching out to

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,650
the whole world and with the efforts

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,180
that when I was doing that we have

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,159
obvious is that arm is doing

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,770
you know that arm is now the most recent

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:44,550
static this is a hundred billion devices

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:47,039
across the world I mean think about it

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,740
you're using it every day you're driving

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,469
a relatively new car and you're looking

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,639
at fifteen to twenty different parts of

00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:58,349
your car that's powered by arm I was

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,150
lucky enough about a year ago to

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:01,740
actually be right up here in the Santa

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,800
Clara Convention Center for our tech

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,949
bond and i saw the CEO of Softbank

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,620
who just recently purchased arm about at

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:13,490
that time which was about a year ago for

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,129
a measly thirty two billion dollars i

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:21,629
think thirty two billion dollars he

00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:23,849
purchased and his speech was amazing and

00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,249
I was expected to not understand it I'm

00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,529
not an engineer I'm kind of what I do

00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:31,110
for an hour is are sort of the people

00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:33,120
person hopefully I deal with getting

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,129
everybody into the company from the

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,680
hiring perspective or recruitment to

00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:39,419
being involved with our HR being

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,439
involved to it with our training the

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:45,990
people activities that we do because

00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,339
it's a very engineering driven company

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,879
that's what I hear all the time you know

00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:52,050
what amazing engineers and and we do you

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,749
know one of the greatest things about

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,379
Lamar if I was like a student or I was

00:07:54,749 --> 00:08:01,740
looking to come to the company I think

00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:05,219
about the fact that if I got to work and

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:08,669
I remember mention to w's one of them

00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:12,569
was welcome that's a lot the other W is

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:14,699
the warning I might sound because I was

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,860
so used to this I might sound like I'm

00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,629
trying to sell you I'm sorry I'm

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,639
somewhat in sales has been in the whole

00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,889
career I've been in recruiting for

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,050
longer than half of my life I'm not

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,490
trying to sell you I'm not trying to

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,409
 with nothing in here giving you

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,699
stuff away we're not trying to charge

00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,020
you money for anything we're trying to

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,000
give you the free life please seminar

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,519
we're giving you giveaways you're gonna

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,659
learn about ninety six floors so if I'm

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,169
sounding like I'm selling you just

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,169
kidding

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:57,120
so that's my one my other is my accent

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:57,689
is so leading into breaking down the

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
company

00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:01,050
it's one of those things that I have to

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,209
do when I'm talking to new engineers

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,970
that companies with a company one of the

00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:08,610
important things is try to understand a

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,939
little bit of different terminologies so

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:15,120
as I mentioned we call customers members

00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:17,069
what most companies call engineering we

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,800
can break down to our working groups and

00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:21,029
our segment groups our working groups

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,870
are some of the things that are

00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:27,870
basically leading some of the best

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,519
engineers in the world work form my

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,529
telling I'm selling there I'm not I

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,990
didn't actually back it up by statistics

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,930
because a lot of our engineers are

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,060
involved in open-source and Lennar o is

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,069
typically one of the top five companies

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,490
in the whole world

00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:46,470
contributing to open source specifically

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,980
Linux kernel and the Android Open Source

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,890
a OSP so yeah I mean with the work that

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:58,079
our engineering to do is really truly

00:09:52,890 --> 00:10:01,709
incredible it's so amazing for me to

00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,870
work with such bright people if I was

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:06,779
looking to come to an RL where I was

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,120
looking to learn about Lenara and I

00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:12,630
could get exposed at your age to the

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,939
community and actually to give you the

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:19,410
guidance from some of the most senior

00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:22,079
engineers and the arm ecosystem would be

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,699
a great experience so what I really want

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,500
you to do is I want you to just get

00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:28,010
another

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:32,580
Lennar Oh a little bit further so our

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:35,270
our main core team is basically our

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,160
kernel engineers our power management

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:41,690
our security and our virtualization

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,100
teams it also had sentiment groups

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,590
sentiment groups was started in like

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,010
November of 2012 we started out with the

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:52,350
Romero Enterprise Group and that is all

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,710
about which is it's evolved but a basis

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,920
of the original thought was basically

00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:01,200
empowering servers and the enterprise

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:06,390
more with arm so it's more powered by

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,310
harm than Intel before then we've broken

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,140
some success of the Lonardo enterprise

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,760
group and it was great and we started

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,400
getting involved with what we'd have

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,730
building our networking group we have

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,370
the lonardo home group we have a whole

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,850
team of engineers dedicated to low-level

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,380
Android and basically the global group

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,720
the whole group is basically dealing

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,890
with like set-top box industry Comcast's

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,950
as a member I had Comcast at my house

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:39,860
loggers that is Comcast a big one okay

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:45,570
okay I don't know so then we also have

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:47,340
white back to the the presentation that

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,630
I'd like to see about a year ago from

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,700
the CEO of Softbank his reason for

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,240
purchasing on him for thirty two billion

00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:01,260
dollars was all about the Internet of

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,330
Things and who wants to get armed he

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:08,520
talks about bringing it to one trillion

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:10,050
devices and that's truly amazed even if

00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,640
he only you know

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,830
be really ambitious and had a lot of

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,839
vision maybe the only ghost oh just a

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,610
measly you know five hundred billion or

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,110
something like that of just sick where

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,480
arm is everywhere aren't affects

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,160
everyday you rate your house turn your

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,649
lights on and if their power that can be

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,360
very well powered by by the Internet of

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:29,160
Things which hopefully is going to have

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,810
more and more involvement as it already

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,550
does with arm so the different segments

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:40,260
groups to make together segments group

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:46,320
of to get slight Elliott King when our

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:48,209
mobile group then we also do some

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,870
specific work so pretty much all of our

00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:57,350
engineers work in open source some I say

00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,570
all of us took ground water some of them

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:04,019
of working on products that are so

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,420
bleeding edge that eventually want they

00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,370
want open source stuff so if our member

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,810
companies will work with like developer

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,670
services is the other part of our

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,260
company a lot of our engineer a lot of

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,510
companies call professional services we

00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,950
call developer services and actually

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:22,200
that's a relatively new manager called

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:24,209
member services when you think about

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,570
back to our core members how am i doing

00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:33,089
on time you think about back to our core

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:34,860
members we probably never gonna truly

00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,720
see this I thought our CTO was gonna be

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,910
here as he was around at that time but I

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,730
don't think necessarily anywhere in

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:45,540
Matthew 41 about Luke roundish do you

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:49,160
think llanera would be in business if it

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,160
wasn't because of the very beginning

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:03,269
solution to the our people the

00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:03,269
foundation of course

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,580
the vision of a partnership

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,670
if I think about arm and the involvement

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,750
with Lennar it's really like our top

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:29,200
relationship right up there as one of

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:32,610
those core members and even us a couple

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:39,430
years ago would having a hard time

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:42,730
getting high-powered efficient 64-bit

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:47,710
ARM boards for an arm at a reasonable

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,660
price so what can be amazing in the

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,300
engineering world is that you can come

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,510
up with an idea and the idea was

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,300
basically where 96 Forks came from and

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,360
we started it with just thought of only

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,720
seasonal thought of building boards that

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,140
would help our developers and now as

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,840
Robert will expand on greatly today and

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,490
our elite team of people that will sit

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,600
on the panel for the open house show

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:19,060
that will do he will extend on 96 boards

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,420
is how it's really starting to grow and

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,940
affect the whole world we have it being

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,250
used all over region there are many

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,040
different places and South America in

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,230
Brazil and throughout the u.s. and

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,610
Canada or in Europe and it's just

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,700
starting from a little idea just a

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,470
couple years ago so that's what we can

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,390
happen in the engineering world because

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,630
that's really probably the most thing

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,910
that helps sell me about Vanara is that

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,700
our company really helps change the

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,380
world we really are being involved with

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,720
is the wide width

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:57,310
we are and being able to power up

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,380
everything from if in the linux world

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,980
and having some of the greatest Linux

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,320
kernel engineers all the way through all

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,910
the wide width of things that we do both

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,620
now a little bit of hardware yeah we

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,020
don't make the boards ourselves what we

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,300
do is we hold the spec we design the

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,370
board and our member companies work with

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,010
us to start building the boys a driver

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,240
will talk about but I also just want to

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,530
talk about Robert before he gets a

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,750
chance to talk about Robert is he has

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,820
done an incredible job as our community

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:31,740
manager so proud of him he's one of the

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:34,990
employees that I originally hired and

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,400
the way that he has grown a lot of

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,470
others and several other people you can

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,020
assist people in this room have grown 96

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,360
ports to almost be out there was a

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:48,040
strange show and when we saw 196 people

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:51,040
know about these boys on one hour but I

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:56,800
really commend him Robert lives in San

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:59,620
Diego he's truly a graduate of San Diego

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,430
us unique you suggest even that was the

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,680
time he's destined not long ago he's

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:10,420
still a young guy so it's pretty amazing

00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,069
what he's got involved with and the

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,350
other engineers that are in the company

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,449
and that are involved with her company

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,189
I'm just looking at John Babcock Hall

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,780
sitting right here in front of me this

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,420
is literally sort of famous in the

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:26,220
engineering world I mean he's been I

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,220
think you created engineer

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,230
look up lots of different things and

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:44,159
generals involved with that in closing

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,929
over to Robert here again all you're

00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:47,250
really trying to do I didn't want to

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:48,630
bore you with the whole bunch of size

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:54,020
neither does Ronnie

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:58,289
Robert irqs the accent miss I'm Robert

00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:01,440
he I the whole reason is to make you

00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:05,909
more aware about the motto go to Lamar

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:09,450
or go to our downloads page go to our

00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:12,270
would go to so many parts read about our

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,280
member companies we are thinking very

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,210
very seriously I started remember the

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,630
three different levels

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,520
we now have an associate level which is

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,010
a lot more affordable to universities

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,799
and small companies so I can talk to

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,409
people after this gladly stay as long as

00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:32,909
you want about you know how could my

00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:35,669
university how could we do things a

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:37,559
little bit further with you and and

00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:38,820
Robert will talk a little bit about some

00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,059
of the things were already doing in some

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,250
other universities any quick questions

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:56,580
on one hour before we move over to 96

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:59,100
ports okay great thank you so yeah as

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,470
mine says my name is Arnold and I am v96

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:05,040
Porter's community manager but I've

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,960
already done this several times about

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,060
I think this is now the third time I'll

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,800
be doing this and I always get back home

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,140
and I realize they actually try to take

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,240
a selfie really running so if that's

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:20,850
okay I'm going to just do this and I

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:25,890
don't copy like what you wouldn't mind

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:29,910
just kind of smiling or something all

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:32,820
right thank you very much as Mike

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:36,720
pointed out are you talking about

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:40,620
96 quarts now the baby of Menard oh

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,480
right this was created mmm

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,100
not by me it was created before a joint

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,100
even or in fact in 2015

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,950
bunch of great minds got together

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,900
including our CEO from Adaro big-time

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,480
people from our member companies got

00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,660
together and said we need to drive the

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,230
cost of arm development platforms down

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:07,290
not only me to drive across town but we

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,760
need to make these chips easily really

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,770
because even if the console is one we

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,430
can't buy it then doesn't know good

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:17,010
right so reducing the lead times and

00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,990
reducing the cost of arm development and

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,000
this is where 96 words came from the

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,590
idea of 96 for today I'm going to ask

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,940
the question here who is familiar with

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:30,900
the Raspberry Pi many more hands than

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,100
the 96 Lords question right what I would

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,020
like to do throughout this presentation

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,160
is gave a couple takeaways through the

00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,640
beginning so you can think about it

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:42,150
first is how does 96 board is different

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,830
from Raspberry Pi and other platforms

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,620
that you may have already heard of since

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:49,900
apparently

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:53,320
for their death and what can 96 words do

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,360
for you right as well as myself no I do

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,660
for you

00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,610
so 96 boards specifications might hinted

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:04,290
at to the fact that 96 where does not

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:07,120
hardware company we pull a hardware

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,020
specification and I stole this from mr.

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,200
Mad Dogs

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,059
John Madden halls article I believe it

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,760
was done years ago in 96 words from

00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,950
launch people think opening hardware

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,200
specifications right well I put these

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,220
quotations around here because it is not

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,520
open hardware specification but rather

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,590
open hardware specifications okay so the

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,059
specification itself is open not

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,710
necessarily all the hardware that's not

00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,300
a bad thing it's a good thing because

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,950
that means that the people who develop

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:41,020
the hardware are coming together in a

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:44,110
and I want to say a progressive way to

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,179
push these specifications into the right

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:49,030
place we want these specifications to be

00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:51,640
good for everyone and as long as other

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,490
people are involved then hopefully this

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:58,360
is what happens so oh there you go miss

00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:00,700
Barrett that's the 196 words olds 3

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,440
specifications currently one which is

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,780
the consumer edition and this is the one

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,540
that you're most likely be familiar with

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,140
sort of maker or or just out of

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,470
hobbyists

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,820
and then you have an Enterprise Edition

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,020
and another two editions now for anyone

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,370
who would like to read more about this

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,230
you can always go to the ninety-six

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,520
boards website that uses port org and

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,690
there is a tab there or specifications

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,960
schematics pipelines everything you need

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:29,230
to follow the 96 port specification but

00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,800
what is the point of the specification

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,950
and anyone if you have a question in the

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,230
middle of this very informal I'm wearing

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,610
it sure you know does everything is an

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,830
informal conversation if you have

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:48,880
anything that you want to talk about the

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:50,560
specification allows us and our member

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,160
companies anyone who wants to get

00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,660
involved including the community to

00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:02,680
develop around a universal footprint and

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:05,170
a set of different associates now let me

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,390
kind of elaborate on this little more if

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:13,180
you are developing on a for instance

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:15,760
let's use it again guys thirty buddy you

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,590
are working on a certain ship and as you

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,040
continue your development on this chip

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,240
say maybe it's not the chip you wanted

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,090
where you want to go and sand to

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,740
something a little bit stronger or if

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,480
you didn't need something so strong you

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,040
want to go something lower right well

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,380
having a series of ninety-six boards

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,440
that have a there's one hand on either a

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,850
more Universal footprint believe it or

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,220
not every single one of these boards

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:48,120
have a different ARM chip on them right

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,120
so you can transfer your development

00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,450
yeah anyway so you can you can put your

00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,760
you can transfer your development

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,850
seamlessly across the arm ecosystem okay

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,520
uses different chips and the current in

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:09,380
ecosystems that exists in with 96 words

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,330
now I'm not going to really

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:15,860
much on this because the main goal of

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,870
this whole conversation is to spark

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,140
questions hopefully you have questions

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:23,180
for me but I also want to leave of the

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,790
half an hour or 20 minutes for a small

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:30,740
meet-and-greet and a lot of time for our

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:34,210
panelists to come up here but tackling

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,990
the ninety six boards ecosystem and

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,340
consuming the ninety six boards

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:44,210
ecosystem is something that allows not

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:46,130
only transferable development but in

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,190
some cases and I'm going to use for

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,920
example a this board up here Jeff board

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:54,260
for Tennessee and now he Ford has all

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,630
sorts of different benefits to their

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,610
boards ready to allow companies to

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,730
accent certain things but this was

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,620
recently announced last year the church

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,360
set on the diving board allows for long

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,630
life development okay

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,120
so imagine now you have a ship they

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:15,080
indicated develop on but for purposes

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,180
that extend a one or two year need right

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,860
now the amount of time that all God

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,190
needs offering support for this chip

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,420
Snapdragon 410 II is 10 years right I

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,070
mean if you're developing something in

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,380
the medical field you're not going to

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,410
get it out in a year you've got all

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,610
sorts of things you do get something out

00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,800
of medical field or for that matter

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,150
anything that involves people's lives so

00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:42,020
there's a lot of development that that

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:43,820
caters to this type of chip now that's

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,440
just one example and I could go on and

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:50,630
on for these different examples but I

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,790
want to talk about the specification

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,250
itself just a little more pause for

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,170
questions

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,400
No okay so we're just going to address a

00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,960
little bit more about what makes this

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,909
best

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,989
as produce the standard footprint the

00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:09,509
standard footprint is our way of

00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:12,299
bringing out the essential components of

00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:14,639
each chip okay now when you're talking

00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:18,269
about development you have basic iOS

00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:20,879
GPIO I to see spi uart right all these

00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:24,090
audios that you would need now there's

00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:28,889
no sense for a company to go in and

00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:33,149
create a board that tries to make

00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:35,730
themselves special in a GPIO like no

00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:37,409
unibody everyone can have the same she

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,600
goes everybody put it on the same

00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:41,970
headers that's not something you're

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,909
going to necessarily sell to someone but

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,119
you will sell other things that make

00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:50,669
yourself special right and this allows

00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:54,179
chip makers and manufacturers to team up

00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:56,700
and build a product with minimal

00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:59,190
redundancies in the market so like I

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,379
said in standard footprint SOC

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,289
independent again I'm touching on the

00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:06,919
same thing you can transfer or you could

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:09,509
put any SOC on the same platform now

00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,090
pre-existing ecosystem is 96 ports

00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:15,090
continues to grow and with your help as

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:17,970
community members you jump into an

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,359
ecosystem that is already very

00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:25,049
flourishing and I'd like to pride myself

00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:29,960
not on the numbers okay now 96 points is

00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:33,389
it huge one day baby I love that but our

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,239
community is engaging and strong and

00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:37,769
that is what matters so even in this

00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,909
room I'm looking out here and I see

00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:41,460
people that I deal with on a weekly

00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,929
sometimes is in daily basis right here

00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,549
Michael welding in particular Mad Dog

00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,220
I'm not getting into when I shouldn't

00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:49,230
even started but there's people in here

00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,620
that are fully committed to the 96

00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,120
boards ecosystem and

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,650
want to see it grow just as much as

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:58,150
everyone else and that's the difference

00:27:53,650 --> 00:28:00,490
between numbers and engagement so we

00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:03,690
have a very Asian community this

00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:06,850
pre-existing ecosystem comes with it

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:10,210
working initiatives because we have such

00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:12,600
brown and engaging people initiatives

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:17,380
just keep popping up left and right now

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:19,390
myself along with many people in this

00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,940
room and who might be joining us online

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,580
later during open hours as well as our

00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,290
panelists have taken upon themselves to

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,179
start meaningful initiatives project

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,059
organizations community mezzanine

00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:32,710
projects allowing a community to form

00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:37,540
around different aspects of this

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:39,340
ecosystem which is very needed in some

00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,490
cases you can go search for something

00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:45,160
online and not know exactly what's right

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:47,140
until you're picking through page after

00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,190
page after page finally something works

00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,280
okay I found it

00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,530
nice but when you go to 96 words

00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,580
hopefully everything is consolidated and

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,540
has been checked by the right people

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,190
because we have such an amazing

00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,420
community and these initiatives

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:05,020
help drive the story engaging community

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,400
and strong industry partners so as my

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,290
contention if you have different groups

00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,580
and some big companies involved and I

00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,160
don't want to start rounding off names

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,650
because there are a lot and there are a

00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,840
lot of very important names you can go

00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,640
to the one on that work website 96 Ford

00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,250
Thunderbird website read about pages and

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,790
you'll find lists of companies that are

00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:27,880
involved with us and they all care about

00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:30,760
what you want they all listen and they

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,760
listen because we provide them the

00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,050
channel to listen and this is something

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,510
that I found very beautiful right and I

00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,580
only recently graduated college I think

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,220
two years ago now

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,409
okay not that long ago and I had not

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,200
really been involved in open source in

00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:51,720
fact in college I thought I was more the

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,220
paper engineer the kind who does all the

00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:58,590
engineering on paper right well I would

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,029
like to push and encourage all of you

00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,679
the students in particular they're

00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:03,509
definitely industry professionals in

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,249
here but the students in particular all

00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:07,980
they push all of you to start engaging

00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:09,720
in practical application right and what

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,539
better practical application in the open

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,450
source world on platforms that are

00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:17,909
sponsored and provided by the leading

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:21,059
industries that are driving this

00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:24,059
movement forward right so that's my

00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:26,489
takeaway from this and I know I might

00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:29,399
have not been explained 96 points so

00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:30,869
much in a nutshell but if there are any

00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,789
questions I'd be glad to answer it

00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:35,100
before we go into that I just want to

00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:37,859
say that we will go into like a 30

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,899
minute wall here I hope that all you

00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:41,429
stick around it's very important to me

00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:44,730

are actually very big company grant

00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:58,739
likely from arm so we keep throwing out

00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,710
this word arm if you have any questions

00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:04,039
about arm he's got to ask he's also from

00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:08,519

00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:09,989
