Session Name: Automatic Vectorization in ART (Android RunTime) - SFO17-216
Speaker: Aart Bik, Artem Serov
Track: LMG


★ Session Summary ★
Because all modern general-purpose CPUs support small-scale SIMD
instructions (typically between 64-bit and 512-bit), modern compilers
are becoming progressively better at taking advantage of SIMD
instructions automatically, a translation often referred to as
vectorization or SIMDization. Since the Android O release, the
optimizing compiler of ART has joined the family of vectorizing
compilers with the ability to translate bytecode into native SIMD code
for the target Android device. This talk will discuss the general
organization of the retargetable part of the vectorizer, which is
capable of automatically finding and exploiting vector instructions in
bytecode without committing to one of the target SIMD architectures
yet (currently ARM NEON (advanced SIMD), x86 SSE, and MIPS SIMD
Architecture). Furthermore the talk will present particular details of
deploying the vectorizing compiler on ARM platforms - its overall
impact on performance, some ARM specific considerations and
optimizations - and also will give an update on Linaro ART team's
SIMD-related activities.
