	Session ID: SFO17-302
Session Name: BFQ, fairness and low latency in block I/O - The Two Towers - SFO17-302
Speaker: 
Track: Kernel


★ Session Summary ★
The BFQ I/O scheduler has been finally ported to blk-mq, and merged
 into the kernel (from 4.12). We start the first part of this
 presentation by recalling motivations and benefits of BFQ. Then we
 report the developments occurred since BFQ has been ported to blk-mq
 and upstreamed: fixes of important bugs, further throughput
 improvements for flash-based storage, public performance reports. In
 the second part of the presentation, we deal with the near future of
 BFQ, characterized by two great challenges. The first is to keep
 throughput high, while, at the same time, providing strong guarantees
 on fairness, bandwidth distribution and latency. The second great
 challenge is to achieve this combined goal with the low overhead
 imposed by modern devices. As a last part, we try to have a look at
 the future of BFQ, and of the latency issues that still affect many,
 if not most Linux-based systems
