[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,590
so this would be enough streaming buff I

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,240
have no slice so hopefully it's much

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,260
easier visit us having other slides

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,029
which is bullet points of anyone so

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,800
basically this is to see if we have

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,810
anybody wants to talk about anything

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,989
going on with qualifying shifts in the

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:40,559
middle also is cussing you open issues

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:42,150
you have or trying to resolve this I can

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,250
go through bullet points if you want or

00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:48,840
people and just recently has or be

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,920
excited they talk about anybody have any

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,320
interest in talking about a topic

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,739
otherwise looks good for my to listen

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,739
last time

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,280
[Music]

00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,100
I think we do have some more mess and

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:13,270
then new topics but maybe not the right

00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:25,660
people so there's a promise of you that

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:27,100
you want talk about that we can come

00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,210
back to that I mean that's probably

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:47,650
after some of the basic

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:49,920
okay so from my list I just start with

00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,240
what we call basic or inside a company

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,520
and for the previous time it was like

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,000
really shocking fo which is to amend

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,650
them for whatever call and the person

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,020
who was working on that company is now

00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:06,340
gone basically absorbent code and that

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:13,260
was just kind of hanging out a lot of us

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,260
have that path step yeah

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:28,290
okay well it's the other Brian dude

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:29,790
psychinfo the last time robbers robbers

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,349
blocking the sockets myself because of

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:41,730
some PT even banging things actually

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:46,440
yeah the problem is for the sake the one

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,790
driver allows or has the scissors in

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,799
your face reshaping the version of

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,989
equality from farmers of all the

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,989
different pieces and Rob quite clearly

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,750
wanted that individual drivers today is

00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,730
P driver should have a DSP version or

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,370
p.rajesh that well pendrive an inversion

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,010
and the TC driver share the TC version

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,780
and that makes a lot of sense unless you

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,849
actually look at the practical side of

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,480
things that there is no reading or

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:15,299
enterprise and there is no reality see

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,510
brighter or there isn't one DC driver

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:19,799
please and promote these things there

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:23,910
there is something good place for them

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,170
and we actually need this right or we

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,519
need this interface because they were

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,410
done then we get the question join a

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:36,120
group loader do we actually run when you

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:38,489
report this bug and there is no that's

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,410
like we Waltons but it's for that use

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,030
case having device s

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,269
where's the code and we can think it we

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,620
can think about this scissor vest ABI

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,609
two years from now or never crashing

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,410
unit hello

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:53,430
I already talked about the know who used

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,340
to be so we kind of is using me a guy

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,800
that also be useful

00:03:55,340 --> 00:05:30,919
I'm pretty sure that there's a

00:03:57,800 --> 00:05:33,260
oh yeah the the saddest part is that in

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,200
every cycle there is some stupid K

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,010
config thing that aren't fines not sure

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,330
if that's the specific thing that you

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,450
and I wish I did give you the

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:47,480
opportunity in every kernel release not

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,740
always you other people yeah but I am

00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,770
responsible for giving you the

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,770
opportunity

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,860
okay next student every management and

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:06,760
SMU which is basically that's what

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:08,770
happens but before we talk about the

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,300
last time we talked about CMA and let me

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:18,700
because I don't think any of that was

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:21,130
important in the in the to puke rubber

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,140
well like we had the same part in the

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:27,850
different instructor at the feed you

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:34,420
know for the way that one work uploaded

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:38,620
through skim a I think the patch that

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:43,240
were that was just it was merged the

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:46,360
other yeah and then I talked to Steven

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,100
because we have more or less exactly the

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,960
same set up in the field of drivers and

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:56,110
there's a huge problem in the fact that

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:58,090
after after you have jumped into trust

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,090
zone you're not allowed to touch that

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:06,550
memory I'm not sure if that's the same

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:09,910
for for the video or for the GPU but if

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:15,580
you speculatively touch me

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:18,640
you will see instantly do so downstream

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,750
that solved by having a DMA allocation

00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:25,020
we can specify that it's torn order

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:32,430
humanity white and upstream we don't

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:34,650
have that so the problem apparently is

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,540
that the specification for the front

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,310
with that face just says that he put the

00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,630
address of the Papa here but it doesn't

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,430
say without that it's a bunch of that

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,470
we're sorry' physical address our

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,370
address is seen by a device that would

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,570
mean specified because it's just not

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,320
loudly fighting what the interface

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,870
actually is supposed to be this is about

00:07:52,320 --> 00:08:08,250
the pill memory nervous that's all

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:09,810
fizzes to touch it because the drivers

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,440
what would they use the DMA address

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,000
problem the drive assisted EMA address

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,500
drug event physical reference there

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,180
should happen to be the same by trunks

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:27,630
because it wasn't using an iPhone you

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:28,890
get okay just be things that might come

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,220
back if someone else could be the same

00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:36,680
quarter

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:41,000
okay I think okay so now she bought the

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,560
SMU discussion or when I had one here is

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,330
this clogging power management and fall

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,830
handle stuff is my well those are still

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,830
[Music]

00:08:50,320 --> 00:09:00,060
yeah so super close but there has been

00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:03,300
some iterations on

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,390
RFC's for how to handle the power

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,000
management so the door management side

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:13,050
is only one of a bunch of things but

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,680
mainly we don't want to have to give

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,750
runtime get

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,750
[Music]

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,710
so there was a proposal Alex

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:34,339
validating the TLB before the powers off

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,339
so that we don't have to do it on that

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,120
at that closely I don't have I've been

00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:45,120
mostly like

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:56,490
yeah mostly like in the authors discuss

00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:59,620
up a clear topic and see what that cuz I

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,570
mean I think there's two different kind

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,750
of use cases the arm guys have been my

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,750
furnace and the one is like the network

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,279
driver where you're always going to have

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,870
the device on when you're on mapping

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,529
things and you want to be above map

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,240
things from potentially I'm calming the

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:21,160
space you don't have to do a key at one

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,050
time get in the oh and you driver the

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,060
other cases of GPU driver where

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,070
unbalanced might that may be under

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,720
control user space that happened long

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,720
after the GPUs are each off

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,110
it'll never be called in an atomic

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,910
context but we don't want to have to

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,910
have the whole GPU just

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,839
I think the issue there I think that

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,690
particular issues understood will get

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,990
sorted out somehow

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:54,020
and you say I'm napping with the camera

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,600
with the unliving all that synchronously

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,830
on this program could be hospitalized

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:04,810
I'm not let me do another I don't use

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:08,810
double change the whole generation so I

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:16,460
would actually like I mean I kind of a

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:17,930
fan of the asynchronous stuff because it

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,820
would take some more work and then GPU

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,750
dry-rotted need to keep the pages back

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:26,240
in the buffer around after I'm not you

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,920
don't need to it's just you you would

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,690
trust the hardware not to access those

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,400
addresses which we usually do anyway if

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,740
you don't have an SMU you also possible

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,530
to have a dozen Texas State Parties I

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,170
mean this is that the hardware accesses

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,430
are probably under control a user space

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:55,310
so no I don't trust

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:57,770
oh it uses the okay yes I think not

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:03,080
because I mean you can be used in very

00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:07,480
different ways this is just for the GPU

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,480
with GPU always wants to do those faces

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:13,160
yeah I mean there would be performance

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,380
advantages to batching on maps and

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,160
consolidating to one Tod invalidate said

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:30,030
during a synchronously I think something

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:32,900
wrong reduce today and anyway I mean

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,900
there's discussion about

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,360
less worry about that I think some of

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,290
the bigger questions are

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,120
when he said adding her process page

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,490
tables for the GPS

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,380
[Music]

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,830
you know your GLX tears process of a

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,720
different gpio space from your server or

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,330
something like that a different address

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,700
based on the GPU so they don't at the

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,880
moment and think they could they kind of

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,490
don't at the moment doing so involves

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,910
things like the GPU changing the page

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,910
table

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:18,060
yeah separate page tables we need to be

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,130
able to program separate page tables and

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,070
then tell the GPU switch to this

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,940
physical address and then back and forth

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,100
back and forth

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:30,510
so with this GPU share the page tables

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,220
with the CPU that's way beyond is kind

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,800
of a more of a server thicknesses or

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:43,830
just trying to maintain a separate space

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:46,920
for everybody at anyone it's not like so

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:54,270
I think the directions were part of the

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:57,090
block generates some a some hardware ID

00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:01,260
of the street in their request so that

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,570
you yeah the single set of page tables

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,190
and handle multiple possible it for the

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,800
current stuff that GPUs really only

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,060
running one thing at a time

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,060
so you don't have

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:20,120
treating every accesses for GLX gears

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:22,910
and axle so it's a little bit different

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,430
from one talked about so far as or it's

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,430
SP a recipe I shouldn't say

00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,260
is it more even above that's another you

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:52,980
need to break out and explain okay how

00:14:50,180 --> 00:15:01,699
how the drivers are supposed to work and

00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:03,769
then CPI okay yeah I mean API expect me

00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:06,899
tested for a number of years because

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:14,029
there's just no current API to do what

00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:14,029
everybody needs that's not very good

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,930
so I Lisa assume you be how much ever

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:32,970
purchased us and how we have SMU

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:35,340
everywhere I said Q comma only you for

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:39,690
like the I guess you call it early a

00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:43,500
family stuff it is merged now so we're

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:48,810
using four ten that we should have very

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:51,440
be able to use it for whatever a 974 I

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:56,220
gave it a spin on that night stated for

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,260
it doesn't seem like me so several this

00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,580
this is 4-bit register seems to be

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,980
32-bit on a message for and what goes in

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:08,340
upper 32 bits correctly I think the a

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:11,970
seed ID writing that that there is

00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:15,540
instant reboot so I had to fill it with

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,720
the driver to get past a program we

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,720
might

00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:36,020
I guess she's very popular with you

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:36,020
no I mean SSH - okay

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:47,300
all right I have eye on Mexico I don't

00:16:45,629 --> 00:17:04,439
know what we talked about for

00:16:47,300 --> 00:17:11,220
specifically okay I didn't anything at

00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:14,339
ion about PC yeah okay so his best to be

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,730
except in LBC and XTC so there's been a

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,829
bit of finding this question in general

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,260
I think the consensus from community is

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,909
been beautiful - good nobody's been

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,559
jumping up and down the same don't do

00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:28,020
things with it I think it's good

00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,570
progress I think the biggest thing is

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,419
move towards own splitting the ion Adi

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:36,630
towards one ion towards death

00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:39,120
zero - whatever just for ease of lock

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,320
things down I've also had some offline

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,760
discussions about other requirements

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,710
mostly the biggest thing that's come up

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,440
is that supporting various parts of the

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,320
secured data paths are tricky to get

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,049
right in while still getting the right

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,580
layer of abstraction biggest issue I was

00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:59,789
thinking about right now is the fact

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,190
that DMF is supposed to be for generic

00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:04,880
buffers but my head Lions can use is

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,740
been a full time period for it was this

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,970
secure just a whole lot of secure proper

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,159
state so trying to figure out the right

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,950
level of abstraction there to do that I

00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:19,380
think is going to be the biggest issue

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:21,900
there I think as far as other generic on

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,600
up streaming stuff

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:31,830
what heaps are the biggest ones submit

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:33,810
that you want to add anything else okay

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:39,510
yeah that's remotely different

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:42,180
completely should be terminated so I

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,580
have my Listeria for parametric okay

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,200
that's kind with anything was to do and

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,060
so looks like there was our EMG link

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,680
which i think is now merged that's all

00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,920
good to go

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:55,980
there was a suspense stuff which never

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,570
happened like Andy's reconnected you had

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,360
dropped off stop doing it

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,770
so there's a whole suspect path that's

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:07,640
not being supported that there was this

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:11,880
looks like kind of any kind of mail

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,770
mismanagement of TV freak I think most I

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,570
got stuck

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,730
this was also free and a 60p for you

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,930
kind of know what this task that is a

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,989
Jewish woman or was you know

00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,989
[Music]

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,980
yeah

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:34,260
okay somebody that you picked back up

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,440
again soon I think the co-founders real

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,440
team

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:40,989
so we should expect to see a how many

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,960
complicated CP free dry rot none of us

00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:46,779
is actually for the Koala I'm not sure

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,970
when I like that's awesome let's do this

00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:52,809
then we have the clock and voltage

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:55,720
scaling DSS we've had Thresh working on

00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:58,960
that topic the agenda I want to talk

00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:06,669
about this at all yeah this would be

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:09,849
corners in the world so I think this is

00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:14,559
the performance gate patches that

00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:18,580
has been looking up I've been trying to

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:23,590
use those and try to model the part of a

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:27,460
tribal economist be the there are a

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:30,820
couple of things one there are no GD

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,440
mining so it needs to be in the part of

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,999
Maine where is the part of a tribal

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,830
Minister now look up at evil and stupid

00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:43,749
coming from the device two years to

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:46,510
which corner maps to what frequency and

00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:52,630
so on so all that is

00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:55,630
which means that the other thing is we

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:59,020
have cases where devices for that

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,360
multiple corners which means we need to

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:21,720
associate multiple partners to devices

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:27,670
power support for associated I mean I

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:30,370
think it's father Mark were using the

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,580
regulator framework then eventually it

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,580
was

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,960
the apartments would be the right place

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,670
then we had this issue because

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,550
associated more than apartment to a

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,550
place this part

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:55,559
so there's problems we can't dissociate

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,840
or the one part made to a device but

00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,900
that that seems a solid like a solvable

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,280
problem the bigger problem is that

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,030
indicates where we go for what's the

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,650
performance of that device my won by

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,600
Bill devices needs to go for two

00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:13,080
different levels on the joopa remains

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,780
and I don't want that or it can't have

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,900
that time to be a runtime state of the

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,900
device

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,970
yes sir do these sell most of all my

00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,360
hunting stuff is about idle management's

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:52,640
arrested indeed get my sweater but

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:57,500
squeeze desimilus I'm very disgusted is

00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:01,130
on marriages on flowers recently we had

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:05,180
a quick chat with Rafael and opium core

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:08,840
because about adding a support for

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,500
what's called power plants and it got

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,620
started

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,510
sometimes during a discussion that we

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,410
have so we're trying to pick up that

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:20,600
power yet because interest before yeah

00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:24,740
there's much going on that he seems to

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:28,280
be like media focuses us we should shoot

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,290
over to pick that up again so we want to

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:34,460
continue over the bar remains James like

00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:36,830
the performance tables without without

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,220
considering this if you want to count

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:43,760
the third performance today P is gonna

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:47,750
take into account I think it could be

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:51,260
multiple polygons associated to finish

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,960
his design suppose that support doesn't

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,590
exist when it comes in will probably

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,400
think about it

00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:01,820
I can't think of an API at this point so

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,240
that's how it's gonna be I think small

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,240
stuff

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:14,109
[Music]

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:23,439
get a mess

00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:28,809
okay next I have busting PDR scaling

00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:31,429
that's been going on for now about them

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:34,549
yes hold there will be a separate

00:24:31,429 --> 00:25:36,339
discussion on this topic on Wednesday so

00:24:34,549 --> 00:25:36,339
we can discuss on our summer

00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:52,019
help me I'm just going to give back so

00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:53,850
how close does need RFC to the the

00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:56,600
downstream driver released in chosen

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,600
future alignment

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:12,340
so the question is how this compares to

00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:14,919
the dusk in hyper-v choice yes we don't

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:22,259
support all the types of constraints

00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:22,259
like latency latency

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:34,330
all the bandwidth constraints are all

00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:45,869
Tennessee and there is also a driver

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:50,460
with the apology for a Twinkie so

00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:50,460
currently we have dropped the bindings

00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:13,080
so they have their own driver that they

00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:13,080
want to get upstream eventually

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:26,170
[Music]

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:26,170
yes it's a video here but I am a domain

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,990
okay access topic we have our p.m. clock

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:53,270
control which I think merged that's all

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:55,560
in place it's just not that one

00:27:53,270 --> 00:28:05,430
otherwise everything else is there but

00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:07,410
if you say that you this I can't agree

00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,830
this which I think it also was fine yeah

00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:13,680
that's all good and I have SP my panic

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,900
Carter that's fully up to the sink I

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,460
think internally actually an externally

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,450
they're pretty much the same which is

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,970
pretty impressive

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:24,810
that was like completely used inside the

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,730
company now and the National ever has le

00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,420
GPA

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:33,560
[Music]

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:38,370
I've taken two steps at the LED driver

00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:41,590
and it's succeeding in all bombers

00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,770
remakes in various configurations

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:50,010
[Music]

00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:54,270
if he maintained errs wants me to amend

00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:55,740
to cover we even saw the way because so

00:28:54,270 --> 00:29:02,850
one of the features is that you can

00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:06,330
provide pack terms you can do random

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,190
thing of the brightness as I second

00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,190
iteration I came up with a generic yeah

00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:14,640
led API usage base and user based

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:18,660
interface for poking in a pattern or a

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:23,400
plan pattern that that drivers can

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:26,520
influence and that seemed quite

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:30,000
reasonable and the other part of this

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:33,150
puzzle is there is there's our robot

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,580
called try LED which has three paints

00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:41,880
called red green and blue and you can

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:45,150
configure essentially just a regional

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,160
currency and you turn them on and off in

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,570
the same register say with one register

00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:54,840
right you can talk about three of them

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:58,800
so naturally the LED maintainer

00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:02,940
wants to expose this as a 3 channel RGB

00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:07,290
LED to user space and there is no such

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,710
thing beyond some vague ideas on the

00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,710
Magnus

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,249
so I want to take that path and say that

00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:21,609
those we generate recipients should be

00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:24,259
handled separately or even as a group

00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:27,139
generating with an RGB signal of some

00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:29,599
sort and then daughter of six or

00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:32,749
whatever should expose some completely

00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,460
different eight interface and and then

00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:36,919
you look at for grab the dragon board

00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,099
where those three lines goes to the

00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:43,580
colors green green agreements they are

00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:45,979
three of the four between user LEDs and

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,589
according to nine six four specification

00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:55,269
we're supposed to have a look at

00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:58,940
different traders so in this particular

00:30:55,269 --> 00:31:00,950
in this particular board it's not red

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,669
green and blue line is just three

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:06,679
current sinks and the the fourth usually

00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:09,950
the comes from a separate currency in

00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,659
Venice the Venice then they all four

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,410
looks exactly the same futures Basin

00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:19,900
monitor proposal

00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:23,890
but I requested to expose the muscle RGB

00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:26,380
LED that if there is an RGB LED done for

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:29,530
those lights I have no idea how to do it

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:33,280
to do the DT binding event or how to

00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:36,190
make the code so that as I can in some

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,830
cases interfacing music spaces of which

00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:43,090
I don't think in some cases that's with

00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:46,180
different LEDs and how to do the

00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:48,490
synchronization of something that came

00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:51,180
up earlier which was the seven-segment

00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:54,490
leds which have the same quality like

00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:57,280
you might have a certain bits output

00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,710
that seven separate entities or you

00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,800
could have them as a digit at you

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:05,140
display yes when you have three already

00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,230
have that or is it when you have a bunch

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:13,240
of LEDs that might be configurable

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:15,670
configured in in that cell that would be

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,680
exactly the same case that's depending

00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,960
on which more what project you have are

00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,950
those lights up to you want the

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:28,460
different interface to the user space

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:31,309
and I I was hoping to to be able to

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:33,770
ignore the RGB part for now because that

00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:36,140
would it would both be sufficient for

00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,510
the rival board and it would be on par

00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:42,370
with once they were one important

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:44,929
expense and then that's the second step

00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:54,140
someone else could try to figure out how

00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:57,590
to do their RGB thing I think that all

00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:04,159
the comments on that second revision was

00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:06,169
about well that underneath the binding

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,690
was inside describe each hardwood block

00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,700
is one piece in the DD binding and then

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:15,380
the guy said would it be better to have

00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,990
these this one but there are cases where

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:21,260
all we have is one of these pwm blocks

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:24,440
and nothing more and there are cases

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:27,710
where we have eight of the pw blocks

00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,980
there is a bathroom block and the

00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,710
current sink block so that DT binding be

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,600
able to be able to describe this the

00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:39,890
very agency between there is

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,660
turns out to be quite not so clean is it

00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,710
is it not just changing the compatible

00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:48,260
in a different board

00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:50,570
well what whoa it's just question yes we

00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:59,299
could whether we couldn't coach all this

00:33:50,570 --> 00:34:05,410
in the compatible when I'm punching out

00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:08,570
it's not it doesn't look good and then

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,639
as a side effect of that I have to say

00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:14,480
that they'd 960 version of this where is

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:17,480
just a VW report I would say that that's

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,669
uh we don't be along so maybe that

00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,679
driver should get you into pwm subsystem

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:23,869
and then the other part should give it

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,790
to LEDs subsystem but suddenly we have a

00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:28,429
lot of duplicate code because all the

00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:32,060
math and everything goes into figuring

00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:34,419
out what numbers registers has to be

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,419
over

00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,320
I haven't found a good answer it's but

00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:46,300
it's it's back on my table I started

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,790
looking at that last week together okay

00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:53,179
so we'll see what happens

00:34:48,790 --> 00:35:00,800
all right after this we have clock and

00:34:53,179 --> 00:35:02,900
power of Ananda Rao's fellows so one of

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,010
the things that Apple eventually for

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:09,369
display I don't really know if there's

00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,600
any other cases for this matter is that

00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:15,619
display in particular we need to be able

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,690
to hand over clocks and power remains

00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:22,440
the

00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:24,330
so that we might have this luxury and

00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,970
the Colonel Locke freak out and

00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:37,050
discovers that some blocks are on

00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:41,550
already so I have something to back on

00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:47,090
that for Tennessee I think there was a

00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:47,090
different effort by someone with

00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:54,590
initiatives so in particular that I need

00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,630
to look at our core States to see if

00:35:54,590 --> 00:36:00,560
things are enabled or not because you

00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:03,240
could have the case where you power

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:08,400
device without a monitor plugged in and

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:12,840
it doesn't light up the display so what

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,000
I hacked up was in GDC and the GDS C

00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,790
driver

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,460
and the clock driver it was just a flag

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:23,460
we put on these negative clocks that's a

00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:27,920
paycheck and this is on the driver

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:36,150
Propst and if they stayed off the tree

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:37,170
together I would know one that left

00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,740
college again

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:45,420
so the there's two houses so that's

00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:49,369
that's very happy that's a hot driver

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:52,680
half the GIC does a similar thing and

00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:55,170
then I just exports them both they

00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,450
already exist name underscore o'clock is

00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:01,800
enabled so I could call that from my

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:05,010
driver on the display driver side it

00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,869
starts from the roof of each display

00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:11,520
change so if you think of the display

00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:14,069
train is over latest mixers - encoded in

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,260
HD by over 2 psi or whatever so each of

00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:19,589
the output blocks checks and sees

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:22,770
whether it's you know be signal clock is

00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:24,300
enabled and if it is it work of the

00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:28,140
chain meeting back the state from the

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:35,880
heart alert and basically skips a

00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:38,940
corresponding enable enable understand

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,460
so why he did what would it go to enable

00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,160
it again in 30 well then if you enable

00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,109
it again then you're unable count as one

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,960
too high and when you want to disable it

00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:52,050
the changing solution for example it

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,460
does one but it might be had to add to

00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,680
the continent

00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,660
so you don't have a dolphin bar yes so

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,330
there's there's two cases one is where

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,340
the display driver votes before a user

00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:05,520
space and before the lock tracker

00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:08,790
disables on you squats and the other

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,590
cases or it just loads after so if you

00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:14,610
load after I music law if you want the

00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:16,860
if I FB and and keep working so like

00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,500
when you get to use your space but

00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,570
before your display driver is in kernel

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,620
modules for it you don't cut the clock

00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,620
so you get by oh geez

00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:33,339
or simply yes yes I hope he is a tricky

00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,509
case because there's no

00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:36,509
very good

00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,970
now this is similar to the things we've

00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:45,420
had another drivers before let's talk

00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:51,360
about the teenager I think that's a

00:38:45,420 --> 00:39:02,280
solution focus just yeah I mean on the

00:38:51,360 --> 00:39:05,420
display driver another typical case was

00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,710
funded for the spirit of the pot we're

00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,500
definitely don't want to disable the

00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:23,580
trucks of the console even if you

00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:25,590
haven't it's not quite as thank you so

00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,980
see vendors have rich code to their claw

00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:33,570
drivers just things on what time this

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,740
has to be quite ugly okay this is

00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:39,210
something else because I how this is

00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:40,530
anything I've ever heard for the debug

00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,890
like they're really comfortable and

00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,720
stuff but before your hustle exists

00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,030
maybe keep their box on thank you very

00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,740
the boot council existing forever

00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,240
without the driver provision and they

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,060
just have some hot code for at least

00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,330
like each and anyone I think those

00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,330
original code

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,040
but it sounds like this is basically the

00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:11,260
same problem it's justice you have all

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,880
places at once yeah so I mean as far as

00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,860
the driver needing to know about this

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,540
the divers kinda need to know that it

00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,010
was enabled and brewed up anyways

00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,020
because it needs to read back the state

00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:27,280
who wants to go figure out oh you were

00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:28,960
he color format and it's actually going

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,950
to go try and find the scan how about

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,480
her so we use

00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,670
Hanover the colonel

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,040
so the traditional way to do that would

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,980
be to to have the Blue Note up but the

00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:47,840
state at the device feet yes what I have

00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:50,990
LK as this simple end up returning to my

00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,760
street usually that's used by you

00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,770
booting so I had a distant block the

00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,350
driver and you boot which can use the

00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:03,110
simple FP bindings from LK to give you a

00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:05,330
if I cop so you know but that wouldn't

00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:07,730
have the properties that you want that

00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:09,500
wouldn't have a link to the clocks that

00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:15,740
are already enabled it to the exact fare

00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:17,600
of the part I we get there I guess in

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,030
theory we could get the frame buffer

00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,400
format for now we get the address from

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:24,200
when we kick out the frame buffer

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,630
recipes we don't find there at the

00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,790
chairs we go where the actual frame

00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,620
buffer is and

00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:34,850
the fair enough to perform how we figure

00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:37,160
out just by reading registers and hard

00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:40,340
work like the front end of the pipeline

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:43,730
and that's like one of the easier things

00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:47,240
that is what I rested you to rethink its

00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,260
State Hardware this the harder thing is

00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,500
figuring out the mapping between

00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:55,880
Hardware pipes and mixers and interfaces

00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:02,810
and SNP blockers and he does one set all

00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:05,290
into the by this way to everybody even

00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:09,040
the hardware stay back

00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:11,000
but for the for the reference that

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,350
sounds like something that could be in

00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,090
there because it's not just this one

00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,710
device that you're talking actually

00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:20,330
something that I talked to another

00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:22,520
device yeah I mean from a Linux device a

00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:26,230
point standpoint that'll be like an HDMI

00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,240
or a DSi device plus controller device

00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:31,860
each of those kind of reference a

00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,340
handful of blocks

00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:40,590
there'll be some locks provided by the

00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:45,540
DSi or HDMI which have which are parents

00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:48,140
of stuff that come from GCC or MCC it's

00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,140
kind of a common

00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,660
yeah

00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,160
so this Russia stash to be able to

00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:06,999
not looked at briefly but it looked like

00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:09,099
it was kind of static and I might have

00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:10,839
been misunderstanding I mean I

00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:15,039
definitely wanted to be able to look at

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:17,769
the state of the boot and this is

00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,329
actually a mighty blue blur or not it's

00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:21,189
like I said the blue that Roberto may or

00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:26,619
may not they will display the bank

00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:31,269
whether it's day or night so it has to

00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:35,979
be a Kent it can't be something I guess

00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:38,969
it shows that there's you don't need

00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:38,969
anything about it

00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:51,910
rpm is apparent of this I think we get

00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:54,400
rpm as parents it's summer up in the

00:43:51,910 --> 00:44:06,490
cloud chain and I think we just end up

00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:08,830
getting lucky that it's both those long

00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,300
Sun regulators we don't have a way to

00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:14,200
beat this thing

00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:16,810
yeah I mean the thing is if you only you

00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:21,670
only need to know the leaf node if you

00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:27,550
know that the regulators might fall in

00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:31,920
that category do you ever had Earnhardt

00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,920
read about that is all GPSes there's a

00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:41,140
what about shyness pardon something it'd

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,089
be something like to share cater to the

00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:48,460
piano and uh something he has to see how

00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:52,690
about that perhaps we not 50 just write

00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:56,890
another enable if you call on evolving

00:44:52,690 --> 00:45:00,240
yeah if you just turn it on if you you

00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,240
can tell something else is turned on

00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:09,730
yeah as long as you make that call

00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:13,480
before yeah but the whole thing the

00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:18,790
various things he doing turn things on

00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,260
and off so he got I told this the

00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:23,650
discussion was here was purely about the

00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:28,569
initialization stayed going you you

00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:31,619
don't I don't see what relevance the

00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:34,750
turning off hands to the question I

00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:37,240
think the biggest problem is that the

00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,190
case I think there is one driver probes

00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,990
there really before it's play because

00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,430
the ring that are in attend law yeah but

00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:47,650
the whole point with precious stuff is

00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:51,030
to me the turn offs not happen so you

00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,030
just done checked off before

00:45:52,660 --> 00:46:03,609
you know it's not you we need to stop

00:45:54,819 --> 00:46:08,290
turning stuff off because you can't you

00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:10,630
need to you might have the display in a

00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:14,170
little module or something which could

00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,970
get loaded at any time by user space but

00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:18,369
really all this stuff is custom hunts

00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:19,050
for specific devices anyway so it's

00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:20,400
knowing

00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,200
it's kind of irrelevant that handle it

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,960
properly and the hacks actually work

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:29,640
fine yeah you can't tell when things are

00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,920
gonna get turned off when you could you

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,540
do want to turn things off clearly the

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,730
there's never a moment when it's

00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,730
possible to do that unless you sync with

00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:40,730
user space there's some resistance to

00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:44,300
thinking through the user space for

00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:46,320
reasons that are not super clear to me

00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:58,110
so I'm not sure what precious stuff

00:46:46,320 --> 00:47:00,930
actually does yeah I know I know I just

00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:13,370
over the concrete but concretely was

00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:22,020
proposal is right now some resources

00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:24,540
till the device so just just to make

00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,780
sure that we'll for example the case of

00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:30,500
the regulator pretty stable just take

00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,500
the voltage

00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:44,059
driver

00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:47,160
[Music]

00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:50,849
and that might end up being part of the

00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,280
equation then for like LCD panels on a

00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:55,859
board but what does the entire purpose

00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,500
of it yeah I mean that's that's a case I

00:47:55,859 --> 00:48:01,109
think I mean so far I've been thinking

00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:06,420
more about built-in HDMI or the built-in

00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:08,220
rich chip and DSi HDMI bridge for panels

00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,400
which have their own regulator we might

00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,530
want that in addition to 100 it's not

00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,510
it's also a two angles box as well

00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,119
that's what my big please try to do

00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:20,160
something Apollo's tried Christian

00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:22,770
sailor Paul in crap everybody else a big

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,240
truck push for those regulators specific

00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:29,039
obviously need clocks for all this stuff

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,660
as well so the big thing with ways days

00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,460
it should handle at least regulators and

00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,710
clocks and probably any other resources

00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,359
like you don't want pin control to put

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:40,140
the pins into sleep stay either for

00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:42,630
example yeah yep I mean I guess if they

00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,980
could take a reference without for

00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,720
example a clock we could take a

00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,930
reference to the clock without enabling

00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:51,859
the clock and what

00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:56,740
loads check the clock state to decide

00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:56,740
what to do maybe that could work

00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:07,710
every time we stop talking about styling

00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:10,319
bezel tales okay so next to how that

00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:13,049
that had was a peripheral stuff like USS

00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:19,710
USB piece a you know I think all this is

00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:23,430
fine okay so PCI use there's going

00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:25,140
things walked on no less gender or

00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:29,900
turning out some power that's not

00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,900
exactly the same as whatever attitude

00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,510
[Music]

00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:57,869
dinos blocked on mark tying me that we

00:49:55,319 --> 00:50:05,940
need to support it for not just level

00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:07,380
wedding yeah so there's a whole driver

00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,329
sat down yeah they got stalled

00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:13,440
completely spell because mark guessed

00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:17,670
something about one of them asides not

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:21,390
just level triggered I think special

00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:22,890
history it's saying maybe maybe they

00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,210
could also be level trigger doesn't do

00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,799
the same to us I didn't understand me

00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,680
said that it's ignored I just threw out

00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:31,529
about it was very exciting the top of

00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:34,289
our if he's here he's here yeah no I'll

00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:37,519
pass them over you know we can't resolve

00:50:34,289 --> 00:51:05,269
this but basically is like a

00:50:37,519 --> 00:51:07,489
I think you're going to try pushing that

00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:10,429
simple p.m. bus but not simple peanut

00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:12,709
bus another it being so we have clock

00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:22,459
bus push that one of the art would say

00:51:12,709 --> 00:51:24,979
no so we have the simple bus just group

00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:29,329
devices where the simple pian bus that

00:51:24,979 --> 00:51:34,640
when that associative power remain with

00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:36,829
us the problem is that we have a clocks

00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:43,309
that also needs to be unable at this

00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:45,619
point and they are there's well the way

00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:47,419
this works right now is the way it looks

00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:50,019
is that the power domain should have

00:51:47,419 --> 00:51:51,979
those clocks associated when we just

00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:57,380
enable the power remain that clock

00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:59,089
should be enabled except for Stephens

00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,749
comment that those plots are not related

00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:01,999
to empowerment

00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:04,249
it just happens to leave that they are

00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:07,069
there because what we actually have is

00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:11,239
nested in you that's for bypass mode and

00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:14,299
people figured so so I mean either we

00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:18,919
would describe that simple being bus

00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:23,149
clock thing to do Bocanegra man that bus

00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:26,239
enablement or we will make up dummy s in

00:52:23,149 --> 00:52:29,059
a new device to represent what's

00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,840
actually there in hard work but linens

00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:32,600
would never see

00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:34,850
so could you have another power domain

00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,800
that just inherits from the real

00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:38,720
Parliament and from the two trucks and

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,910
that would be a very simple power main

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,320
drivers regular power so the problem is

00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,360
of that the problem is that the power

00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:48,740
remain or the maintainer who would take

00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:51,050
that whoever spot this responsible for

00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:53,300
the driver for this part of me says

00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:55,490
these clocks does not relate to this

00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,800
Parliament therefore I don't want to add

00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:01,790
these clocks to the listener box for

00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:09,550
this power main because they the clocks

00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:12,440
are complete unrelated so there is a

00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:16,130
there's a power man and there is an SMU

00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:18,470
and the cloths for this enemy you are

00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,990
not directly related to the power man

00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:22,610
so what we normally would do is we would

00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,110
do a night when you attacks or whatever

00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:26,000
that would turn all those clocks

00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:29,540
except we don't have an item of you

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,850
because letters doesn't see that so so I

00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,740
know would make up it couldn't be a true

00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:41,630
that means it doesn't there's many

00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:43,070
translations actually an IMU driver

00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:47,330
there which you couldn't describe in the

00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:49,220
DT yeah exactly

00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:51,380
yes do you give in to my street it's

00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,210
described exactly what the hardware is

00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,430
yeah which are then I was there were

00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:57,200
meetups people and I have a new brother

00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:59,570
doesn't do nothing think that they have

00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,710
a new mayor can do this that new

00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:05,180
subsystem could handle this couldn't

00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:07,270
handle item use that don't do any

00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:11,749
dynamic translation

00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:11,749
[Music]

00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,969
[Music]

00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,239
[Music]

00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:42,340
[Music]

00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:01,090
[Music]

00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,079
[Music]

00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:37,700
well it sounds like we need to make a

00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:37,700
whole nother silicium IOM to PCI devices

00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,489
[Music]

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:50,010
must certainly do one full eye on you

00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:52,500
because you have a lot of PCI devices

00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:55,200
that about their limit referring to

00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:59,100
DNA but they do want to address high

00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,860
memory so if there's a hot girl whom you

00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:03,720
they're real and the only thing that's

00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:08,220
on it is the PCI bus you really really

00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,750
want a proper home you drive apart but

00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:14,430
the firmer we have we'll never use it

00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:19,230
though and whatever be unlocked care

00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:20,760
about it firmware it's sandbox and be

00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:25,470
safe in every space from the rest of the

00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:29,490
system and now that's a device in order

00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:31,070
to control that sandbox and the problem

00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:34,170
with removing the simple peeing bus

00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:36,180
think that all the PCI devices already

00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:38,190
have a part of me or they have their

00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:41,280
individual Parliament's if I still need

00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:47,270
to represent their over there the shine

00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:50,340
allowance that she gives yes pardon me

00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:51,800
or we need to 29 out of you and then the

00:56:50,340 --> 00:57:05,180
diamond view is turned on when it's

00:56:51,800 --> 00:57:10,620
attached as my mind let's just push both

00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:14,790
money anyway usually the situation is

00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:16,320
within among you where the OS is not an

00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,300
appropriate role of The Hobbit The

00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:22,790
Avenues programs through the film when

00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,790
it detonates of some sort but uh

00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:34,490
you could use it to them mmm you drive

00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:37,670
that just the problem then how do you

00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:40,580
use all PCI device in order to GPC

00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:42,620
anybody to do so the other support

00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:50,720
Conklin CI devices that have been

00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:52,700
qualified for this I mean does this like

00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,070
they've ever made family the complete

00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:58,100
piece a limitation that was three

00:57:55,070 --> 00:58:03,140
devices but all those pipelines things

00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:06,440
as well yeah I don't know what was going

00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:09,950
around that no or one minute passes so

00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,480
we had no I think this piece a thing no

00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:13,910
one's in everything believes with this

00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:16,070
existing hardware we have right we're

00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:17,900
not going to change anybody used these

00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:20,420
guy I don't know how doesn't work

00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,990
Serena doing either we use for Ethernet

00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,990
and Wi-Fi

00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:30,140
maybe nothing supposed to be static

00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:35,500
besides I hate at all if justice ended

00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:35,500
up in phone with devices

00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:43,010
yes let them all go down to is how you

00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:51,180
control these crops

00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:53,040
president Park said so we have a custom

00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:59,850
driverless parenting that one so that we

00:58:53,040 --> 00:59:03,710
get the pure mountain parks we have sort

00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:03,710
of two dummy parents just you

00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:16,600
and I thought next another fight night

00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:40,300
driver which doesn't impede buses she

00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:41,500
say which is one light more than I think

00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,540
we're done unless you watch the ground

00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,800
talk more good that's it

00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:56,260
I had a lot of our topics for the new

00:59:44,800 --> 01:00:05,130
dagger display video if you want

00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:05,130
something else fun the appointment

01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,679
