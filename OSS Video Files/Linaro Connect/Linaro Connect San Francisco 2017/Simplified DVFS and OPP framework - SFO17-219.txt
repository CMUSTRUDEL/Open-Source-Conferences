Session Name: Simplified DVFS and OPP framework - SFO17-219
Speaker: Viresh Kumar
Track: Power Management


★ Session Summary ★
During the 4.6 development cycle, the operating performance points (OPP) framework gained the infrastructure to do dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) on behalf of device drivers. This helps in reducing the complexity of those drivers, which can instead focus on platform-specific details. The rest of this article discusses what has changed and how can we use it to simplify our device drivers.
