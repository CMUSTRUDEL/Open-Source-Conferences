	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,060
[Music]

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,320
[Music]

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:36,110
okay morning everyone I'm Jenny from

00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:38,180
hello today I would have this session

00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:45,640
and I have to define it it so how it

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:49,750
goes identified first and we and

00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,750
otherwise we can't talk about it

00:00:52,239 --> 00:01:00,440
so the nation will be divided into they

00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,960
need to be passed so first of all I will

00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,409
give some brief instructions for

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:13,220
different and secondary I will talk

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:17,570
about the study at home let's talk about

00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:21,789
the boss and math let's have a

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,789
discussion on depth charge

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:44,160
okay so I think people are being very a

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:48,250
very hot topic recently with the Fiji

00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:51,790
automotive robots don't best praise

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:55,590
every major elements for dignity

00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:59,860
the first one is advanced noodle

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,800
network-related borders we can hold the

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:08,350
convolutional network different network

00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:15,220
and long shots of memory support

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:17,620
they also stamp our derivative with

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,930
unholy within based convolutional net

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:26,709
work they are also a lot as models

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:32,310
developed in the last year yes we not

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:35,160
all except the vug and Google Nexus from

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:42,190
image recognition allies still

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:45,519
competition for the second element if

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:49,120
you learn what all four can be looking

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:53,049
platforms right so I think we see the

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,120
major topic for my second day when we

00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:59,230
can have a more effective measure all

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:03,700
this time grandpa taught the third one

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:07,660
is a large excess availability so there

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:10,420
are a lot of content available for

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:14,019
training of dignity for example the

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:19,180
image net for unity our mission is far

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:22,870
hence there are 100 origins for all

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:27,880
these are all activity net for behavior

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:31,890
an explanation okay so these after me

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,890
make basic elements

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,770
so for this lady they are mainly two

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,490
stages training and inference so the tip

00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:48,100
knowledge meaning in may need an

00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:51,790
all-volunteer sense I because I need

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,160
very powerful computing capability

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,990
otherwise the meaning will last a very

00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,700
long time to complete so this is in

00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:06,180
planning framework can be selected

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:13,480
apology any income side so to generate

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:20,380
trend model from the data sector to get

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:23,850
that waste water while the inference can

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:28,090
be done either on cloud tech center or

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,780
any devices so for the inference on edge

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,280
devices

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,560
I think the pre-trained models can be

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,860
loaded to do the immediate the deck

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:43,320
prediction with low maintenance privacy

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:46,660
I think sometimes should have more

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,669
different support or end devices I see

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,120
it visited up with opportunity for our

00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,120
path loss

00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:02,540
okay so then let's have a look at the

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:08,980
platform times to support eternity

00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:13,040
so here the diagram trying to describe

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,860
thought so what about support but we are

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,080
different cut of accelerators which can

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,300
be used to accelerate disability

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,790
operations and the drivers choose a

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:30,590
target by including the Colorado driver

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:33,140
taking the space long time then on top

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:39,050
of that there are some low-level

00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:43,750
libraries for deepening operations

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:46,430
without hope the basic linear algebra

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:51,590
library twice so for the 4-h has

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:53,950
formation support and usually hardware

00:05:51,590 --> 00:06:00,940
vendors would have their own version of

00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:04,580
the low-level not with your own

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:11,150
optimization foundation and there are

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:12,919
some popular exchange support units

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:18,050
available and we'll click on folder and

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,210
very Akula right under for young focus

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,000
your horse

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,789
so moving on so we are lost as heat

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,200
learning frameworks give you the wallet

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:34,150
now so I just it is this is aa lot of

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:37,700
popular one here right we learn called

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:45,010
the temporal from Google thank you from

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:45,010
Facebook alright next match Todd and the

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:52,970
and moving opportunity based on these

00:06:49,660 --> 00:07:00,610
trademarks application can be developed

00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:02,660
for different areas so I think from

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,479
college and because there are a lot of

00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:09,639
friend afraid for a lobster pot now we

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:15,310
had some kind of friendly recommendation

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:18,110
so with apple and sweet apples for

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,260
application America Holly can switch

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,300
between different frameworks all College

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,060
can make Leah application quality across

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,449
different breadbox right to use

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:34,729
different models and for each spring

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:38,660
what how they can use different exam

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:44,199
eaters right so they're not a problem

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:47,240
here happy and hope we can adjust them

00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,030
in the future and I think the bigger

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,320
player in this area has already realized

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:58,460
some problems for for this ecosystem and

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:05,790
as a solution to some of them I think

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:09,510
they're to some party with include okay

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:13,870
so I summarized some have linear

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:16,630
accelerators here so GT you FPGA basic

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:21,090
ESP and as I understand there are some

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,090
others for example said you know morphic

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,010
for cheek you are I think immediate

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:34,570
dominating the market now they have very

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:37,240
good for the portfolio for cleanup will

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,240
they decide extent i they have very food

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,630
that has not fallen products and the for

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,840
automotive they have a giant PS platform

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:51,160
and they also have some embedded

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:59,320
products for continuing right supports

00:08:51,160 --> 00:09:02,890
and AMD is also promoting some machining

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:06,160
product called Iranian music they also

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,920
established some preparation by to I

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,320
from China

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,130
14:13 optimizations so then if they are

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,130
trying to catch on

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:25,630
they are also some robotic use in both

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:29,680
the user on products by ahmadi called

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:32,100
college you know religion or VR vs. the

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,100
bounty

00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:38,600
homogeneous and because the mobility

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:43,610
remaining for in first I thought it was

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,920
useful for training so what is it a

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,670
fantastically was water in a Google

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,639
interview there's a first terrorism TQ

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,920
Kennedy the polling place the CM a

00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,970
Google number to YouTube which can also

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:02,059
be used for training support internal

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:06,879
support the burner for some basic

00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:10,819
support in this area Amelia has do AE

00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:14,209
which is mainly used for automotive now

00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:16,850
for driving here to the ER aging

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:27,069
integrators and any possible recently

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:31,660
also this goe so players in China in

00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:36,799
Oregon robotics and the camera can with

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:40,579
basic for determining the chemical and

00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:44,350
you also buy in created by the ladies

00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,350
given 970

00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:54,350
okay so all PPG attack I think there are

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,220
two big players in the market share of

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,119
Alicia

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:04,399
nada info they have a static window

00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:11,779
cyclone service VGA studies they can

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:15,399
still ask you the other lighting space

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:20,989
products in China we can for the debut

00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:24,220
EP from eg Jack Benny we also working on

00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:24,220
some body to face

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:31,300
a product called XP use oh yeah

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:35,630
the a lot happy you now Tajima markets

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:39,290
so and for a divisive and DST can also

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:41,269
be elaborate but yeah a lot of also

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,329
there are several internet nation in the

00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,910
monkeys so we come for Hong Kong Hextall

00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:50,449
we should also define a little by the

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:53,740
annual kinetic energy so there's also

00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:57,199
some products from mastema

00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:03,259
excellent area and some products from

00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:05,019
SGI okay so and there the moon has been

00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:08,839
as there are a lot of options for

00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:12,170
acceleration but you can average 40

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,410
clean but how we change this is a big

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,410
power

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,209
okay so let's have a look at some I use

00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:26,069
based analyzer place auditor I think it

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,079
is the most popular way a little cooler

00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:36,350
buy it because they are not products now

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:39,420
in market but cool propriety here and

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:44,810
you can maybe use a little products

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,810
other vendors cannot do it

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,769
solar energy with heterogeneous compute

00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:55,730
in the face of village

00:12:51,769 --> 00:13:00,209
so this keep didn't actually some a very

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:05,089
similar to support growth and we have

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:11,430
the piña colada and Albania and we

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:14,279
compile to make make supporting them

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,579
good application to him and the platform

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,579
easy

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,759
yeah also several standard standard

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,829
point in space certified by the Romans

00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:30,149
organization when the Hortensio

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:35,160
kids are open computing language so Appa

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:40,529
Co cancel all not anime if you buy also

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:42,930
FPGA DLP and other accelerators and over

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,180
DX of amazing millions of image

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,060
processing and up to the beach and a

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:52,410
very also some a specific extension for

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:55,110
our needle network and another one in

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:58,920
Vulcan so far can design for both

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:05,160
graphics and compute but it is mainly

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:07,019
used for graphics now as far as I can

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:13,529
say so

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:21,589
I think I'm not sure the plan for

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:25,610
computer support with Vulcan so this is

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:29,309
some our main interface yes there are

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:32,540
libraries equality to use these

00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:37,439
interfaces with them familiar to have a

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:41,839
good idea and library who the class

00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:45,269
could have passed using a college class

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:49,199
and he also has a very reliable risk

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:52,730
with just using via enthusiast and

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,470
underline Locrian platform and they have

00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:02,189
my open machine machine intelligence

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:03,110
open library for optimization long only

00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:07,019
energy panels

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:12,059
so over here we are also some libraries

00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:16,980
we namco uncompleted rivalry has autopsy

00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:19,889
report to also departed on some ability

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,860
expenses for them no meaningful work to

00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:24,870
design a course this is also enabled by

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,990
the College in Oakland co2 from the air

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,800
but it is needed for some open sea at

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:35,129
one point one or one point to

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:38,339
implementation and the column also had

00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:41,939
other the new low processing engine the

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:47,040
legal protection engine can use all the

00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:52,379
processes platform between CPU GPU DSP

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:55,600
so 42 parts of the Sierra confused so we

00:15:52,379 --> 00:16:00,070
are out there also some other libraries

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,630
like aging which is a C++ template

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:09,040
library for living algebra open glass

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:12,550
new network tag etcetera so very also

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:18,790
some popular libraries in angle of a CD

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:22,470
obvious computer vision library and go

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:25,000
open see also nasty 1tn and more

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:29,340
specifically for plenty

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,700
so analytics as a smaller is based on

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:38,740
highly in media traffic education

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:43,530
so yes also we can talk more about the

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:47,290
high up in the media in every page later

00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:51,690
so and from other vendors finding hope

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:58,450
from guidance site they say have young

00:16:51,690 --> 00:17:00,610
the deal 11g aromatic ways yeah yeah

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,750
tickle anonymous from alligators so I

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:13,020
cannot list all the vehicle they are not

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:13,020
imitation the Endo's okay so

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:25,240
the brakes so I will cha cha cha try to

00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:29,770
be very careful we can see that who I

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:34,060
supported by horrible side here and

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:39,580
support others to support our hip and

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:50,540
for the CEO and Asia has some other to

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:54,380
expand i-70 also I have a cockatoo so so

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:57,650
for the best part acting because there

00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,740
are some good in straight community

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:06,070
freedom hope that all called black

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,070
dollar SDKs for actually happens this is

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,000
good infrastructure to automate

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,240
benchmarking optimization designer 40 20

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,260
SEC to set quite different plants and it

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,350
has the finest a unified Jason he tries

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:29,060
to extract access to change software and

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:32,960
hardware and thank you also oversaw

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,670
facility bench best map to get stocks on

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:41,330
a basically an operation in different

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:43,430
hallways of what is any okay so let's

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,790
have a look at the camera challenges

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:52,670
first I will talk about architecture

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:58,310
agnostic issues so we can see a vendor

00:18:52,670 --> 00:19:01,929
specific API for miniatures I put out

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:08,590
and keep palpable TQ they have the

00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:18,299
I think what we make such into text and

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:21,220
background we should have especially for

00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:25,509
application developer firm of the verify

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:29,470
so okay so I'm not quite sure is

00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:34,899
obviously I can't take this I cannot see

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:39,399
some other option here the problem here

00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:41,619
that focuses upon it limits the sofa by

00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:45,759
the inflating frameworks back to the

00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:48,759
situation is changing media with some

00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:53,950
architectural changes in the popular

00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:58,929
frameworks so obviously all support and

00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:01,600
there is no issue in a moment by default

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:06,399
for almost all the major credit reports

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,379
and the is Piazza are the first project

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:18,100
to run through the whole procedure

00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:23,919
called a colander so here so the CUDA

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:27,369
kernel can be compiled to some are in

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,740
the media and by encode rock so for the

00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:33,730
host of code that can't be translated to

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:37,379
a halt bytecode and for the whoever that

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:42,700
can be translated to device a bytecode

00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:47,139
and in comparison vampire clan so at one

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:52,389
time the device five code in translated

00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:55,840
to OpenGL photo and it couldn't call are

00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:58,490
translated at you OpenGL calls again

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,120
state the previous

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:07,460
correct implementation and long on

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:10,700
platforms with a Laodicea not yet clear

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,390
about this Crandall divine thank you

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,820
Pastor

00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:22,010
if you have interests to have a look at

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:26,380
it so another variation the

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:38,390
fragmentation of deep learning robots

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:41,420
yeah so Anna voice each framework it is

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:45,260
not easier to add unit generates some

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:48,010
pot and if you add the texture of

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:51,380
accelerate support for one for a walk

00:21:48,010 --> 00:22:02,870
after you switch to another for you need

00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:05,920
a so so some are unified computation

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:08,240
abroad immediate representation and

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,390
against immediate elected the

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:18,470
invitations thought can't properly each

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:22,100
capsule to unify the implementation well

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:27,200
I would I was talking about it as a

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:29,600
media representation and all different

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,230
depending where most guys look good in

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,750
top right page so community community or

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:39,140
limited there are some problems finding

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:44,300
hope to share operator and a cancer

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:47,290
between different frameworks so that

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,810
there's a deep learning happen although

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:54,170
on discussion which is which will be

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:57,500
adopted by and it's net I taught a to

00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:01,740
the tiny tiny diamond

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:04,410
and it also has a model translate model

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:08,130
translation required to support the

00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:12,809
ability to self-heal for a box with

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,100
regard to applications you will we need

00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:19,080
to start our unified API for

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:21,900
productivity so Kara study Tyson deep

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:26,940
lending library supporting against low

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:29,309
dmg cake still anime a mix mix it not so

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,549
you can just you this Harris library and

00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:35,790
then configure it to you use different

00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:39,660
implant exact lock for Google say

00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:42,480
announced can provide at this year and

00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:52,500
then they have their legal network API

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:57,410
pine from announcement during 9:30 from

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,410
hydrogen the demo natural age cited used

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:06,030
so yeah there are some implementations

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,400
of the media interactive detonation so

00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,980
we now call the Google a CoA which is a

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,340
domestic product to support different

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:20,400
back ends with as you can edit the back

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:24,150
end here so I think the major focus from

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,730
Google is to make it easier to add a new

00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:30,120
device support without hooks it they

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,490
want to get to keep you support

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,510
previously didn't difficult to support

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:41,059
to you but with this x-ray of course the

00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:45,450
heart of Italian distracted for UK media

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:49,860
so and other frameworks that have a

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:52,500
similar presentation so but we do need a

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:56,990
unified way for all the frameworks

00:24:52,500 --> 00:25:00,630
instead of each framework have one extra

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:06,320
implementation but they use so it is

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:10,410
some kind of new fragmentation in - a so

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:13,830
so I'm a wondering who will become the

00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:17,190
am/pm body turning right because what we

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:20,640
are at the end we have a lot from end by

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:26,490
an inch and also a lot of back-end for

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:31,650
acceleration so this is a I think this

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:38,309
is a goal we should like to try to

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:40,860
achieve okay so let's talk about some

00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:43,980
specific targeted here

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:46,650
so for deep learning training so we

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:50,809
called as a major implementation

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:55,590
solution based on g TQ right but for

00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:59,280
untied yeah so them on board we go to pc

00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:01,679
I'm afraid it called freedom for AMD GPU

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,309
only lock em implementation but it

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,110
letting acquired his giant gentry with

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:10,100
this giant mixer halt

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:14,429
some high-end FPGA card also required

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:16,650
PCI gen3 or chain 4 and all our

00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:19,500
platforms the discrete graphics dragon

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:21,450
important as winning a million called

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,140
private island in support they are on

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,929
solitude

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:30,240
there's no 64-bit support and European

00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:36,419
support lady in Phoenix but no generally

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:38,460
on support and so I'm rolling and at

00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,380
this moment the binary of the co-drivers

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:46,410
for mobile GPUs cannot be achieved

00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:49,169
easily for example for the 96 ports we

00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,750
cannot find that obviously of John

00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:54,150
easily so I said this is one area we can

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:58,110
improve looking forward with our

00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:01,799
partners so on we can also do some

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:04,950
optimization of for held devices we now

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:08,970
holds a memory for optimization google

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:11,910
is doing something in this area to make

00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:14,250
can control what better on mobile

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:17,309
devices we can call a calm conversation

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:20,460
and the no messaging in for example

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:22,410
previously the floating point is used

00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,919
for the difference and now they are

00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:31,710
trying to use some internet support for

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:33,360
the interest so that can be used and the

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,220
way we talk because and the probably

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,290
very important on many devices but we

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:44,580
also needed to check about poly facility

00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:49,770
we different activity solutions so I

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:53,580
listed here and some obviously of

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:56,040
support for 96 boss and luckily I cannot

00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,720
find all the Visio drivers for the

00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:05,580
platform and I followed went to Alabama

00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:09,630
1996 and we need to also do a thing

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:13,200
called testing all about 1996 and

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:17,159
invested it has all the top 30 with nine

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:22,039
emotional length so we can see that the

00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:24,450
performance can be we can have good

00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:30,139
quality cue acceleration for

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:30,139
convolutional net work both very huge

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,190
improvement

00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:42,080
okay so yeah so hope we can still have

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,080
that reminisce to answer Patrick

00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:53,789
oh you're talking about the use of GPUs

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:57,190
and dedicated Asics this is the move

00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:59,499
dedication hard work deeply noticeable

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,999
or is there ever times would be able to

00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:03,519
move back to use in general processes

00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:07,599
with things like the central vector

00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:10,570
extensions yeah I think the bond area to

00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,909
the accelerator rocks for example if you

00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,049
have better floating point support and

00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:18,509
they give more general prime and it has

00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:23,889
more capability for parallel computing

00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:27,489
and so a PGA have very good advantage

00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:30,940
for Halloween or any ability right so

00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:34,239
and I know there will be some DJ makes

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:37,899
96 boss which I think which will be very

00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:38,619
beautiful the work in this area go in

00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:43,779
for HD

00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:51,029
I think the Asian part and yeah will be

00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:56,229
also eating it for you and a device ID

00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:59,379
with a medium Toa and then there are

00:29:56,229 --> 00:30:02,759
some other products which can also be

00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:06,099
used and devices but we can work with

00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:08,739
educators to create some more so than

00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:13,979
the community change them upon

00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:13,979
graduation and all for making products

00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:22,859
oh okay so steady a moustache if you

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,429
have other questions you can me

00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:25,429
