	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
prai's when we get to that okay well I'm

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,809
really glad to be here today this is

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,880
actually a treat for me as well because

00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,049
I've in addition to my my career at

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,360
Qualcomm I've been at Qualcomm a long

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,760
time since 1991 working on wireless and

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,460
cellular I've also an experimenter and I

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,380
love to work with Linux and I've used

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,630
the various boards and community boards

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,930
and been part of that too so that'll

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:32,579
weave that into some of the some of the

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:35,340
talk here first just kind of a little

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:40,590
look back at them at the mobile industry

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,030
and the way we think of it is mobile the

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,440
moderate version of what we call mobile

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,170
business or mobile technology kind of

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,440
started about 30 years ago when we had

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,780
analog cellular when you know cell

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,850
phones and portable wireless battery

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,640
powered devices started to be very

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,859
popular and reached large volumes used

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,140
by consumers kind of changing your life

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,229
the ability to communicate and the focus

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,479
for many years was connecting people so

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,250
you could talk to someone you could you

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,020
could send a text message to someone you

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,670
could send email to someone and then

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,010
later it got to be sharing pictures and

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,720
videos but it was connecting people that

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,909
was like a big thing that's what the

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,500
operators were you know offering

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,210
packages that you would buy so you could

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,229
talk to people and that was the main

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,159
thrust of it going forward from now on

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:28,080
we're going to be connecting their

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,729
worlds we're going to be connecting you

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,220
we're not just going to be talking or

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,380
texting we're gonna be sharing

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,030
experiences immersive experiences that

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,450
are real-time that are very rich that

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,390
are video audio sensors data augmented

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,430
reality those types of things on a

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,159
massive scale between people between

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,350
things machines so we're basically going

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,920
from connecting people to connecting

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,509
everything so keep that theme in mind

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,060
another theme that's really happening a

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,520
lot is devices and machines are becoming

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,899
much more intelligent and we'll talk a

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,880
little bit about machine learning how we

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,950
define that how we think of it what the

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,229
impact is that's going to be obviously

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,599
there's enormous interest in almost all

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,760
fields now about this topic we're really

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,950
seeing it in the mobile business where

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,260
we're placing intelligence and all

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,459
devices in new ways and I'm going to

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,769
talk a little bit about a very

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,110
interesting point of this which is where

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,550
the processing is done where is it done

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,989
in the device is it then in the cloud

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,819
there's pros and cons to both of those

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:33,900
and we want to be able to support them

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:35,250
in kind of some interesting ways the as

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,370
I mentioned that I've always enjoyed

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,610
being an experimenter and the the dragon

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,590
board development kits the 410 C and and

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,840
and the I'll mention a little bit about

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,450
the newer ones coming out have really

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,880
been a great project for us and we've

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:55,099
worked with with Lonardo with 96 boards

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,099
and I think I have a picture of it here

00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,670
it's it's so exciting all the progress

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,230
that's been made when we first announced

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,730
this board I was like I got to get one

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,970
of these I want to get it as soon as I

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,380
can get it and I got the board and

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,630
because I've been using Raspberry Pi for

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,340
a couple of things yeah which was great

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:16,019
actually I like that product a lot have

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,730
a bunch of them I wanted to use this and

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,560
I first turned it on I had some problem

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,880
and a whole bunch of people at Qualcomm

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,980
said oh I can help you I can help you I

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,709
can help you and I said you know thank

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,590
you but I want to try and do it to the

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,720
external resources the forum the ninety

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,819
six boards Lennar Oh get the code and

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,389
see if I can if I can bring up the board

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:39,690
even if if I'm not a you know don't have

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,910
direct access to the developer and the

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,769
first time it was hard there was code

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,620
you had to combine and some things

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,930
didn't work quite right but cheese it's

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,400
gotten so much better and now it's just

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,280
a piece of cake and you can it's so

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,870
exciting you can just order these boards

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,239
from Aero and others there's all kinds

00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,329
of mezzanine boards for cameras and

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,190
audio and other things so it's just been

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,500
really exciting now the 410 C is a

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,720
pretty powerful processor but it's not

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,590
really on par with what the state of the

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,919
art is and so oh I'm going to mention

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,530
this too it's finding its way into some

00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,139
really great use cases and this is a

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,380
picture of a first robot from the FIRST

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,970
Robotics Competition maybe you're

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,070
familiar with it started by Dean came in

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,660
20-some years ago very popular around

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,460
the world there's thousands of T

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,850
seems hundreds of thousands of students

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,430
and they are now making use of this

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,740
board for the for the first global robot

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,410
and we're real real happy about that so

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,440
it's having a real positive impact for

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,440
kids and stammen and education purpose

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,170
but we're looking ahead to the next

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,820
generation now this isn't a place where

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,320
I can we can actually make the official

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,270
formal watch and I think some of you

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,490
know about this anyway but we are coming

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,720
out with a follow-on to the 410 see the

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,700
820 C C is for community and that's a

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,910
very very powerful chip so we're very

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,730
excited about that it's really the same

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:15,450
processor that you find in modern you

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:18,360
know fairly recent high-end smartphones

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,630
like the galaxy and the LG and the HTC's

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,290
those kinds of devices it's got a lot of

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,420
capability a lot of devices on the on

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,270
the chip in addition to the CPU the GPU

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,220
the DSP and and there's all kinds of

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,130
connectivity subsystem and there's a lot

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,280
of capability with that so oh and as an

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,680
example the same core the we have

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,690
another version called the 820 a for a

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,580
as for automotive that we're going to be

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,440
using for automotive applications so

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,990
that's just a an indicator that it's a

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,460
very high-performance part that we're

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,680
using for many things ok let's talk a

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,669
little bit about machine learning and

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,430
and how that how that fits in with this

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,780
this is a quote from from IDC I found it

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,520
a little surprising actually but I think

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,940
the the main thrust of it is actually

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,360
correct that in the past most software

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,620
developers are most instances are not

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,230
incorporating what we call cognitive

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,330
capabilities into their applications and

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,880
then that it's expected to dramatically

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,440
grow now whether it goes from 1% for 50

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,210
percent in one year or a few more months

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,490
I don't know but I think the general

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,090
thrust of this is exactly right and I'll

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,790
define specifically what we mean by this

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:35,640
so what is what is AI

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:39,300
it's these these are some quotes that

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,280
that I got from taking Andrew ings

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,790
course if you haven't heard about that

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,640
on

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:49,260
Coursera it's absolutely excellent and I

00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,580
did that myself recently field of study

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,750
that gives computers the ability to

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,910
learn without being explicitly

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,470
programmed or kind of more precisely a

00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:01,740
program that learns from experience II

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:05,700
with respect to some class of tasks T

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,000
and performance measure P and the deal

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,740
is if the performance on the task T

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,170
improves with experience it measurably

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,610
then we call that machine learning it's

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,720
not like someone changed the code or

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,600
changed the algorithm they simply

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,730
provided it with more data and ran the

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,250
machine more times and given that it

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,500
improved its performance measurably then

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,500
we consider that in the class of machine

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,720
learning or artificial intelligence and

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,150
that is what's really really really hot

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,960
right now and there are so many use

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:39,450
cases so computer vision and I'll show

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,090
you a video of that that we're using for

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:46,020
automotive I saw a demonstration

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:49,980
yesterday at Qualcomm of the ability of

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,690
a phone to recognize an animal not just

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,910
an animal but at whether it was a dog or

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:58,110
cat but not just that but what kind of

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,790
what species of dog it was and they did

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,460
eat all of that processing all that

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,830
inference on the device so it can give

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,500
you a very fast answer and also be very

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,600
private about what you've pointed it at

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,100
it doesn't have to leave the device so

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,470
that's computer vision that's kind of a

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,440
traditional application of this language

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,960
you know translation and and speech to

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,560
text and so forth cybersecurity to

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,600
detect not just a scan of the memory to

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,510
find the signature of a piece of malware

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,760
but actually detect by observing the

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,770
behavior of a device that it's behaving

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,620
in a strange way compared to the norm

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,110
and flag that autonomous vehicles

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,380
robotics of course huge applications

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:44,520
there performance optimization an

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,130
example of that is inside our flagship

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,290
products the the issues of power

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,360
management for example are very complex

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,340
there's lots of subsystems you want them

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,970
to go to sleep as much as possible but

00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,459
you don't want them to

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,230
to not be available when when they when

00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:01,750
they're needed so there's a very complex

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,550
power management in the past that's kind

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,370
of a heuristic algorithm with a bunch of

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,110
conditionals now we can train it with

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,560
machine learning and get much better

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,819
performance data management of course so

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,879
that's just an example of the

00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:18,069
ever-increasing use cases in fact it's

00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,949
displacing traditional signal processing

00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:24,339
in many instances now and then modem

00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:27,339
design and equalizers and receivers so

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:30,759
it's just it's just an amazing thing now

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:32,560
let's talk a little bit about on the

00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,110
device intelligence and we're processing

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,990
is done and where this machine learning

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,259
and other types of things are done there

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:44,170
are key benefits to doing processing on

00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,910
the device it can if you do it on a

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,980
device that you can be much more

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,319
efficient in your use of connectivity

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,389
and bandwidth it can potentially be more

00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:53,439
reliable if you're inside the you know

00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:55,540
if you're in an area where your

00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:57,189
connections coming and going there can

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,050
be more secure more private to you and

00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:01,509
low latency now we're going to talk

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,009
about that because with 5g we're going

00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:04,720
to lower the latency so that's going to

00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,309
move the boundaries of some of these

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,740
things this is just a

00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:11,559
back-of-the-envelope example in this

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,410
example you've got a an application

00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:16,600
where you want to you want to know how

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,129
many seats are on a bus how many empty

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,329
seats there are so maybe you have some

00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:21,399
kind of app and when the bus is coming

00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:22,779
up you you know if it's full or empty or

00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,939
if you're the fleet operator you can

00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,309
kind of track that so how are you gonna

00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:29,649
do that well one way is to put a camera

00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:31,839
in the bus that looks at all the seats

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,059
okay it's gonna take a picture every few

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,370
seconds it's going to run some algorithm

00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:37,689
and it's going to tell you the answer

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,610
now where are you going to do that are

00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:43,059
you gonna do that algorithm on the on

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:46,059
the bus or in the cloud if you do it in

00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,800
the cloud then the processing on the bus

00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:49,480
is very simple it's just a camera it

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,639
sends pictures but now you've got to

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,069
send the pictures over the radio every

00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,199
few seconds you know night and day for

00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,449
hours and hours on end and you incur a

00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:00,639
cost of bandwidth and you can multiply

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,069
that out based on some data plan and it

00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,399
can be 420 bus fleet that can be very

00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:08,450
expensive per day if instead you can put

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,330
that processing on the on the

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,160
and it can do the computer vision and

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,320
recognize the number of seats that are

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,000
occupied then instead of setting like

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,280
raw video frames back I can send the

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,800
answer back and you can you can save a

00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,830
huge amount of cost so that's an example

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,400
of why it can be very powerful and

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:32,090
beneficial to put processing in the

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,550
device now I should say there are

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,770
instances or the other way is also

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,930
advantage to those are instances where

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,320
you want to have extreme processing that

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,820
goes beyond what you can fit and in that

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,710
case you want to have a low latency a

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:51,220
link like a five gene we'll talk about

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:54,320
that in a minute okay - to facilitate

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,540
what I've just described to you we've

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,570
introduced something that we call the

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,650
Snapdragon neural processing engine

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,790
internally we know it as snappy but

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:07,880
externally it's the SNP II and it allows

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,560
it's a framework that allows these type

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,860
of networks to be run really efficiently

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,710
on the Snapdragon and underneath it it

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,050
can make use of the CPU the GPU or the

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:22,880
DSP depending on you know which is

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,800
optimal for that network okay I'm going

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,620
to give you an example you're gonna see

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,780
a video here and this video is not a

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,030
simulation I mean it's running it's a

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,910
video that that ran on an actual

00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:37,040
Snapdragon device so it's think of it as

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,110
something that ran in real time on a

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,270
mobile it wasn't done offline or

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:45,110
anything like that and it's it's going

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:47,690
to categorize what it sees in terms of

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:53,090
pedestrian tree building roads sidewalk

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:57,200
and it looks like this and this is this

00:12:53,090 --> 00:13:00,680
is an example of categorization and it

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,880
can lead to as an input into an

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,460
algorithm that's going to do autonomous

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,920
driving here in this case it's putting

00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,140
bounding boxes around objects and

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,980
categorizing them as pedestrian or

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:18,440
vehicle and that all runs on the on the

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:22,070
device okay and then there's

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,010
the next one this is what I'm personally

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,170
very excited about is you're gonna see

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,930
another application of this for drones

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,620
now in this video this is a clip from

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,890
the CES show earlier this year and

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,260
you'll see our CEO Steve and and Sarah

00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,150
one of the lead engineers on the project

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,740
they're going to show you the drones

00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,710
flying around now keep in mind when you

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,670
watch these drones flying around they're

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:51,530
navigating with great precision indoors

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:54,740
without any GPS they're using only the

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,690
camera and while they're doing that at

00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,160
the same time they're doing all the

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,350
flight control they're also doing this

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,570
categorization and machine learning and

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,330
they're doing it all on the device in a

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,340
on a board that only weighs 15 grams and

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,160
this is a case where we we rarely don't

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,170
talk about the mass of the processor but

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,240
in this case the mass really matters

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,010
because it reduces the weight and

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,420
therefore increases the flight time and

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:21,770
a smaller battery and so forth now comes

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,780
the next big task

00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,150
the drones do not know ahead of time

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,040
what they'll encounter in the room so

00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,200
they're gonna have to identify objects

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,840
that come into view in real time as they

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,430
navigate the course we're seeing some

00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,610
streaming video come in from the drones

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,740
you tell us what's going on so this is

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,480
live video from the rear drone as you

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,490
can see it's identifying objects that

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,710
come into view using its camera and an

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,420
on device machine learning model that

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,430
model is running in the Snapdragon

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,170
neural processing engine concurrently

00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,320
with Snapdragon navigator as it moves

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,970
around the course the Sara they look to

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,300
be speeding up you tell us a little bit

00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,180
more

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,130
I sure can so we really wanted to push

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,660
things even further here we can make

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,550
this happen using the Snapdragon

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,350
navigator software it offers real

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,880
state-of-the-art real time flight

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,010
control with advanced safety and

00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,750
autonomous features real-time flight

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,060
control is important it means the drones

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,360
can take desired speed and direction and

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,010
translate them into motor commands and

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:26,000
GPS doesn't work well for positioning

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:28,910
indoors okay that was really really fun

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,420
we actually have a Slavs indoor we have

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:34,220
outdoors in San Diego a flight center

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,690
that's really close to miles from a

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,870
military airport and we got special

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,300
permission to operate in concert with

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,210
connectivity to the air traffic control

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,550
and we're doing tests of this using

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,860
cellular as the connective connection

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,750
method and its really working great in

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,150
fact we published a paper on all the

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,150
issues there and if you're interested in

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:59,630
that okay now in the last part of this

00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:01,250
talk I'm going to talk about 5g which is

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,030
the next generation of cellular

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,220
technology

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,800
that's coming fast it's a really big

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,430
project for us and others we've been

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,330
working on it for four years already and

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:14,630
you're gonna start to see this

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,790
commercially launched around the 2019

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,710
time frame there's gonna be some

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,390
precursor activities already next year

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,860
there'll be some stuff at the Olympics

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,920
in Korea a couple other things

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,080
Verizon's doing some things but the the

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,930
the main stream is going to arrive

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,500
around 2019 which by the way is a year

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,180
acceleration it used to be 2020 and it's

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,490
going to be we called a unifying

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,460
connectivity fabric because it's going

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:44,120
to combine high-speed in other words

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,740
just making your 4G faster so you can do

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,940
all the things you do today at higher

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,350
speed you can pull and vide more videos

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,450
your web access will be faster all those

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,060
things will just be faster same service

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,430
but faster but also new services that

00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,930
come about with very low latency and

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,900
very high reliability and we'll talk a

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,520
little bit about that and

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,530
mission-critical services that are well

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,970
suited for like Public Safety or smart

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,070
cities or things that need to be very

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,350
reliable and then massive Internet of

00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:15,800
Things where we have tiny devices that

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:17,600
are very low cost and huge numbers many

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,370
many you know as many as a hundred

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,130
thousand and it's in a sector of a base

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,140
station and still the access technology

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,420
will will allow that to be efficient and

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:30,860
low-power so all of those together

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:35,210
unified is what we think of when we

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,760
think of 5g and we talk about cutting

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,870
every cord so again this gets back to

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,300
the the topic we had earlier which is

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,310
where you can do processing if you think

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,580
about

00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,830
a traditional desktop PC sitting on your

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,060
desk and it's got a monitor and there's

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,040
a little cable that goes between the

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,960
monitor and the box and then there's

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,440
like an Ethernet or Wi-Fi that comes out

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,920
the box to go to the Internet why is it

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,080
that way it's it's that way because we

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,840
initially put the wireless interface

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,340
where the network interface was we

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,940
didn't think to put the wireless

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,590
interface where the monitor was plugged

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,180
in because if you cut that cable if you

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,150
cut the HDMI cable

00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,400
then you need Gigabit link at low

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,370
latency so you didn't do that you cut it

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,700
you put it on the other side but we're

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,620
bringing in a world now where we will

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,590
have gigabit links of low latency at

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,080
reasonable cost and mobile with large

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,120
numbers of users and so it is possible

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,830
to cut to make the interface at a

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,990
different point in the architecture and

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,360
and realize some some really interesting

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:46,240
benefits so that's what we're thinking

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,640
about with 5g we can use it for an

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,730
interface into a residential unit we can

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,050
place the displays on different sides of

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,700
the link we can do wire bowls in

00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:59,410
different ways we can put in machine

00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,230
learning in different ways so in this in

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:05,860
this kind of depiction we're talking

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,650
about XR which is kind of a combination

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:13,000
of augmented reality and virtual reality

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:14,950
when we call it extended reality so if

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,480
you put on goggles and you and you see

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,370
only two display and the world is

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,350
completely virtual that's virtual

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,720
reality if you're holding up your phone

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,730
and you're seeing augment you see what

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,100
the real world is with some graphics on

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,580
top that's augmented reality if you have

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,140
glasses that can see the real world with

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,870
the real light you know like real

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,790
glasses do with augmented mentation on

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,190
top of that that's kind of mixed reality

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,740
or XR you can think of companies like

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,350
magic leap and a couple others we think

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,390
this is very important this is a

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,340
potentially at long last a new form

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,560
factor that's going to become popular

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,120
now not today because they're still big

00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,720
and expensive but they're making that

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:59,320
huge and huge strides and remember 5g

00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:03,250
starts around roughly 2020 and goes 4/5

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:06,460
teen years let's say to 2035 so in the

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,350
middle of that span the PC is 50 years

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,840
old that smartphone is like 30 years old

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,880
and the question is is that little

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,030
rectangle going to be the form factor we

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,170
have in 2025 I think it'll still be

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:23,560
around but you're going to see a lot

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:26,740
more of this kind of concept okay

00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,510
IOT so this graphic is just trying to

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,090
depict that there's lots of dots and

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,370
what we mean by that is anything that

00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,100
consumes a resource or can be measured

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,290
or has any kind of parameter on it can

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,000
now be connected at low cost the battery

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,980
can last many years without replacement

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,140
you can have a very deep link budget so

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,630
you can put it downstairs and the

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,330
network can actually handle the access

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,250
of a large a huge number of terminals

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,650
because we're very carefully designed

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,140
the access protocols so that they can be

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:59,050
efficient and you can get you know the

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,120
data from your sensors and not have to

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,650
have a large you know annual or monthly

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,790
cost to offer that connectivity so that

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,030
with the machine learning and the cloud

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:12,130
is really going to increase our ability

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:14,860
to utilize resources transportation

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,440
resources emergency responder resources

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,730
building infrastructure power energy all

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,500
those things is going to be more

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,620
efficiently used because of what this is

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,310
going to enable and in fact I should

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,080
mention in the standards process for 5g

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:32,500
traditionally you know 4g 3g 2g were

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,480
created by the telecom companies and

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,550
that's still the case but there are far

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,260
more companies participating there's

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:42,430
like a thousand companies participating

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,080
now from all different industries in the

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,510
5g process more than ever

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,630
so those inputs are being are being

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,280
taken in to design these use cases it's

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,810
no longer just a three-minute voice call

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:59,590
it's completely moved beyond that okay

00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:02,080
so I kind of mentioned this high

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,630
reliability low latency high

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,950
availability and let me just take a

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:10,510
second to talk about the low latency

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:12,490
part on today's 4G networks we can get

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,090
down to on the order of 10 milliseconds

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,150
and I'm

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:18,310
talking about the radio part with 5g

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,230
we'll be able to get to a millisecond or

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:24,280
in some cases even less than a

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:25,990
millisecond and that will allow again

00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,360
processing to be done in a different way

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,750
it will allow real-time applications

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,180
control applications it will allow AR VR

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,820
and with new architectures where you can

00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,530
have tremendous processing power however

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,050
this is important for this audience to

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,850
do this keep in mind it's not enough

00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:46,120
just to take the latency of the radio

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:48,370
down to a millisecond in many cases the

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,490
the the entity that you're interacting

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:55,990
with the server if it's a game server or

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:57,700
a video of VR or if it's you know

00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,850
something related to a mission critical

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,590
application it can't just be 100

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,640
milliseconds away in the in the cloud it

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:08,710
has to be also relatively close or what

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,800
we call the edge so this brings in the

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:15,640
notion of edge computing and to give you

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,380
an example two weeks ago to three weeks

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,920
ago I was up here at the Mobile World

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,510
Congress and at the Verizon booth I saw

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:28,240
what I thought was a really cool demo

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:29,290
they had a drone it wasn't a nice well I

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,440
shouldn't say nice it was not an

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:34,150
expensive Joan it was a very low cost

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,280
$18 tiny little drone about this size

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,780
and the only thing this drone had was a

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,640
camera that could send back its pictures

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,720
and they were flying it around and they

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,090
had a balloon a red balloon in this net

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,440
and this little tiny drone would send

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,750
its video back and they had edge

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,360
processing and it would process the

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,310
video search for the balloon and send

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,920
back control and allowed this little

00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,930
tiny drone which only costs $18 to chase

00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,870
the balloon around indoors and be

00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:04,450
precise but they had to have the

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,340
processing at low latency they would

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,280
then switch it to a distant they had a

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,470
AWS setup that was far away was like 50

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,380
milliseconds away and once they switched

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:16,960
to that the control loop was not

00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,870
possible to maintain anymore so that was

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,790
an example that you need the high

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,940
performance radio link and

00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:27,700
the network capability of processing

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,160
that's relatively proximate together

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:33,460
then that unlocks the this whole new

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,860
world of these types of applications so

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,450
just trying to point that out okay I

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,820
think I'm almost at the end here oh

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,460
that's the end okay so that's kind of a

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,610
an overview of you know what we're going

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,830
where we're going with 5g where we're
