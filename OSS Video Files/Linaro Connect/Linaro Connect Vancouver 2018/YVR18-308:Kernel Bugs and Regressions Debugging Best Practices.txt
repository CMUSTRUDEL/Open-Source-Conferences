Title: YVR18-308:Kernel Bugs and Regressions Debugging Best Practices
Publication date: 2018-10-16
Playlist: Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018
Description: 
	This demo will be based on real work done for real bug cases. It will show some of my best practices in putting together an environment ready for bug resolution: Quick virtual machine cloning, containers, dev boxes, Debian packaging, debug symbols, kernel cross compilation and automation, crash dump generation on different boards,  kdump analysis for both arm32 & arm64, and how to interpret a stack trace and quickly identify possible root cause of the issue.
