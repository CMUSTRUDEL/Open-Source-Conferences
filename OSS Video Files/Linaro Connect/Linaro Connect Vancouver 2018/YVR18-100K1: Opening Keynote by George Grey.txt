and a vennett thank you so much we

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:13,559
really appreciate your support and so

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,240
just a little bit of an overview of the

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,130
layout of the hotel and how the meetings

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,710
are gonna work so basically obviously

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,510
this is the Grand Ballroom over here in

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,930
this corner is session room one on the

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,090
other side of this wall session room two

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,160
is here session room three is on the

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,990
other side over here and then the light

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,540
hacking room is over here on this side

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,149
and there are other meeting rooms on

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,950
this third floor of the hotel and in

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,809
fact two of the important meeting rooms

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,430
are on the other side of the elevators

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,989
there is Balmoral and Prince Prince of

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,190
Wales and those are the steering

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,239
committee meeting rooms for the whole

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,829
week so if you have a steering committee

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,000
meeting during the week that you're

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,190
going to attend it's in one of those

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,629
rooms on this floor but we also have a

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,480
couple of meeting rooms on the second

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,140
floor and you there are there are

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,609
escalators right out in front of the

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,890
registration area so you can easily get

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,570
up and down there there are also hacking

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,830
rooms on the fourth floor above us

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,090
that's where all the hacking rooms are

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,850
with the exception of light that's over

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,070
here so and for that you take the

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,510
elevator or you can take the stairs the

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,640
stairs are really accessible at this

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,920
hotel which is I think is nice and then

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,689
the other floor that we have meeting

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,610
rooms in is the 34th floor so it's a

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,170
very top floor of the hotel pretty good

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,840
views from up there there's a bunch of

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,220
meeting rooms up there and so that's the

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,200
general layout of where things are

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,030
happening

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,750
AAA or a scarm anything which is a

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,490
really popular interesting way that we

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,930
kick off after the keynotes well that's

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,850
going to take place in session room one

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,530
over here and you need to be a member

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,150
because it has to obviously be an NDA in

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,280
place with arm there but that's always a

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,689
really interesting and lively meeting so

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,890
that's going to take place here right

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,570
after we're done with all the pictures

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,759
or actually I think it starts at 11

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,270
o'clock and then if you're in the Lennar

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,270
field or services or support team we're

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,229
gonna meet starting at noon up on the

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,939
34th floor in Seymour and then one thing

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,350
we learned last time was it's better to

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,000
have lunch spread over a longer period

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,950
because people are doing all sorts of

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,420
things so this it's 12:00 to 2:00

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,129
basically Monday through Thursday this

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,920
week it's on the second floor the floor

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,900
below us right now

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,410
and then this afternoon sessions will

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,540
start about two o'clock and then at five

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,280
o'clock in this room if you're an

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,140
employee of one arrow or an assignee

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,370
please come here and we're gonna have

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,930
our traditional meeting you know we have

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,870
passable we're using passable again

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,460
there's an app for your phone you can

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,010
get it on the web you can download it

00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,530
for your phone it's not a unique app

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,660
each time so when you go in to this on

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,010

registration desk and they can help you

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,980
with any questions the other thing is if

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,960
you're from 1ro and you want to talk to

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,210

00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,990

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,190
any sort of HR related issues so she's

00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,080
available actually I don't think you

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,370

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,330
Diana would be happy to talk to anybody

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,280
that would like to come by and I'm told

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,690
that the Wi-Fi network here this week

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,130
will be very good it's it's totally

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,420
solid obviously we're in a great

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,940
location because we're right in the

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,500
center of Vancouver and outside around

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,800
us is just everything is within walking

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:16,160
distance so we planned a very special

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,510
day for Wednesday Wednesday is a special

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,710
day since last connect well we sort of

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,840
took a break during the week and we

00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,250
don't have normal sessions there are no

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,630
steering committee meetings that take

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,320
place on Wednesday so it's right in the

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,910
middle of the week and it's a nice

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,920
time there's all sorts of hacking goes

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,620
on on Wednesday whole day hacking and

00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,770
then we also plan this AI and neural

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,600
network on arm summit and we have some

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,740
phenomenal speakers and I'll share with

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,060
you tomorrow morning a little bit more

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,170
but you you go to the connect website

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,880
and find out more details

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,990
I'll show them with you tomorrow that

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,240
will be a great day so if you're

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,390
interested in AI or neural networks on

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,550
arm we've really planned for a very

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:53,960
interesting set of discussions and

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,310
topics there and it should be wonderful

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,620
also you know every time we come back to

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,290
connect Dave Piggott insists he is the

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,150
smartest person in this room and as part

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:08,580
of that we have to take this challenge

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:12,420
and so if you look at your guard on the

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,520
inside page there's a puzzle here and

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,290
that's Dave's puzzle for this connect

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,300
and there are fabulous prizes that have

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,530
been arranged for that person who can

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,510
figure out this puzzle actually the

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,970
first two people who can figure out this

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:27,380
puzzle and prove that Dave once again is

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,380
not the smartest person in this room

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,480
there is one addition there are four

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,190
digits missing from four characters the

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,410
first four characters are missing from

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,870
the event guide those are them right

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,670
there and you can also go to the URL and

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,630
and get the accurate details there as

00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:48,270
well we also have a special hackathon

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,310

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,800
after the end of George's keynote at the

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,210
very end we're gonna file out here and

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,830
take the escalators down to the second

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,270
floor and just pop out on the on the

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,770
plaza the patio out there

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,270
and we'll take a group photo this was

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,500
the one that we did in in Hong Kong

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,479
actually I think it's really an

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,280
excellent an excellent photo of a group

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,440
photo and then if you're a member of a

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,080
steering committee please stay after the

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,240
whole all of us get taken and they're

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,909
gonna do a steering committee photo as

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,979
well so we're gonna have fun here this

00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:49,469
week too it's a lot of hard work and and

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,729
learning and overcoming challenges but

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,409
let's have some fun while we're here as

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:54,090
well and so we do have some events

00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:55,229
planned this week tonight are the team

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,620
dinners

00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:01,770
Tuesday is a steering committee evening

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,030
by invitation Wednesday we've planned

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,409
for something a little bit different

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,599
this time there's a beer and pizza night

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:09,000
and it's actually not at the hotel it's

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,039
right by the hotel so everyone's invited

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,719

you're just going to that

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,240
recession impassable that should be a

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,770
lot of fun and on Thursday we're

Friday so let's really have a good week

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,010
let's let's let's do all the work all

00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,370
the great work and learn a lot of stuff

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,839
as part of being here and and and

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,520
approach the challenges that we have and

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,399
the work that we do but let's have some

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,140
fun while we're doing it as well so

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,270
please join me in welcoming one of the

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:55,360
highlights of every connect and that's

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:57,610
George Gray and his keynote George one

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
two three thanks Joe

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,380
not sure about you putting the Dave

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,490
bigger puzzle in at the beginning I

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,580
think you should have done it at the end

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:09,250
because I can see already some people

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:12,250
starting to try and get a head start

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:16,000
welcome again to connect this is the

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:18,880
24th it goes up by one every time and

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,709
I'm always astonished by how many times

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,980
we've done this this has been eight

00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:26,620
years it's been an amazing eight years

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:31,240
for all of us and I'm very pleased to be

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,680
here today so a couple of quick slides

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,740
if you don't know what we do you

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,860
probably shouldn't be here this is where

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,220
the arm ecosystem collaborates on

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:46,089
open-source software and we have now

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,640
over 300 engineers working on Lennar o

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:51,220
projects under the direction of our

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:56,010
members from companies all over the

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:58,899
world and a lot of those projects cover

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:05,100
most of the open-source spectrum from

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:08,709
IOT devices to tools to edge to

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,300
networking and and server and now a lot

00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,829
of activity over the last six months

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,540
you're going to hear about this week

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:18,579
over in terms of HPC so Lenora is

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,240
involved in a huge number of open-source

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:25,300
projects and as a result i'm very proud

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,550
to say that Lennar o has joined the GPL

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,040
cooperation commitment i'm

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,839
sure how many of you know about this if

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,870
you don't you should and so I'm going to

00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,610
ask Jeff Kaufman open source IP counsel

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,019
from Red Hat to come and tell you a

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,019
little bit about it Joe

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,190
[Applause]

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,000
George thanks for inviting me here to

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,150
speak I am very excited to be here at

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,610
Lennar I'll connect here in Vancouver

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,990
let's talk about open source I started

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,440
my career as an embedded systems

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,770
programmer back in 1991 programming

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,940
little 8-bit microcontrollers and

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:16,470
coincidentally that's the same year that

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,720
the GPL version 2 was born and frankly

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,470
back then I did not know how to spell

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,720
GPL and sadly I wasn't aware of what

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,390
open source was or anything about the

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,730
collaborative software development and

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,130
proprietary in my world was the dominant

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,680
development model and looking back I

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,950
realized how unfortunate this was and

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,020
how things would have been better for me

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:43,230
and has just been so exciting to see the

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,720
dramatic evolution from proprietary to

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,700
community-based development using open

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,500
source licensing and for the last many

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,630
decades has been the driver for a

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,450
significant amount of the innovative

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,620
products and solutions developed today

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,620
including solutions developed by all of

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,750
you the benefits of open source are

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,740
understood by all of us the Lonardo

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,200
community and an us at Red Hat so open

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,900
source software works in part due to

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,480
licensing structures that reduce

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,940
friction for use in distribution but

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,240
there are also social norms that must be

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,450
followed to ensure its continued success

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,700
so what do I mean by this by way of

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,150
background the GPL or the general public

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,160
license is a very popular and important

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,830
license and it's one of the key

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,170
attributes of the GPL as its copyleft

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:38,000
provisions which ensure that software

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:42,090
remains free to run copy distribute

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,250
study change and improve and as a matter

00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:47,370
of fact the Linux kernel is licensed

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:50,340
under version 2 of the GPL and although

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,750
the GPL has these great attributes it

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,180
also comes with terms that must be

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:57,210
followed and these terms can be a bit

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,430
confusing especially for those new using

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,410
the license and the harsh reality is

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,350
that when you do not comply with the

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,720
terms of the GPL version 2 the

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,340
license automatically terminates and you

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,220
may become a copyright infringer and

00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:15,510
potentially liable for damages not a

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,820
happy place and this is an incentive to

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,650
follow the rules of the GPL and you

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,160
should be following the rules of the GPL

00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,960
to ensure those freedoms sadly there are

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,910
some socially insensitive and

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,280
opportunistic individuals and companies

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,490
that take advantage of this termination

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,620
clause and use it to profit from other

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,710
people's innocent mistakes and this

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,100
hurts the open-source communities so

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,500
let's be fair people make mistakes and

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,970
sometimes people simply innocently

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,860
misunderstand some of the requirements

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,350
of the GPL they should be given an

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,970
opportunity to correct those mistakes

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:54,720
before they're GPL licensed terminates

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,960
so realizing this the now current

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,480
version of the GPL version 3 has a cure

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,580
provision and it allows people a certain

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,710
amount of time to correct or cure their

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,270
mistakes before the GPL license

00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,270
terminates which seems fair

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:19,840
so this is Wilin ro RedHat and over 20

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,690
other companies leading companies and

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,120
nearly 200 individual developers have

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:29,110
adopted the GPL cooperation commitment

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,290
for their GPL license code or version to

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,270
license software the GPL cooperation

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,520
commitment allows people a time to

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,550
correct their mistakes for improper use

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,040
of edgy PL version 2 code exactly what

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,500
has already allowed under version 3 of

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,420
the GPL this is important because there

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,580
are significant amount of open source

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,210
software and projects that continue to

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:57,370
be licensed under version 2 of the GPL

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:59,710
so now I invite all of you to sign up to

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,220
this initiative simply go to this URL

00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:05,650
and sign up take a picture

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,730
share it with your friends light up

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:12,130
twitter the hashtag GPL CC and even if

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,290
you don't own any GPL version 2 code you

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:17,020
can still sign up to show your support

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:19,030
and further instill these social norms

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,070
for dealing with innocent mistakes and

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,340
provide greater predictability and

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,050
open-source licensing for all of us I

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,240
invite you to contact me at the email

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,770
address here if you have any questions

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,770
thank you for your time today

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:46,810
thanks Gil okay good news so I am going

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:49,690
to talk a little bit about 2018 it's

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,300
been an interesting year so far and I'm

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,530
sure we haven't finished it yet I'm

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,210
going to talk a little bit about arm on

00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:59,620
arm and activity on machine intelligence

00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:02,440
the last six months seems to have gone

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,760
very quickly from advanced intelligence

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,750
being a little bit of an advanced

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:11,500
technology to being here today and I'm

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:12,850
going to talk about automotive the

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,800
growth of the ninety six boards

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:19,750
ecosystem and then a little bit about

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:24,700
IOT and edge so sometimes it feels like

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:29,550
the world is on fire it's been a very

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:34,330
interesting year I think for everybody I

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:36,490
like to think that progress is always up

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,910
and to the right but it's not it's not

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:43,660
linear like many other things in life

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:46,120
sometimes we move forward to steps and

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,280
sometimes we take one back and it seems

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:54,070
like in a lot of ways we've taken one

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:57,340
back globally over the last year so we

00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:02,020
have tariffs we have sanctions we have

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:04,480
protectionism I'm hopeful that these

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,420
things will pass I don't think the world

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,180
is a better place when we restrict trade

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:14,560
when we a protectionist ik when we

00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:18,579
retreat into our own countries but even

00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,530
if it does pass as a result directly of

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,020
what's been happening over the last few

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,569
years businesses and governments are

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,840
having to review their global supply

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:32,580
chains and their interdependence and

00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,580
this affects all of us in this room

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:40,090
China in particular under the direction

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,820
of its government for very good reasons

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,340
is building out its own IT

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:50,140
infrastructure using locally developed

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:55,740
IP everything from SOC s to the cloud

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:59,680
and this is a huge an ambitious project

00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:05,200
it's one that hopefully will benefit the

00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:10,920
world and we shouldn't abour it we

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:14,460
should embrace it because there are two

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:18,040
particular partners who china are

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,520
working with to make this happen and a

00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,290
whole bunch of other open-source

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,610
projects and technology are being used

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:30,370
for this effort and arm in terms of

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,400
being able to license IP that can then

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:38,020
be built upon by companies anywhere in

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:41,530
the world and Lennar o who is working on

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:44,680
open source software globally are two

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:47,110
very important partners for anybody who

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,650
wants to build their own IT ecosystem

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:55,720
around computing and using collaborative

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,040
development so why why open source why

00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,760
not just go and create everything

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,740
completely proprietary and the reason

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:07,570
there are many reasons right that

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:09,760
markets are global if I am building a

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:14,230
product I want to sell it to every

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,750
citizen on the planet open-source is

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:20,620
visible to everybody there are no

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:23,590
secrets there are no boundaries it's

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:27,820
it's very difficult to restrict the flow

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:31,240
of open source and no country or

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:34,180
corporation owns the work it is

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,080
distributed it's available to everybody

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:40,170
and everybody can contribute to it and

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:46,050
improve it

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:46,050
now of course open-source is an enabler

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:53,009
commercial IP could and should be

00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:57,269
developed on top of open-source

00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:59,639
platforms if you want to build a special

00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:01,590
kind of proprietary security for your

00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:05,130
own application or for your own country

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,049
you should be able to do that but you

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,960
should be able to do it on top of an

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:12,679
existing open platform that everybody

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,509
can see because if you don't do that

00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,220
then nobody will buy your product nobody

00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:22,919
will use your product because they don't

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:25,049
know what's inside so I actually think

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,600
that open source is one of the bright

00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:30,779
lights of what is happening in the world

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,960
today in terms of technology and

00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:36,570
technology development and so the work

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:41,250
that we are all doing is I think

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:46,080
incredibly important so let's talk a

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:49,889
little bit about arm on arm and this is

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,080
the story about why are we not building

00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:55,740
all of our software on ARM processors

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,929
and you all know why it's easier and

00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,970
faster to build it on the cloud in big

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:04,440
big servers but things are changing and

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,440
what we want to be able to do is have

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,299
everybody have a choice if you want to

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,149
build software on arm you should be able

00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:15,450
to so how are we doing we talked about

00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:17,580
this six months ago and a year ago and

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:20,730
this is about building any software you

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:23,419
want on arm not just software for arm

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,100
not just native but if you want to build

00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:29,340
software for another processor for an

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:32,009
Intel processor or anything else you

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,799
should be able to do that so how are we

00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:37,379
doing well it's getting easier that's

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,169
the good news we have a range of

00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:42,330
development boards we've always had not

00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:45,779
much fun compiling kernels on raspberry

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:49,679
PI's but you can do it and then things

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:51,690
like dragon board and the Heike and some

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,110
of the activities and 96 boards have

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,570
made a big difference we're also seeing

00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:01,370
arm Chromebooks

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:05,900
we have the HP Envy x2 which is the

00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:09,350
Windows 10 arm product that uses a

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:13,250
Qualcomm chip and can also run Linux so

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,750
you Linux on Windows so you can take a

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,260
look at one or two of those people are

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:20,000
carrying them around and using them

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,240
you've seen this in Queisser developer

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,730
box we showed that last time and I'm

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,190
very pleased to say that Marvel have

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,200
bought a system here that's outside you

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,880
can see that talk a little bit more

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,050
about at the moment and we're also going

00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,860
to talk a little bit about the developer

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:39,620
cloud so you can build arm software or

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:44,030
any other software on a whole variety of

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:48,860
arm hardwork in particular the thunder

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:52,460
x2 is the new chip from Marvel

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,560
it's SPSA and SBB are compliant John

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,660
masters would say it's very boring and

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,090
he'd say that's a very good thing this

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,810
is a powerful machine it has a server

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:06,560
class SOC in it it has up to a terabyte

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:10,580
of RAM and you can use it as a powerful

00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,280
workstation so you can see one outside

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,050
whole week get your hands on it and play

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,600
with it and you can also buy them from

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:21,710
Marvel's partners who are actually

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:26,690
manufacturing them so how does the

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:29,900
software doing we also provide access to

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:32,030
arm servers in the cloud and so I'm

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,620
going to ask Martin Stadler who's the

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,020
senior director of the Lennar o Data

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,720
Center and cloud group used to be le G

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,000
now LD CG and some of his team to come

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,860
up and update you on what's been going

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,860
on on the developer cloud Martin

00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:52,749
thank you George all right if you've

00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:55,210
been to a Kinect before you've heard us

00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:56,710
talk about the developer cloud we have

00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,259
some significant updates what we thought

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:06,039
would be good for us to just briefly

00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:08,049
talk about so I have Kyle and Jorge

00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:10,179
Jorge is the developer cloud tech lead

00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:13,330
college one of the technologists very

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:14,619
responsible for the work that we're

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,389
gonna do around the developer cloud

00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,869
which we'll demonstrate but let me tell

00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:22,629
you a couple of key highlights first of

00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:25,330
all anybody can put an OpenStack cloud

00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:27,129
together on any sort of processor and

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,279
what I'm glad to really report is that

00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:32,679
we now have the work that we've been

00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,649
doing inside of Lenora inside of the

00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,529
OpenStack Foundation as part of that

00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:40,299
passing 100% interoperability

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:42,279
certification this is a key achievement

00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:44,950
it's the only one that we're aware of

00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,989
that's on arm it also means that we're

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:51,220
now able to enter up be interoperable

00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:55,389
with other OpenStack clouds that could

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,429
be x86 or PowerPC whatever it is we are

00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:59,169
working with the OpenStack foundation to

00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,809
try and figure out how we can actually

00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:04,139
be certified because this is also the

00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:06,759
first time that the open-source

00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:08,850
effort actually is the one that's

00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,940
certified instead of the company product

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:14,559
that's number one

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,940
the next thing as many of you know and

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,309
and we've had a lot of people sign up

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,749
for the developer cloud there's been a

00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,859
lot of demand for it and this is a

00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:25,029
really good story around arm and arm

00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,529
mission really has been to be able to

00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:30,580
provide that to the community and

00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:33,549
partners and the members and we've got

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,830
data centers still in Shanghai in London

00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:38,529
and in Austin Texas

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:40,419
but what we are doing now is taking it

00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:42,850
out of beta and we're putting it into

00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:44,230
production so what does that mean it

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,049
means that you have full support

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,539
you have the reliability but it also

00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:53,320
means that what we used to give away for

00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:55,729
free will now entail small fee

00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,190
that is to keep the lights on in the

00:25:55,729 --> 00:26:00,469
data centers and to keep enough of

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:04,609
resources to be able to watch and manage

00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:06,169
them so instead of me sitting here and

00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:11,629
talking what I'd like to do is hand it

00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:13,239
over to working and thanks Marty so we

00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:16,580
have been working to make this process

00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:19,190
simpler for the users so in a way that

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,739
you can sign up pretty easily and then

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,889
buy a project so Kylie's gonna show us

00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:28,039
the process of signing up so this is the

00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:31,279
new developer cloud website you can sign

00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:33,229
up log in from the home page once you've

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,440
signed up you'll receive a activation

00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:39,409
email click it confirm your account and

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,679
then complete your registration so we'll

00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:45,309
login with a account that we have

00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,309
already set up

00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,970
so once you've logged in you can choose

00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,250
your preferred zone and flavor I've got

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:07,700
three zones to choose from China UK and

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:11,960
USA we've got four flavors also now no

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:14,360
small medium and large so yeah you can

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,960
go to the website choose your flavor and

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,190
then once you've purchased you can head

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,550
over to my account and into the

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:28,280
dashboard view your subscriptions and

00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:37,810
from here you can access the OpenStack

00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:41,780
project and manage your instance so

00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:42,980
after you complete the purchase you're

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,380
going to jump into the OpenStack

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,500
dashboard we have three different for

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,960
each region that we have in this case we

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,230
are jumping into the educational so this

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,330
is a pretty standard OpenStack dashboard

00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,800
intelligent running horizon so here you

00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,780
can see an overview of their resources

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,420
that you have so for this particular

00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:05,840
project we have 24 busy views and close

00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,870
to 30 gigs of RAM so the process of

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,720
spinning up instances on an OpenStack

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:16,120
cloud so you have to click on their

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,120
compute then you go to instances

00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:27,260
you click on launch instance you gotta

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:28,970
pick a name so I'm gonna say demo so the

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,860
amount of instances that you want to run

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:36,470
so I would say 3 so we have plenty

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:40,760
choices for images I will use the Bionic

00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:42,740
or one - LTS which is the latest one so

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,310
you can pick a flavor of course the

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,590
flavor has to be under the boundaries of

00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:51,460
the resources that you have available

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:54,620
for this project so I will pick nano and

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,090
then I will click on lunch instance so

00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,840
this will go through the process of

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:08,390
scheduling building and running the

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:10,580
beams on each hypervisor so it's going

00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,190
to schedule then build this might take a

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,470
few minutes so after this is done you

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:19,300
can click on associate a floating IP and

00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:22,160
this will give you a internet IP before

00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:26,120
so you can access the instance from the

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,280
internet so of course you can deploy

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,590
some more complicated things or some

00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:34,520
more complex software stacks such as a

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,110
Canary's cluster you can use almost any

00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,140
of the deployment tools that we have

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:41,570
right now such as uu and civil or

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:44,660
terraform so in this case I use do you

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:48,560
for deploying these six nodes coronaries

00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:51,500
cluster it has six machines and each of

00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:55,280
those are using a nano flavor which just

00:29:51,500 --> 00:30:00,380
one B CPU and four gigs of RAM so all of

00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:02,510
these cores running on top of one 64 so

00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,550
you can of course also jump into the

00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:12,830
coronaries dashboard and see the nodes

00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:14,930
so each node we have two of them they

00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:20,840
are running containers running on top of

00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:22,970
I'm 64 so I think it makes good demo of

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,910
what we can do on top of the developer

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,050
cloud we would like to invite you to

00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:32,340
test the service

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:34,080
we are open to questions on one thing

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,300
all right great thank you very much for

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,550
the demo we are thinking about doing a

00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:42,000
Q&A session on Wednesday maybe around

00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:44,040
10:30 but TBD if if we get that done

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:55,020
we'll you'll see it impassable all right

00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:57,270
thank you thanks very much Martin so

00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,820
actually if you think about what you've

00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:02,270
just seen so firstly we're not going to

00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:05,910
become Amazon we're not going into the

00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:07,950
data center business what we're really

00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:11,070
trying to do here at Lennar o is give

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:13,710
the ecosystem early access to the latest

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,960
hardware from our members we couldn't do

00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:18,300
this without the members of LD CG

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,430
they're all donating hardware and their

00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,760
latest hardware so you can actually

00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:26,220
really start to see that you can do all

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,670
of this just as easily unarmed as any

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:33,870
other architecture and the difference is

00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:36,120
that we are not providing long-term

00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,460
commercial support for this that's up to

00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,490
there other vendors there are vendors in

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,500
the market who are like packet but this

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,200
is a complete implementation running on

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,100
a range of different latest hardware and

00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,510
you have the complete open source

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,990
implementation available to you you can

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:58,260
build this yourself from scratch

00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:01,680
absolutely as we have created it so we

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:04,230
hope you'll use it we will with our

00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,570
members scale it up according to use but

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,400
we're hoping over time that the big

00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,580
commercial providers will start to

00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,770
actually give everybody a choice of arm

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,990
servers in what they're doing and this I

00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,510
think is a major step towards that so

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:21,710
well done to the entire team and also to

00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:24,710
the members who are supporting this

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,710
right

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:32,330
so that's the hardware we've now got a

00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:35,250
choice of hardware from laptops to

00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:37,500
workstations to the cloud but how are we

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,510
doing on software how are we doing in

00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,880
terms of building natively on arm how

00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,840
are the development tools coming well

00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,790
you can build tiyanak or UEFI you boot

00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,250
ebbr compliance software as that that

00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:52,350
specification completes that is all

00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:55,350
being developed natively on arm today

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:59,100
and many of the major commercial and

00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:01,790
open distributions you can also build

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:05,330
arm natively on arms so debian fedora

00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,760
open SUSE open man driver and others

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,590
there's still more to do though

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,100
particularly in the embedded and IOT

00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:16,440
space people who build embedded products

00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,230
believe it or not still use very very

00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,820
old versions of Windows I've been in a

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:27,150
major corporation where state-of-the-art

00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:34,410
development of embedded software was

00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:36,030
being done on Windows 3 why because the

00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,400
people who developed the tools that all

00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,460
the engineers knew had left and they

00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:44,910
didn't know what to do next

00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,830
so in the embedded space we still have a

00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:49,710
lot of fragmentation you can talk a

00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:51,690
little bit about this later but there is

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,210
more to do and some of the high

00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:57,150
priorities are to get some of the modern

00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,760
tools Yocto open embedded zephyr and

00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:02,540
other artists is building on arm with

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,580
arm tools so that you do have a choice

00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:10,560
so this is an activity that you'll hear

00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:12,110
more about this week ok let's talk a

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,470
little bit about machine intelligence

00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:18,240
machine learning deep learning even in

00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:20,400
the space of just six months this has

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,060
moved from a lot of companies working on

00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,150
this behind closed doors to a large

00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,070
number of companies working on IP 4

00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:32,340
machine intelligence across the entire

00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:37,320
spectrum from microcontrollers all the

00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:39,560
way up to two big iron servers an HPC it

00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,660
is becoming

00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:47,280
important and applicable to every area

00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:49,320
of Technology and business so what's

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,840
actually happening what's actually

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,780
happening is this is no longer something

00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,190
that's done on big iron in the cloud

00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:59,730
this is no longer something that needs

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:03,840
50,000 servers working on up in the

00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:05,820
cloud we're moving more and more compute

00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,060
to the edge we're moving it away from

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,400
the cloud and closer to devices and as

00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,780
we move to a world of 5g this is

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,030
becoming more important because the

00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,880
amount of data we are creating is just

00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,620
exploding and there just isn't the

00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,890
bandwidth and it doesn't make economic

00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:25,520
or power sense to send all that data up

00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:28,140
to the cloud and then bring it back

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,480
there's a lot of cases where we want to

00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,520
move that processing closer to the

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,320
sensors that are creating the data and

00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:40,290
send metadata to the cloud so what we're

00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,060
seeing is kind of as you would expect

00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,220
there's over to orders of magnitude

00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:48,000
power and performance improvement for

00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:52,890
certain algorithms if you have dedicated

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,470
hardware so historically GPUs nowadays

00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,050
augmented reality and of course machine

00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:00,240
learning algorithms and there's a lot of

00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,710
people creating innovative machine

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,460
learning algorithms we're just at the

00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:07,410
beginning of this of this new world and

00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:10,380
there are people using existing DSPs

00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:14,310
specially manual specially designed DSPs

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:19,260
FPGAs GPUs neural processing units full

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:21,390
custom hardware designs and neural

00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:27,080
networks and so on to try and tackle

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:30,360
this problem so a lot of fragmentation

00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:33,840
but there's this trend towards having

00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:37,530
either one or multiple dedicated

00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:42,540
Hardware engines on SOC s for specific

00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:45,390
tasks and the challenge is how do we

00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,340
cope with this explosion of IP this

00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:52,430
explosion of people building hardware

00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:56,060
into chips and efficiently allocate the

00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:59,690
many different IP resources Hardware

00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:03,440
resources to workloads tends to flow

00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:08,090
only supports a limited number of pieces

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,820
of hardware but what if we could use any

00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:15,260
hardware and there was a framework to

00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:17,990
enable the translation of tends to flow

00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:21,020
requirements and graphs to the hardware

00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:24,560
efficiently and effectively that each IP

00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:27,560
vendor only had to write once and it

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,850
would work with every it would work with

00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:34,310
every framework so this is an area that

00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:37,670
the Naro has identified as needing

00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:39,950
industry cooperation and the machine

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:44,270
intelligence initiative that was started

00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:47,360
by the Lennar o core members is aiming

00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:50,870
to optimize AI and machine learning deep

00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,980
learning performance and to create

00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:57,860
modular integration of open-source or

00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:01,130
proprietary vendor specific runtimes for

00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,080
vendor specific hardware and so this is

00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,750
going to need collaborative definition

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,050
of a common framework with inference

00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:11,930
api's and it's targeted not only at

00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:15,280
cortex a but also at cortex-m this also

00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:18,800
applies all the way down to sensors and

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,040
the current candidate that is being

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:26,300
looked at by this team that consists of

00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:28,670
arm Qualcomm and others is using onyx

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,560
and creating a plug-in architecture for

00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:35,440
onyx that will enable you to describe

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:39,830
your hardware IP in a plug-in framework

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,410
so I really hope that companies will get

00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:44,750
involved in this there's a lot of

00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:48,710
discussion on it this week

00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:50,990
this is not a low-cost exercise we need

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,960
to have some very bright people working

00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:57,220
on this project so we are asking you to

00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,580
fund it because otherwise we can't do it

00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:03,170
okay

00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:07,220
let's move move on to automotive there's

00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:12,320
a lot going on in automotive we're all

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:13,900
waiting for this to be our car so where

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,560
are we

00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,720
we're getting more and more

00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,500
sophisticated systems into production

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:25,910
cars somebody said that they estimate

00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:27,500
that in a modern luxury car there is

00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,320
probably a hundred million lines of

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,300
software code in a fully automated car

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,580
there's going to be over a billion lines

00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,810
and I don't think they're going to be

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,750
very easy to get through some of the

00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:41,240
safety certification standards so

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:44,630
there's a lot of work going on now in

00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:47,210
today's cars on technologies that are

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:50,270
being widely used across most of our

00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:52,160
members because ARM processors with

00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:54,470
their low-power characteristics and

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,770
their safety characteristics are very

00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,520
applicable for this kind of market and

00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:02,200
that includes

00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:05,390
Adar solutions today which are evolving

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,520
safety isolation so how do you isolate

00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:12,980
the safety system that has been approved

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,990
from the compute obviously ivi ECU

00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,480
updates cars are getting very

00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:20,420
complicated they have lots of computers

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,480
in them at the moment and so how do you

00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:25,760
actually update that software how do you

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:29,360
update the software in a car Nowhere

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,950
that software has come from and then be

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,630
able to transfer it to a new owner

00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:37,520
without any problems

00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,260
AUTOSAR is a industry organization

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,410
that's trying to specify how to deal

00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,940
with some of these issues and vehicle to

00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,430
vehicle and viet vehicle to

00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,590
infrastructure applications are starting

00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:51,470
to come from many of you in the room

00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,940
here today and of course vision today

00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,310
we're doing a lot of vision already

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,530
we've got rear facing cameras we've got

00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:00,500
cameras to detect cars coming along the

00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:02,750
side give us warning about objects in

00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,120
front of us and this is just the start

00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:08,930
of the move towards fully autonomous

00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:11,310
driving so Lennar o is where we should

00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:14,010
collaborate on these activities and i

00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:15,900
courage every member and companies who

00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:19,640
are not members to come together inland

00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,900
ro and work on open source software

00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,450
collaboration for your automatic the

00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,430
automotive software traditionally a lot

00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:29,100
of automotive software has not been

00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:31,410
open-source but it's now getting a big

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:35,520
market and it's too important to go and

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:37,670
fragment it so this work is being done

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,380
in the core systems technologies group

00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:43,500
and we need the members to get together

00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:46,350
and and identify what are the key areas

00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,480
to work in in this space so there will

00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:53,520
be discussions on this in the TSC

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:57,300
this this week in addition as I said

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,220
last time we want to start a autonomous

00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:03,420
vehicles initiative I talked a little

00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:08,850
bit about this at the automotive Linux

00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:12,630
conference recently in Tokyo because we

00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:17,610
need to have open source solutions for

00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:20,880
the future of autonomous driving we

00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:23,610
since the last meeting have come to an

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,000
agreement which we've announced with

00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:30,480
tier 4 tier 4 create software called

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,340
Auto ware which provides localization

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,240
route planning and mapping object

00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:38,160
detection and driving control but it

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,940
needs a lot of work from the community

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,650
to help make it a production quality

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,080
kind of product and there are a lot of

00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:49,200
companies who have taken it are using it

00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,900
to create proprietary IP that's great

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,310
but we need to feedback the results of

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,280
that and make the project better

00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:00,780
there's also Baidu's apollo project

00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:05,250
which has similar aims i'm going to show

00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:08,600
you a brief video from LG's team in the

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:11,670
valley and they have built a simulator

00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:15,840
for basically running simulations in

00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:18,510
Auto wear so you're going to see this on

00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,790
some models they've created which is

00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:23,840
essentially showing a simulation of auto

00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:27,140
we're actually driving in a car in sand

00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:31,280
sisqó so it's taking a simulation of the

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:33,290
lidar data and then using the map that's

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,750
been created and the lanes and knowing

00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,850
where they are to be able to navigate

00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,220
through and here what you see in the

00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:42,680
bottom left hand corner is also where

00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:45,290
identifying objects as the car is

00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,840
driving along that will be used to

00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,890
essentially make sure that even though

00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,660
you know you're supposed to go in a

00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:55,460
straight line there's objects in front

00:43:50,660 --> 00:44:05,390
of you so this work has been done by LG

00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:07,490
Labs in San Francisco and get involved

00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,580
in what we're doing this is an

00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,350
open-source project and we intend to

00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,790
actually link it in what we'd like to do

00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:20,420
is link it into the work that we're

00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:23,120
doing with tr4 on auto where so what

00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,400
we're doing at the moment is really

00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,640
finding out what the scope of the

00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,680
problem is we know what aware and some

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:36,220
of these advanced technologies can run

00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:40,130
on high-end $15,000 and video equipment

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:43,910
what we want to do is enable it on more

00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:47,000
our meso C's so one of the things we're

00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,860
doing is a proof-of-concept we don't

00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,260
have much resources on this we'd welcome

00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:54,920
any additional resources from members

00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:58,850
but we're going to basically use auto

00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,740
ware and Ross and other technologies

00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:02,600
that our members are interested in and

00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,160
put together a proof-of-concept that we

00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,460
hope to demonstrate to you at the next

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:11,120
connect where we hope to actually be

00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:13,430
demonstrating the results of this the

00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,520
goal of which is to create a software

00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:18,980
platform that we can use to do further

00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:26,600
work on open source software for

00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:29,420
autonomous driving ok let's switch tacks

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,730
a little bit on 296 boards the 96

00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,250
board's eco system is growing very

00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,360
rapidly

00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:38,920
unfortunately yang Zhang for

00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:43,730
or visa reasons back to geopolitics

00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:47,030
wasn't able to travel here this week but

00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:49,040
he is the director of 96 boards has been

00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:52,190
working very hard to get more and more

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,320
of the ecosystem involved and all of

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,290
these companies are either on the

00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,990
ninety-six board steering committee or

00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,820
their manufacturing 96 boards products

00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,460
and they have a manufacturing

00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,730
partnership with us some of the more

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:11,030
recent boards that you may not have seen

00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:13,790
are actually in all areas of ninety-six

00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:17,080
boards so IOT in particular

00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:19,760
ZigBee and ble boards using TI chips

00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:25,340
there are companies building lower ran

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:28,850
low rwan boards using st micros and then

00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:34,910
you see robotics has just introduced 802

00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:36,650
11 AC 2x2 Wi-Fi plus ble 5 what's really

00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:40,250
interesting about this is it's a 28

00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:42,680
nanometer chip and has a 416 megahertz

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:45,020
m4 in it so you can do some pretty

00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:49,480
powerful stuff in this and it can

00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:54,820
support a Phi of over 700 megabits and

00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:58,520
NB IOT path towards 5g is also available

00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:00,740
BPI building a product that supports

00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,440
that uses the STM see you as the

00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,390
applications processor so more and more

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,920
of the sort of standard IOT boards are

00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,950
being built on this footprint they all

00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,300
have the same expansion capability and

00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:15,530
you can use them for developing software

00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:18,050
and products see e boards from genea

00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:21,340
tech they've taken over a version of the

00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:25,870
dragon board rock chip I talked about

00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:30,530
last time these are a 72 processors for

00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:32,840
$69 runs OpenCL OpenGL and they also

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:35,060
have an AI chip in there

00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,430
hi chips and all winner are doing a far

00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,140
field development kit for building home

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:43,160
speakers and things if you want to

00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:46,160
experiment with that and in the

00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,790
enterprise space global scale using an M

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,680
star

00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:53,840
have a board that can do 4k video 4k TV

00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,170
set-top box applications for development

00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,900
of that the point is that all of these

00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:02,750
products are based on new technology

00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:06,230
they're helping us get access to new

00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:11,720
technology more easily and that helps us

00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:17,180
build better software sooner which

00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:19,550
brings me to IOT and I think of IOT is

00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,950
basically everything now everything

00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:23,810
that's not a server the reason is

00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:26,450
because every time we connect something

00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:28,580
to the Internet it's essentially an IOT

00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,050
device doesn't matter whether it's a

00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,820
wireless device doesn't matter where

00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:34,720
it's a car were connecting to the

00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:37,220
Internet we haven't done this before

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,020
historically building embedded products

00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,690
we could test that embedded product we

00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,730
could certify it we could build it and

00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,310
as long as we didn't change anything

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,540
around it unless there was a hardware

00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:51,400
failure it was going to keep doing what

00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:54,800
it was doing that isn't the case anymore

00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,470
so as we move towards the trillion

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,930
devices connected to the Internet we are

00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:02,480
going to be creating billions of edge

00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:05,230
interfaces for those of you who thought

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,050
edge is not coming for a while too late

00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:11,780
we need to think about edge computing in

00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:15,200
everything we do from an open source

00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:19,340
perspective so inland ro were working

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:21,140
across Lennar o on Io T devices in core

00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,030
engineering were building tools were

00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,609
working on security were working on

00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,070
infrastructure in a light we're working

00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:31,160
on software for very small devices with

00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:33,230
microcontrollers in allege we're looking

00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,790
at software for the edge so how do you

00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,619
deal with gateways how do you deal with

00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:39,920
multi-layer gateways how do you deal

00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:41,750
with industrial IOT and in LD CG we're

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,520
dealing actually with software for the

00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,520
data center and cloud that's going to be

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:51,580
used in all of this technology to

00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:55,750
process and interact across the planet

00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:58,640
and these devices are not mobile phones

00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,020
right they're not being replaced every

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,200
year

00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:04,870
this is infrastructure this is going

00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,490
into cities it's going into homes it's

00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:08,410
going into places where it's just going

00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:11,470
to be it's not going to be a shiny toy

00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:13,390
that you replace a year later this is

00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:17,800
something that's going to be running

00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:20,160
software for a long time talking about

00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:23,410
microcontrollers which we were earlier I

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,020
recently saw when I when I first started

00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:28,240
in this business microcontrollers were

00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:30,250
very simple recently saw a

00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,220
microcontroller with a four thousand

00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:37,390
page technical reference manual these

00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:40,810
are not simple devices there are going

00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:42,220
to be bugs spectra and meltdown was a

00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:44,170
sign of things to come

00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,030
we didn't even know they existed but

00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:48,910
they were there in an awful lot of the

00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,980
hardware that we have luckily they're

00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:53,380
very difficult to exploit but I

00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,450
guarantee you were going to find a

00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:59,080
problem in a mass deployed device at

00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:04,800
some point in the near future so we have

00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:08,170
to change the way we're doing things and

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,430
LTS I talked a little bit about this

00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:14,050
last time I'm going to talk about it

00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:16,150
again has been a really useful thing it

00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:18,190
has enabled us to isolate the kernel

00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:20,290
from the applications and to have a

00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:22,690
kernel that is stable and supported for

00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:24,850
a long period of time but what about the

00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:27,700
firmware what are we doing about that if

00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:30,040
that goes wrong and even if there's an

00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,230
LTS problem what we found with spectra

00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,970
and meltdown is if you have got a kernel

00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:36,400
that's three or four years old it's

00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:39,700
actually really hard to get those

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,280
patches back ported to three year old

00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,950
four year old software because the

00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:48,970
mechanisms for fixing it which have been

00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:51,190
done in the latest kernel they don't

00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:53,650
work in that old kernel we have to do it

00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:56,050
a different way and actually how many of

00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:58,330
us are really interested in fixing up

00:51:56,050 --> 00:52:01,540
four or five year old code well luckily

00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:04,930
some people but this isn't gonna scale

00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:07,780
and what's happening today is even if

00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:11,590
you build the LTS kernel and stabilize

00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,730
it every vendors putting their own BSP

00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:14,710
on top

00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:16,300
are they giving you the same guarantee

00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:21,340
of support as you're getting from the

00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:23,350
open source Linux community no and on

00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:25,750
top of that developer board makers put

00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:27,970
their own kernel pieces in that some

00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:29,440
product vendors end up using and then

00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:33,070
the product vendors make their changes

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:38,020
to the kernel so every kernel is

00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:40,180
different and all the testing that

00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:42,940
everybody use it does on their products

00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,800
it doesn't get back into the LTS kernel

00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,720
they just patch up what they're doing

00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,820
and they've got their product and it's

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,200
passed their tests and they go to market

00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,970
because that's the quick thing to do

00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:56,830
because they need revenue so this isn't

00:52:53,970 --> 00:53:01,510
scalable across thousands of companies

00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:04,540
building IOT products we've got

00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:07,840
fragmentation we've got a basic lack of

00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:10,750
security we've got a very high cost of

00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:13,840
maintenance all the way across the

00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:15,850
ecosystem and is it any wonder that

00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:19,810
we're filling up our houses with devices

00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:21,720
that we need a kind of IT guy to help us

00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:24,460
manage all of these devices in our house

00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:28,150
it's because we're not working in the

00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:32,110
same way with the same software it's a

00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:34,290
problem and I actually showed this slide

00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:37,590
but I didn't notice something last time

00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:41,260
this is the result you have a 2017 model

00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:43,180
mass-market car this photo was taken in

00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:45,790
that car it's an IV eye system with

00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:48,760
Bluetooth and it uses kernel version 3.1

00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:52,750
point 10 which was released in January

00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:54,340
2012 the scary thing is that this build

00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,890
they obviously know about

00:53:54,340 --> 00:54:01,750
LTS kernels this is probably built by a

00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:05,620
Tier one vendor is June the 9th 2015 in

00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:07,780
a 2017 production model car how many

00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:10,360
security bugs since this kernel was

00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:13,000
built have being found and this is

00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,230
connected to the Internet and it's going

00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,630
to be on the road for another ten years

00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:18,130
and I guarantee you that they're not

00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:21,270
going to update this kernel every time

00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,270
you take the car to the dealer

00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:27,489
this is the scale of the problem this is

00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:31,930
in a car but this applies to everything

00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:34,640
so fragmentation of platform software is

00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:37,099
dramatically reducing security it's

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,769
reducing our ability to react to

00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:43,969
applause and it's dramatically

00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:46,670
increasing lifetime costs at least we're

00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:50,719
starting to learn that OTA updates are

00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:53,059
not optional you have to be able to

00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:56,630
update the software in any product that

00:54:53,059 --> 00:55:00,039
you develop this should not be a value

00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:06,940
added feature this is fundamental or

00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:10,489
we're going to hit big big problems but

00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:13,519
think of what it means if you can update

00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:16,489
all the software on a product you don't

00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:20,690
necessarily want to do it but if you can

00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:23,869
it gives you some big opportunities now

00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:26,539
Linares mission is to collaborate in the

00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:30,289
ecosystem to accelerate the deployment

00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:32,150
of ARM based systems and yet sometimes

00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:33,829
it feels that we're all going in our own

00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:37,880
direction and we're actually achieving

00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:40,339
the opposite with good continuous

00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:43,609
integration continuous testing of small

00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:46,219
changes so every change gets tested and

00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:47,719
you can isolate when you are introducing

00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:50,989
a regression if you've got a big enough

00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:52,789
test set then the latest software is the

00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:57,319
most stable the most secure and the most

00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:59,449
functional when you buy a certain phone

00:55:57,319 --> 00:56:02,089
from a certain manufacturer two years

00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:04,400
later it's running two years later

00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:07,849
software it's a heck of a lot more

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,869
stable it's more secure and it's

00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:14,719
actually got a whole bunch of new

00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:16,459
functionality so with OTA updates if you

00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,549
buy into the fact that we've got to be

00:56:16,459 --> 00:56:21,559
able to update software in our products

00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:23,449
then rather than long-term supported

00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:25,940
kernels what if we could align on a

00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:28,249
single upstream aligned codebase and

00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:32,229
keep it always updated and always

00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:35,270
improving that is after all what we do

00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:39,240
we work in upstream

00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:42,869
we fix things we create new technology

00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:45,630
and we apply security patches first in

00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:47,490
upstream technology so why aren't we

00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:50,160
delivering it to our customers why won't

00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:52,680
they take it how do we show them that

00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,619
this is actually a better way because if

00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:58,319
we could do it then you're scaling a

00:56:55,619 --> 00:57:01,109
single codebase across multiple products

00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:03,180
and every use case every company that

00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:05,460
builds a product is making the core

00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,410
platform better yes they're putting

00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,390
their own IP on that's great

00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,339
and they'll maintain their own IP and

00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:15,690
that will be their secret source and how

00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:18,960
they create value and and and grow but

00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:22,470
if the if the platform is Linux or

00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:27,809
Zephyr or free artists or embed and it's

00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:29,849
open then we can scale out we can

00:57:27,809 --> 00:57:31,440
actually benefit from everybody's

00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:36,690
testing and the product will get better

00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:39,780
and better and better so I challenge

00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:45,299
Lennar o to try and help solve this

00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:49,290
problem I think a lot of you know that a

00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:52,559
small group in Lennar o went about a

00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:56,210
year ago and spun off a company which

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,210
was called open source foundries and

00:57:57,049 --> 00:58:03,750
it's now called foundries dot IO and

00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:06,869
Alan Bennett who many of you know was

00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:08,790
the technical leader of that team for

00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:12,510
many years and he worked inland ro for

00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:15,540
many years I think most of you know that

00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:19,410
he unexpectedly passed away about a

00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:21,329
month ago but he was a very special

00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:24,059
person to a lot of people in this room

00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:26,880
and to everybody who knew him he touched

00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:30,720
the lives of people he met he was funny

00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:33,119
he was inspirational and he was an

00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:37,109
amazing technical leader who had a

00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:39,079
passion about everything he did and so I

00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:42,299
thought it would be appropriate since

00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:47,220
you haven't seen what he and his team

00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:49,890
have been doing over the last year that

00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:53,040
in memory of Alan we showed you some of

00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:58,380
the progress that the team and the

00:58:53,040 --> 00:59:02,190
company has made so what foundries dot

00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:05,460
IO is doing is it's trying to fulfill

00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:08,550
the promise of IOT from a commercial

00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:11,609
point of view by delivering continuously

00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:14,520
updated software platforms to make a

00:59:11,609 --> 00:59:18,540
secure connected world and it's basing

00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:20,579
off Linares work we're using trusted

00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,349
firmware we're using Zephyr we're using

00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:26,400
open embedded and Yocto we're using

00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:29,550
docker so all of these technologies are

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:34,109
being used to actually create this

00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:36,180
continuously updated platform and the

00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:39,240
company's products are micro platforms

00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:42,089
they're the minimal secure software base

00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:45,839
you need to build an IOT or an edge

00:59:42,089 --> 00:59:48,390
connected device now you're not going to

00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,280
have one binary for every IOT device

00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:53,069
right the binary would be this big and

00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:57,930
the devices are this big so it's a

00:59:53,069 --> 01:00:02,010
single source code base it builds in OTA

00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:04,109
updates and security to both artists and

01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:06,180
Linux implementations and it's

01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:10,050
continuously integrated tested and

01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:13,680
updated I'm going to ask Tyler Baker

01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:16,190
whose foundries IO CTO to come up and do

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,190
a quick demonstration

01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:37,690
all right didn't hear perfect okay it's

01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:39,250
great to be back at Kinect finally see a

01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:40,930
lot of familiar faces so thanks for

01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:43,660
having me today

01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:45,130
as George mentioned I want to show you

01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:47,440
what we've been working on so I've got a

01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:50,170
few exciting demos for you hopefully

01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:53,350
you'll find them as exciting as I do so

01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:56,320
I want to talk about what makes an OTA

01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:58,030
update secure so it really it's the

01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,830
proper use of encryption digital

01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:02,500
signatures and one-way hash functions

01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:06,040
along with time stamps and a good key

01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:08,350
rotation scheme so what's really neat

01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,510
about the implementation that we put

01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:12,550
together is that your root key or any

01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:14,760
keys in your tree can be compromised and

01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:16,900
you still have a mite mitigation to

01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,560
regain control of the targets in the

01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:23,530
field so it's a very robust over-the-air

01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:25,570
update solution that we've adopted so we

01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:28,090
use the update framework slash obtain

01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:29,680
which is a specification and it's open

01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:32,200
source to implement the secure

01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,870
over-the-air updates we use OS Tree on

01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,360
the Linux micro platform to deliver a

01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:40,510
Delta based image layer and then we use

01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:42,250
you know the hashing and the digital

01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:45,580
signatures and the encryption to ensure

01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:48,640
immutability privacy and verification of

01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,380
the images so then not only do we just

01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,090
update the user space we update the

01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,800
kernel and the boot firmware as well so

01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:56,380
the entire system can be updated with

01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,240
what we built so the hardware I have in

01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:01,750
front of me here this is a Raspberry Pi

01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:04,390
3 with a 7 inch LCD IPS display and then

01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:06,700
I have an Intel x86 seller on 8 gigs of

01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:09,010
ram 500 gig solid-state drive connected

01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,540
to two 24-inch monitor now they both

01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:12,010
have these speakers that you see in

01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,240
front of them their microphone and

01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:15,190
speakers I'll get to that in a second

01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,410
but essentially they have similar

01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,850
hardware but what makes them special as

01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:23,380
they're running the exact same software

01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:24,400
build oh yes microphone you forgot my

01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,080
piece of hardware

01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,450
George built this one so I built this

01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:32,320
one this is running zephyr and has a

01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:34,420
cortex and micro and a Bluetooth yep so

01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,910
that wasn't a very powered and this one

01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:38,740
here is the exact same hardware but it's

01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:39,290
been 3d printed and has an LED ring so

01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,850
it looks more

01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,230
like a traditional light bulb of course

01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:44,030
it runs off line voltage and yours is

01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:46,910
running off five volts so gonna really

01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:49,460
roll the dice with this one okay so I

01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:52,430
have managed here and if we take a look

01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:53,210
at the Nook oh one which is the x86 box

01:02:52,430 --> 01:03:02,390
here to my left

01:02:53,210 --> 01:03:05,270
oh is the internet gone out there we go

01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:07,370
okay great so you can see hardware

01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:08,660
details IP addresses all that stuff but

01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,010
what you do if you scroll down here is

01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,410
you see that it's not running the latest

01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:14,420
software so we run build 26 we should

01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:17,120
probably move it to 27 so let's go ahead

01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:18,590
and click apply here and it says the

01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,050
device is updating so we've started the

01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:23,690
OTA update process on the nook let's go

01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:26,510
to the Raspberry Pi that I have here so

01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:29,950
it's also on 26 and if we look here you

01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,950
can see the hash and if I go

01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,420
you can see the hash that we're on right

01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:43,310
here currently there's a b7 dat would be

01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:47,030
70 80 so if we applied the update we

01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:48,290
want to move to a 64 a and so we started

01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,700
that process of both devices are

01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,710
updating right now and while they're

01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:54,500
doing that what I want to show you is a

01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:57,620
quick couple of demos so typically

01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,360
embedded use cases there's a digital

01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,800
signage use case that's that's pretty

01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,580
common so I want to show you that real

01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,600
quick so I'm gonna use docker compose

01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:12,230
let's just do this on the Raspberry Pi

01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:14,570
first I can type this morning I swear I

01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:17,000
can do it so what we're gonna see here

01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:19,280
is we're gonna run X in a container

01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,870
that's gonna drive these displays from

01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,910
within a docker container and it's also

01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:25,370
going to produce a lockdown chromium

01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:27,830
mode so if you want to display a website

01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:30,140
or a schedule at a conference this would

01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:31,520
be a use case that you'd use so the

01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:33,560
important thing to realize here is the

01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,270
same container source is used across

01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,670
platforms and it's seamless it's the

01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:39,680
same command to a user running on x86 or

01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:41,240
running on arm there is no difference I

01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,840
can't okay

01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:46,340
great they've come up so now I want to

01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:50,540
up the ante a little bit here and make

01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:52,820
this demo more complicated so I'm gonna

01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:54,440
see if our Google assistant demo is

01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:58,250
gonna work so what we have is the Google

01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:00,920
assistant running also alongside the X

01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:02,690
container talking to LeSean which is

01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,580
using LW m2m and the zephyr micro

01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,750
platform on these devices and the idea

01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:10,250
is to control it with my voice so let's

01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:17,230
see hey Google what time is it nine

01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:17,230
forty six hey Google turn it on okay

01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:23,470
yeah and then see what's going on here

01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,540
hold on a second of course this isn't

01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:26,380
this isn't a demo yeah we've lost

01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:31,020
everything

01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:34,960
no there it is hey Google turn it on

01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:38,320
okay yeah sure what's going on here

01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,390
let's move on anyways okay so we've got

01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:43,119
some problems here but if I

01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:44,920
I knew this speaker and I unmute this

01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,720
one I can do the same thing on x86 so

01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:58,810
hey Google what's the weather like in

01:05:46,720 --> 01:06:00,340
Vancouver BC well that's not a great

01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:01,480
forecast so I was hoping for better

01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,920
weather but we're just gonna have to

01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,680
deal so let's just check on her updates

01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,869
now and see if they've finished okay so

01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,240
the raspberry PI's told us that it's

01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:18,220
updated and the next on 27 so let's just

01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:20,320
check it ou s tree okay so now the image

01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:22,600
that we want to have it's we're still

01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,940
running the old image one 160 188 if we

01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,520
look back here at the Nook we can see

01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:29,530
the hash we were on one six one eight

01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,450
eight but now that we have a pending

01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:34,780
update that we need to apply which is

01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:36,070
three five eight five seven which is 27

01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:38,670
so let's go ahead and reboot both these

01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,670
devices now

01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:49,970
let's hope it was a bug in the software

01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,260
yeah let's hope so the update might so

01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:54,650
yeah kind of kind of what you've seen

01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:56,270
here is docker containers that run the

01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:58,610
same source across architecture

01:06:56,270 --> 01:07:00,890
controlling hardware driving displays

01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:02,060
driving microphones and speakers I think

01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:03,950
what's what's really neat about this

01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:06,770
demo and should it work hopefully when

01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:08,690
every boots it works fine is that it's

01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:11,750
doing a lot there's a lot of Technology

01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:13,940
going on here so we've got you know the

01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:16,610
update happening in the background we're

01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:18,950
driving a display we're taking audio

01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:21,110
samples in real time doing the language

01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:22,490
processing on the device itself sending

01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:24,230
it to the google cloud receiving an

01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:26,240
event acting on the event and actually

01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:28,280
changing light States ideally and when

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:33,500
everything works so let's just take a

01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:38,120
look here okay they're sure to come back

01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:41,410
up okay so we've got the x86 box up

01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,410
let's just do this

01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,560
and let me see when was going to come

01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,780
back up

01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:56,650
okay so what what you've kind of seen

01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:59,200
here in the okay so we've done an

01:07:56,650 --> 01:08:00,490
over-the-air updates securely and the

01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,830
applications we were running in our

01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:04,750
docker containers still function so we

01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:06,310
were able to basically isolate the user

01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:10,000
application from the base operating

01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:11,680
system which is kind of a new concept in

01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,630
embedded usually you bundle everything

01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,550
together as one monolithic image and you

01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:18,760
roll out updates to that so I think this

01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:20,049
enables you know users of the system to

01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,520
be able to deploy software kind of

01:08:20,049 --> 01:08:23,500
independently of the OS and so we can

01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,120
keep things up to date a little bit

01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,620
easier okay so we the devices have

01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,150
connected back to the Raspberry Pi as

01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:31,750
you can see here let's just try this

01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:37,900
demo one more time okay google turn it

01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:39,700
off you got it hey we're not done we're

01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,260
gonna up the ante here a little bit I

01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:44,290
told you that was a bug in the previous

01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:51,510
version maybe it works now hey Google

01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:55,150
turn it on sure hey Google make it blue

01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:57,700
okay so it parsed my voice on a

01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:59,500
Raspberry Pi and knew the color set it

01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,480
back to Google servers I received an RGB

01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,920
code and then updated the lights in a

01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:10,240
standard fashion so let's do one more

01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:12,790
demo hey Google started I found a couple

01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:15,510
places the first one is blue star motors

01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:18,220
at 13631

01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:22,240
the second one is blue sky Japanese

01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:23,260
bistro @ 18:15 thank you you guys are

01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:30,549
gonna have to try this out we need

01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:32,380
better eye hey Google started sure okay

01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:34,720
so what you're seeing here is an HSV

01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:36,250
color wheel demo so in real time in two

01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,500
different threads on the raspberry pi

01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:40,180
we're controlling the lights over lwm so

01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,549
there's a lot of stuff going on here and

01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:45,940
I can kind of explain it a little bit so

01:09:42,549 --> 01:09:47,049
what we have is DTLS securing the

01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,940
communication between the lights

01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:51,790
Bluetooth Low Energy and then 6lowpan

01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,859
running over Neath it underneath it and

01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:56,140
we're sending we're signaling this via

01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:58,240
UDP so the latency is pretty quick here

01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:01,590
now let's go back and just quickly check

01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,590
that our updates worked

01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:10,680
okay so three five eight five sevens

01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:18,600
active we've updated our operating

01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:20,580
system let's just check it over here so

01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,500
we've updated so we've updated our base

01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,030
operating systems our containers have

01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,770
maintained the same functionality and

01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:29,550
we've done this all securely so just to

01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:31,140
quickly summarize what we just saw there

01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:32,700
was a whole lot of stuff going on here

01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:34,320
Linux micro platform running across

01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:36,000
architecture you've got the Google

01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,440
embedded assistant actually running on

01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,140
the hardware not running in the cloud on

01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,060
Raspberry Pi arm 64 hardware and x86

01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,800
hardware then you've seen a secure

01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,720
over-the-air update to both of these

01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,090
devices in the field and that the

01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:50,820
applications in containers and base OS

01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:52,260
are can be updated separately and you

01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:54,210
know really to hit the point again the

01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:56,280
same software running on arm in

01:10:54,210 --> 01:11:00,260
containers and the base OS as it is on

01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,260
x86 thank you for your time

01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:11,940
thanks very much Tyler let me just see

01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:16,910
if it understands my accent should it

01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:16,910
work okay google turn it off

01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,170
okay google turn it on

01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:29,730
okay google set brightness to 10% okay

01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:36,020
Google

01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:36,020
turn it off okay Google tell me a joke

01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:51,980
okay Google tell me a joke which one

01:11:54,610 --> 01:12:04,650
okay Google tell me a joke it obviously

01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:07,810
doesn't like my accent all right

01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:13,150
so what we've actually done here is

01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:15,820
created an end-to-end platform this is

01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:17,800
tested end-to-end all of the time every

01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:20,700
single build every single change whether

01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:24,880
it's in Linux the artists the firmware

01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:31,020
the cloud is being tested on every

01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:33,550
check-in and if you think about the

01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:36,190
technology that is needed to do this

01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:41,050
end-to-end you have to do that you have

01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:44,320
to test end-to-end all the time so this

01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:46,360
is foundational software we are not in

01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:49,180
the cloud and device management business

01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:53,200
we are agnostic as to what cloud you use

01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:54,480
what you do with your data whether you

01:12:53,200 --> 01:13:00,610
use Azure or

01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:02,710
Alibaba or pelion or any cloud device

01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:04,630
management system what this is doing is

01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:07,420
simply giving product developers the

01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:09,790
ability to have a secure updatable

01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:12,900
platform for building software for their

01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:15,580
products you can try this out today on a

01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:20,550
raspberry pi a dragon board a BeagleBone

01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:23,860
black an Intel box and some others and

01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:25,720
you get a for a for a subscription you

01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:27,850
can have a personal or evaluation

01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:31,000
license that gets you every single

01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:34,600
update so you're getting continuous

01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,070
releases now as a product vendor you

01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,500
obviously don't necessarily want to

01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:40,150
update your field products every apart

01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:42,670
from anything else is expensive to do an

01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:45,520
update but you want to be able to

01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:48,630
because there is a problem you need to

01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,400
be able to react to it and deploy it

01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:53,740
immediately and of course if you have

01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:57,790
this capability you can actually deliver

01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:59,980
new functionality finally there's no

01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:02,530
lock-in this is open source technology

01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:04,600
we're building on top of so at any time

01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:06,610
you can stop some prescribing you can

01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,080
keep all of the software it's all there

01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:09,460
it's all in source code

01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,460
you've built binaries and you're doing

01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:13,600
updates you have everything you need but

01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:19,960
you will then need to provide

01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:22,650
maintenance moving forward okay so

01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,360
that's what foundries has been doing and

01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:28,990
we're very proud of what we've achieved

01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:30,640
so far watch this space we're going to

01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:32,860
continue to work very closely with

01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,170
Lennar o and depend on Lennar o moving

01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:39,300
forward

01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:41,860
so on the Lennar o side today and

01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:45,580
tomorrow and for the rest of this week

01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:47,740
we have the normal sessions and Jo will

01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,270
talk more about that every day but I did

01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:52,630
want to highlight a couple of particular

01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:54,970
things on Wednesday as Jo said we have

01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:57,100
the AI and neural networks on arm summit

01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:59,500
we have some very interesting keynotes

01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:02,350
that day from gem Davis and some

01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:05,950
speakers from Amazon and Google who I

01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:09,160
think will be very helpful in giving us

01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:10,690
additional information on what we need

01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:14,140
to do in terms of AI and machine

01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:18,130
intelligence on Thursday I'm very

01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:21,250
pleased to say that tushy yuku Shimizu

01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:24,400
from Fujitsu will be here and he's going

01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:27,190
to talk about the chip that's been

01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:29,710
developed for the post K computer and on

01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:34,830
Friday shinpei Kato of tr4 will be here

01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:38,590
and he will be talking about Auto where

01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:43,410
finally I'd like to actually make an

01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:47,650
announcement about Fujitsu silicon the

01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:51,120
a64 FX is the first processor in the

01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:54,430
world to use the arm v8 aspe

01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:57,400
architecture and it was designed to be

01:15:54,430 --> 01:16:01,480
part of the post case supercomputer

01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:04,750
project in Japan today I actually have

01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:06,550
here I think it's definitely got

01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:08,680
something to do with marketing because

01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:10,720
it doesn't have confidential and lots of

01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:14,770
numbers and things written on the on the

01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:18,430
top of the chip but this is a real chip

01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:21,740
off the fab this is a first

01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:24,050
a 64 FX chip

01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:26,270
and this is as far as I know the first

01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:31,760
time in the world this this device has

01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:36,170
been shown publicly so this is heralding

01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:39,200
a new era of arm computing this is the

01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:41,540
most powerful ARM processor that has yet

01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:44,510
been built in the world and I'm holding

01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:48,020
one so I'm really looking forward to

01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:49,280
hearing from Fujitsu on Thursday what

01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:54,170
the next steps are

01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:56,480
but the silicon is now real the goal of

01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:59,540
getting this silicon into the market

01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,550
sooner than the post que is obviously to

01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:05,180
seed the post que supercomputer

01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:08,150
ecosystem and to accelerate our ability

01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:10,550
as developers to accelerate the

01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:14,660
deployment of arm sve

01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:18,320
technology into our code bases and our

01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:20,300
tools so come back on Thursday and and

01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,760
listen more and maybe they'll have put

01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:24,530
it in something we'll have to wait and

01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,180
see but I'm really pleased that that

01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:30,370
that milestones been achieved and

01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:30,370
congratulations to to Fujitsu

01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:42,590
so as we said just to recap open source

01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:44,750
ignores boundaries and sanctions mostly

01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:47,870
there are a few security issues that we

01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:53,270
have to deal with native arm deployment

01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:58,010
is getting easier and faster an arm is

01:17:53,270 --> 01:18:01,220
now in the cloud ai hardware IP is

01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:06,080
everywhere let's make it easier to use

01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:08,360
an autonomous cars are coming with

01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,830
open-source compute but there's a lot of

01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:13,250
automotive software to do in the

01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:16,070
meantime the ninety six boards ecosystem

01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:22,580
is growing rapidly that gives us new

01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:25,600
hardware to work with upstream and LTS

01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:28,610
is still very useful in the mobile world

01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:30,320
but infrastructure and embedded products

01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:31,370
are different we're connecting them all

01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:35,030
to each other now

01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:38,570
LTS may have had its day upstream is

01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:41,540
definitely the way and finally also on

01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:42,400
the way is post que thank you for your

01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:51,100
time

01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:51,100
