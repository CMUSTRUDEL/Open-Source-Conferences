Title: YVR18-334 AI Alive: On Device and In-App
Publication date: 2018-09-28
Playlist: Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018
Description: 
	ThunderSoft has been working on AI for recent years. This presentation will share some results of AI work.  First of all, give a general introduction about the current status of AI. For the current messy AI market, whatever AI chip, algorithm, framework or application, what challenges are we facing? Then introduce what kind of services and solutions we can provide for resolving some real issues such as defects inspection in industrial and meanwhile, show the architecture of our AI system. Finally, give some use cases for your reference which focus on some details about three products(Thunder Visual Inspection, Face SDK,  and AI Kit) which are based on ML/DL technology.  For Thunder Visual Inspection, will give a solution to resolve visual inspection issues through combining deep learning, image processing, even if other computer vision related technologies together. For face SDK, will show the software architecture and interfaces. This part will take a deep dive into how to build face SDK and implement the integration of algorithms and AI models on top of some existed AI Engine(SNPE, Tensorflow Lite etc.).  AI development Kit based on Qualcomm SDM845 is extremely powerful for AI development.  In this part,  hardware specification and software capability will be listed.

[Music]

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,740
please welcome show young from Thunder

00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,740
soft

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,360
[Music]

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:39,090
yes unders of actually veer has been

00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:41,949
working for recent years so because of

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:48,460
the limitation of time I will ignore the

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:55,410
introduction of tunnels of we were first

00:00:48,460 --> 00:01:01,199
on the market and technology and some

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,199
specific user keys inside of here

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:12,570
yeah actually actually we are facing the

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,290
current state resolve the mess in the

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:22,410
world ova I tell a lot of g1 or the

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:29,250
provider some STK I mean the EA in first

00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:32,580
NJ like ho-hum has snappy high silicon

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:37,470
also their own SDK and there are a lot

00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:41,820
of free worker and the new neural

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,930
network model such as the coffee -

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,330
things are afloat

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:53,149
this is popular so actually for example

00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:57,240
if we want to if you have a application

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:59,610
running on home program platform snappy

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,440
if you want to port to another platform

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:09,330
I think it is very hard because it is

00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:12,180
the platform dependent so even Duke

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:17,489
Ohama already has a new neural network

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:20,880
conversion tool to help you do this kind

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:28,080
of conversion is do harder for

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:30,870
developers actually we want we want we

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,959
want a open standard can cover these

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:43,140
kind of gaps Dustin in the previous

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:47,100
session like how we can provide this

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:54,630
kind of layer to connect chip change AFM

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:56,820
work and the computing library actually

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:02,120
force on the soft actually we don't care

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:06,720
about it is to kind of air from work and

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,940
computer computer library because this

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:24,420
is the watch as a lack of home and

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:26,130
Google - yeah where I will even now in

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,230
the complexity yeah you can system

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,670
actually you know there are lots of

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:35,910
original provider and there are also

00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:43,110
newer processor providers they also have

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:45,739
some have a module provider actually

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,020
what do we need to do is that we need to

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:52,080
combine some modules together and the

00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:58,470
provider in this window or ng to cloud

00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:01,560
solution to so the real problems so with

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,900
the fun our solution this is a basic our

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,180
solution architecture does the I

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:12,720
mentioned program already provided

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:19,260
SDK based on MP year Halloween

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:23,610
acceleration unit and we we are focusing

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:28,710
on the implementation of algorithm we

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:31,860
are frosting on the application so we

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:36,650
provide like face recognition or someone

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,650
checking our desirable to our customer

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:46,680
on top of this kind of solution

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,260
architecture we have lots teams we can

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:56,460
do like a algorithm governments and yeah

00:04:51,260 --> 00:05:01,620
algorithm based optimization and genu we

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:07,800
also provided a I computer module such

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:12,210
as the Kokomo STR made 45066 T we also

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:16,610
provided a solution for industro that

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,610
smarts ratio and the smarts manifest

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:25,300
we also provide some savage Outlands

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,289
yeah this kind of all German also my

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,659
business on home platform actually is

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:36,909
SMP year and the tips you enabled in a

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:41,349
volume a supported like object detection

00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:47,080
and this is recognition Korean casual

00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:50,110
interest and the face recognition this

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:55,659
all of them are based on Kokomo Ison PE

00:05:50,110 --> 00:06:00,550
and APU we also provided this year

00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:03,639
solution especially in the industry such

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,000
as power line for inspection and the LCD

00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:11,259
displays pension and x-ray inspection

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:20,080
for industry and future self checkouts

00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:24,159
for for consumer market so I will give

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,060
three examples to help you get a better

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:32,169
understanding of our edification firstly

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,240
a kid why we need a heater actually

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:38,800
al-qaeda can be used before

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,529
many areas like us much robots similar

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,449
cars the mother factory and samatha

00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:49,569
ratio because this kid how powerful

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:52,029
Halliwell capability and reaches of the

00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:54,880
real function empties okay let's take a

00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:57,610
look at the hardware and software

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,810
specification you know diesel creature

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,969
is based on columns

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:09,509
STM default file which is a high end

00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:15,729
processor with powerful with powerful

00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:17,380
different new capabilities we provide

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:21,940
the Android and the Linux operating

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:24,740
system support I say paneer computing

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:30,380
library already already integrity

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:34,150
into our platform and we also put some

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:38,240
more default applications into the

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:42,560
system there is a natural admitting

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:48,699
theory that we provided a tool which is

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,699
a web web-based programming interface

00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:55,520
actually it is very easy for for

00:07:51,259 --> 00:08:00,430
developer to do a program you whatever

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,430
you have was drawn here knowledge or not

00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:10,250
yet here is the about the potential

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:15,500
market comparator here you can see the

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:20,139
computing performance actually we we

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,139
have much faster than the other two

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:32,300
yeah we we also have some contacts and

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,440
entities around the react it if we want

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:39,680
to get more information you can assist

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:43,940
30 W dot 45 smarter come ok so more

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,720
information I will be used three use

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,209
pieces about how to use our kids to

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,149
build in our solution the first things

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:56,270
about whom was surveilling the solution

00:08:53,149 --> 00:09:00,410
actually you use Sangha come here kids

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:03,890
and it W as can see is the video

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:08,110
streaming you can do the pet monitor or

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:13,100
baby monitor or some stranger detection

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:15,829
and the second the second day is about

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,860
its material solution actually you can

00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:22,970
use our cater to and this is a broad

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:25,610
traffic hit Meru optimizes that the

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:29,959
placement of wood and you how to use

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:33,640
this year key to do the facility

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:37,060
recognition and the recognition

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:42,579
you also can use it our eco always

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:48,279
remember to do a lot of related physical

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:52,300
relation and detection you also can do

00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:57,959
the you also can duplicate it is kind of

00:09:52,300 --> 00:10:01,120
solution to another retail market but

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,850
the third is about industry inspiration

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:10,870
solution actually there are a lot of

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:13,120
elements from the industry the Hindu

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,740
Zotero treatise that

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:22,060
yeah the tell she was self lending

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:25,589
Whedon inspection system to to beat his

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:31,000
ass element is a requirement and

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:34,329
metallurgy can increase speed accuracy

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,430
and the consistence of did health of the

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:42,730
identification I will give you some

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:46,149
details about the inspection solution

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:52,620
because currently we have some projects

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:52,620
about this industry is inspection

00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:01,000
actually what is the Chandra vision

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:03,430
inspection reading especially is based

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,709
on machine learning deep learning

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:13,540
algorithm we used some image processing

00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:16,899
and other computing vision technology to

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:23,920
to build our machine vision inspection

00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:26,440
application this is the basic

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,970
intelligence region is version working

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:33,880
up for principle there are two steps the

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:37,990
first way is training step absolutely we

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:40,920
get some more normal image or animal

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,910
image and we can

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:48,809
make a deep lending network model by

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:51,829
training this kind of data and then we

00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:55,309
pull some image into this kind of

00:11:51,829 --> 00:12:01,319
different network model we can created

00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:07,769
we can identify the image which is okay

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:10,259
which is not okay compared to the

00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:14,309
transitional machine reading actually

00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:18,959
there are lots of advantage because it

00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:23,850
is a self lending system or we can uses

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,259
a different stage like a study some

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,929
simple feature the studies that

00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,929
complexity the features and the make

00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:35,999
some training classifier to cater to

00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:38,249
create output this is the coal reserves

00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:42,199
the first step is detailed

00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:45,470
classification and to stage the defect

00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:50,299
detection and the segmentation and the

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:54,679
first ever is normally diversity

00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:56,879
detection this is a lot how to implement

00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,290
this kind of solution

00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:04,999
the first therapy is connect clear to a

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:10,339
few simple images and put them into

00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:13,819
cloud or server and training and to the

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:16,290
verification and we download the

00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:20,279
algorithm when do some training dirty to

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:22,649
the protocol on so we can use the

00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:27,949
training data and our inspection in

00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:27,949
order to do the inspection

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:39,540
this is the basic system technology

00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:42,670
allocator actually there are also two

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,699
later that the low leader is the based

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:49,509
on the image processing and inspection

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:53,860
algorithm the up there is about 18 new

00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:57,790
image hynnyín we can create different

00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:02,529
nutria new network model and use this

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:07,300
model to pull some data and the

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:10,749
indicators create create the output the

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:13,300
last one is about fishes Tiki actually

00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:17,860
in the market there are a lot of SDK

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:22,300
provided by algorithm provider or some

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:25,300
other providers are wasting here this is

00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:28,509
our SDKs the basic architecture actually

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:33,430
CCSD is the high performance material

00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:38,110
adapter layer padam platform oh yeah we

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:40,089
provide a lot of abilities such as the

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,089
face detection and the physical nation

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:46,290
age and general emotion detection and

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,290
eyes blink wrong

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:58,490
this is about the SDKs internal elektra

00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:03,740
actually the face SDK is the interface

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:05,870
to a 50-piece 50 engine is responsible

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,240
for the algorithm scheduling and real

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:12,490
management and user amendment and the

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,870
barber amendment to each other of the

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:19,430
peripheral cream management including

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:22,490
the buffered creation and destroy the

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:25,010
user amendment tutor of the user and the

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:29,320
feast library amendment a loading and

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:32,600
the destroy every is the most important

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,340
component is all original context

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,980
actually arbitrary their own context

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:42,880
manager the over a ceremony environment

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:46,400
and some mineral results and data

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,610
compositing organism of context exists

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:55,700
in the whole lifecycle of the algorithm

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:59,360
and another part is over the rapper when

00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:04,250
Prabir did unify the always Rama

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:07,010
interface by encapsulating different

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,350
algorithms you will create a unified the

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:13,400
interface you don't care about it slowly

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:18,830
so that the implementation of a

00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:21,050
low-level the last part is the year

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:25,280
engineer and the platform with every

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:29,900
actually we provide Android and Linux

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:34,670
the policy we provide Simek and NDP to

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:38,240
do the compilation we also provide the

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:45,590
platform independent interface for up

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:51,620
there this is the example about how to

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:55,290
use our SDK to do the fish image at the

00:16:51,620 --> 00:17:00,630
you can take a look at this is cool

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:04,230
the first of that we did the new CC

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:07,280
image and the state is a model house and

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:10,560
then we get some mode of some more

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,870
features and if we want to use this

00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,620
feature if you want to use facial

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:24,810
recognition you can pass some parameter

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:27,440
to the low level implementation okay

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:33,380
this is all about today's presentation

00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:38,559
thank you for your time and the question

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,559
[Applause]

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:51,200
I have one question about your IR kit so

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:54,800
there's a CPU it cocom 8 4 5 right yeah

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,630
it's a file okay so is it public

00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,520
available now for purchasing or usage

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:05,800
actually contrary the Holloway is

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,510
already holoband so they are already but

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:13,690
I'm not sure whether you can buy from

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:20,870
outside you have assessed how do you

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:23,590
w-w-w dot so far away I will come but

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:29,120
actually we have encountered during

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:31,280
September if you get it if if you join

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,440
the context maybe you have opportunity

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:42,520
to get a deal kind of okay thank you

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:50,720
yeah you had the slide with the link

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:54,020
yeah I only I only have the contacts

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,880
being that yeah the beginning there was

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,880
one slide with the link to the contest

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,010
yeah this yes yeah yeah yeah take a

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,010
picture yeah and submit

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:25,570
okay okay okay any other question okay

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,570
thank you very much okay thank you

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,209
