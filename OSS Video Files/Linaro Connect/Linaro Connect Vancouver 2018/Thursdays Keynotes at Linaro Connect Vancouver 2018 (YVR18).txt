	00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:19,009
good morning everyone my name is this is

00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,860
tsuki Shimizu I'm in charge of system

00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:25,790
development for Fujitsu supercomputer

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:32,230
I'm here to talk to you about our new

00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:36,680
CPU the recent announced a 16 for FX and

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:39,430
my view of our HTC ecosystem potential

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,790
which will be complemented and

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:53,600
accelerated by our education for FX

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:58,790
let's go over the agenda to start with

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,719
our Java an arm world background then

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:05,890
I'll explain my understanding of the arm

00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:10,969
sve specification and its effectiveness

00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:13,639
third I'll introduce a 16-4 FX and

00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:16,749
finally I discussed the arm HPC

00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:23,810
ecosystem future and our work with our

00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:27,109
partners as you know arm has been

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:32,389
growing dramatically from IOT devices

00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:36,350
mobile homes and more this growth is not

00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:40,609
only in Korea but also in software and

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:44,709
services you all here are working hard

00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:50,810
to make the arm ecosystem Raja and Raja

00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:54,700
and by doing so it has also been growing

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:58,819
rapidly in system software and

00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:04,119
applications however there is an area

00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:04,119
which is currently not workable

00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:13,700
high-performance servers the market is

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:16,910
huge on growing rapidly with newly

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,590
developed technology like artificial

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:24,530
intelligence

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:29,150
you should expand our products and

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:33,690
technology in order to further develop

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:40,260
technology and ecosystem announced last

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:47,540
year invented a new arm to reach into

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:54,030
that market our sve scalable vector

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:57,270
extension MSV is a really powerful I say

00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,440
instructions to architecture which will

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:06,050
expand the arm world into the hyper

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:11,850
misawa's by promising compatibility and

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:17,280
long lasting support this cooperatively

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:25,230
worked with arm as a real partner in

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:30,630
that development here is an arm sve

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:34,940
features as these supports wide simile

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:40,590
for both floating-point and integer

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:46,440
various data type of data and operations

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:51,000
are supported this is effective to

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:55,500
increase the completion performance for

00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,239
the current applications and also for

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:04,830
new emerging applications very long

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:09,959
simply with vector links agnostic or be

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:15,150
a sharable compatibility among platforms

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:23,910
and generations this means that we can

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:27,840
use this is a for many years our sve

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:32,310
is encouraging us to view the

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:37,880
high-performance Ava's I'm to view the

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:40,639
software on applications on them

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:45,030
supportive assertive specific

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:51,139
specification defined by vintano this

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:57,200
community also we support the movement

00:04:51,139 --> 00:05:00,620
this BSA and svv are allow us to assure

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:06,840
compatibility of system software and

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:11,520
sequences among platforms I've read that

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:17,900
we are ready to build the locus to

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,900
explore undiscovered planets or markets

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:31,139
this is a venerable to discover these

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:35,360
new products 16 for FX now I'll show our

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:38,910
approach or our goals and technics

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,240
technologies and specifications I'll

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:47,870
also touch on the new interconnect in 12

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,870
interconnected II and Bahamas results

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:57,150
this is our approach to design

00:05:51,479 --> 00:06:00,780
undeveloped the edge so 64 FX we decided

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:04,740
to develop an original CPU core by

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:09,419
ourselves to utilize our long experience

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:12,450
of CPU development floating-point

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,940
calculation performance memory violence

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:18,889
and power consumption should be

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:23,340
optimized for high performance servers

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:28,220
all of these performance parameters are

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,980
very important and should not be

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,920
compromised

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,800
especially for the performance of real

00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,590
application running on the

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,490
high-performance Ava's the balance of

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:46,780
the calculations and boundaries is very

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:51,220
important we should keep the balance the

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:57,340
same as our predecessors this is our

00:06:51,220 --> 00:07:01,110
promise in addition to this scalability

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:05,290
in both performance and calculations

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:10,180
configurations is also important for a

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:15,060
super large system like post scale in

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:20,110
order to use a wider application area

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:26,520
the age 16 for FX also supports new

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:30,580
functions F is 16 on integer functions

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:39,070
again our sve

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:42,520
is a meets our recurrence parallel this

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:48,070
has developed and provided super

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:53,260
computer capable CPU for years the cpus

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,790
are used for computer digital prime H

00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:04,060
pcs or computers

00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:09,540
f x 10 + FX 116 for FX will be used for

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:13,090
post que the performance of the CPU

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:17,320
increased along with generations of

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:22,290
silicon technology to keep pace with

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:28,590
bahamas improvements we invented and

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,590
integrated the technologies for each CPU

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,720
for the a succeed for FX we employed a

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:44,180
three-wide simply to increase the core

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:49,490
performance to increase the number of

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:52,779
course we improved the CMG or core

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,930
memory group scale scalable architecture

00:08:52,779 --> 00:09:02,839
and in order to increase memory

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:07,339
bandwidth we utilizes hvm tool by using

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:12,399
these technologies we made our promises

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:18,970
of reality we keep the by 12 rope around

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,970
point for 1.5 through the generations

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:31,430
this figure shows the coop experiments

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:35,240
of the age 64 x FX by utilizing two

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:39,410
pipelines of the 512 with symmetry and

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,160
our micro architecture optimization the

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:46,910
core performance achieves this superior

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:51,250
throughput new integrated integer

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,250
function also works well

00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:01,830
this shows the cheap scale integration

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:07,270
using poor memory group architecture a

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:12,760
16-4 FX integrates 12 computer cords and

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:16,780
one assistant one l3 cache and dedicated

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:21,970
memory controller into the CMG into a

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:25,540
CMG this tightly coupled quads and other

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:33,250
components keeps the poor learning

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:37,270
Braille achieve integration level for

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:41,530
CMG's one interconnect controller and

00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:46,270
i/o controller are connected by the

00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:51,640
network on chip these components share

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:56,470
all memory and coherency is also kept by

00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:00,630
on chip directory if you bind the

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:05,290
threads in a process within the CMG

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:08,850
linnaeus field up to 48 computer codes

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,850
can be achieved

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:19,780
this figure shows how high bandwidth is

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:26,220
implement throughout the chip from

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:31,120
memory to calculation units this

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:37,150
uncompromised bandwidth lead hi dear

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:43,300
application performance each VM to

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:48,580
support 256 gigabyte per chip and ultra

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:52,200
cash support 3.46

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:56,220
terabyte per second so these high

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:59,190
bandwidth is realized through outer chip

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:08,080
this is very important for the real

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:10,900
application performance to achieve high

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:15,700
scalability in both system size and

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:21,190
performance top interconnected D is also

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:28,480
integrated in a 64 FX we increase the

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:32,010
number of TN eyes or DMA engines this

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,520
achieves high injection bandwidth on

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:40,180
flexible communication patterns the

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,440
barrier resources were also increased to

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:47,950
allow flexible Corrections collective

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:51,750
communication algorithms to reduce the

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:54,730
communication latency we optimize the

00:12:51,750 --> 00:13:00,220
direct descriptor and cash injection

00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:02,970
technology the hormones measurements are

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,970
shown here

00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:18,209
this shows primitive Tamas results on HP

00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:25,139
xian AI benchmarks bus are normalized by

00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:29,869
our previous review sparc64 even FX you

00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:36,419
can see it's over 2.5 times faster than

00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:40,229
our previous CPU at all benchmarks these

00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:44,819
results are achieved by the combination

00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:51,089
of our sve I say Fujitsu's micro picture

00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:56,929
and high bandwidth the contribution is

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:56,929
related to these benchmarks

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:12,519
this is the summary of a 16-4 affects

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:15,610
its support our sve and achieve superior

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,250
peak performance in both calculation and

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:21,850
Barnabas

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:26,740
it shows high efficiency on both HPC and

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:30,870
AI benchmarks in the following sections

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:33,910
I will show our work with partners the

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:40,300
system development software development

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:43,120
and cooperation with high speed ok as

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,600
you may know this is currently

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,860
developing hosk a successor to a

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:56,440
computer with written post scale will be

00:14:50,860 --> 00:15:02,380
available around 2021 as I announced the

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:07,720
decision post conceived or a successful

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:10,980
FX was powered on successful and now OS

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,529
is running and the simplification is

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:17,440
underway as scheduled

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:21,070
we can also announced the post kre

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:28,180
access program which will start around

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:32,519
second quarter of year 2020 here this is

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,519
a post game prototype lock

00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,240
okay

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,630
this is a system software stack written

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:51,950
on the fugitive are developing for

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:57,130
Pascal Green pod is developed by Rican

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,130
and others are the work by fugitive

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:07,130
little comparison libraries are

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:13,130
optimized for a successful FX micro

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:17,839
picture and they maximize sve and hvm to

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:26,089
performance digital also works in

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:29,270
conjunction with many partners here are

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:38,560
the main players who will build the arm

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:43,310
HPC ecosystem nano Europe and open TPC

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:47,240
working for the arm HPC ecosystem Vegeta

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:54,980
is also working as a member of these

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:58,459
communities or as a partner these are

00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:04,670
ranana HPC goals and objective and

00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:09,949
derivatives Fujitsu members are working

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:16,569
in this groups and contributing I

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:22,120
believe that babies and Misaki the

00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:27,050
develops two major comparisons and

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:30,040
quality and received notable acai award

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,040
this spring

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:41,330
this is a hard run for application

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:47,840
posing and a variation we are now in the

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:55,030
middle of steps 2 & 3 we just average

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,030
the application on thunder x 2 and x 86

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:10,400
so we are going to the SV evaluation and

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:15,350
is V cooperation here is a list of all

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:22,070
races we are working on at arm HPC users

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:25,570
group under registers we were able to

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:30,140
run many combinations of compilers and

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:42,340
applications are successful we are still

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:42,340
working around here but complete Capri

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:54,460
this is one of the results of OSS

00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:58,660
application porting an evaluation what

00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:04,100
wrf is a very famous methodological

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:09,650
application we evaluated off using the

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:19,340
condition here and here and on Thunder

00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:24,730
x2 and sky rake and Luis you can see

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:29,750
that high memory boundaries of Sunda x2

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:37,520
multiple homes that Skydeck the same

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:40,210
condition and low vicinity arrows better

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,210
performance

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:52,090
these results encourage us anika think

00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:58,840
that higher bandwidth and long facility

00:19:52,090 --> 00:20:01,590
of a success 16 for FX or arm SPE would

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,590
perform better

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:15,600
so in summary of my presentation today

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:21,090
our sve has opened the doors for arm

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,090
ecosystem in high-performance servers

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:32,440
Fujitsu developed a 16-4 FX are the

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:37,140
first implementation of the our sve it

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,990
would perform in verse HPC and air

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:47,309
applications

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:51,340
Posca will use a 16 for FX will achieve

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:56,890
100 old application performance of care

00:20:51,340 --> 00:21:02,710
computer Fujitsu will continue to work

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:09,420
with our partners for arm ecosystem from

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:09,420
the HPC area thank you very much

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,880
Shimizu son thank you so much for

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,440
joining us this morning and sharing that

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,510
with us you know the movement of a arm

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,760
of supercomputers is really going to

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,020
mainstream supercomputers all over the

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,020
world there are so many different

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,370
applications for the use of this and I

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,740
think we'll see them proliferate

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,080
everywhere as a result to work like the

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:42,870
work that fugitive is doing any

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,890
questions this morning anyone so I just

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,669
don't want to know

00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:49,380
for each EMC it has a certain chorus

00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:52,919
water certain colors are symmetrical or

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,620
not sorry what is that equal the certain

00:21:52,919 --> 00:22:01,679
chorus in CMG is a symmetrical or not

00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:04,470
and why it is to have chorus with one

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:09,299
assist Nicole how to watch the special

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:10,429
consideration for ease okay so wait a

00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,429
moment please

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,429
okay

00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,200
okay

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,200
Oh

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,710
okay

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:42,230
so your question is I said that the 12

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:49,070
computer core on system one assistant or

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:52,010
so you symmetry so so all the sudden

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:57,340
cores are you verbally the same or not

00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:01,340
same same course you can learn the

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:12,190
original or ordinary program on the

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:14,330
assistant cord also the same core why

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,370
rare are 13 course

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:20,330
what's the special consideration to

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:23,659
define the the 13 colors for cash

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:27,700
currency or four panelists and in

00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:32,659
special consideration for is so the

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:37,690
Bahamas should be considered for the bus

00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:41,659
bandwidth and number of course but it is

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:44,210
yeah that's it so we compare the

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:47,840
boundaries of the bus and the number of

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:51,260
course we provide enough advantages for

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:57,260
each course so the number of cores is

00:23:51,260 --> 00:24:00,409
very limited another question anybody so

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:04,010
you can actually see the first iteration

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:06,860
in real life of post K after the break

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,539
today next to the Marvel Thunder X 2

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:14,779
workstation Shimizu son thank you so

00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:16,760
much for joining us here - ok and now

00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:18,740
I'd like to introduce long Wang who will

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,080
tell us talk to us about smart compete

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,540
smart communities yes please join me in

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:29,260
welcoming long

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:29,260
[Applause]

00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:36,440
hello everyone I'm a long one for my uni

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:39,529
sock uni Sokka the second largest

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,059
semiconductor in China today we're

00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:44,750
talking about smart community remember

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:46,549
status in China schmuck company no

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,860
longer the buzzy world actually occur

00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:50,899
around the globe as we speak but they

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,460
were sure what happen in China what time

00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:55,250
challenge you are facing with deploy a

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,919
smart device in the home community city

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:02,120
and some resolution to address those

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,490
challenge our China the Builder have had

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,769
to bidding over to building a square

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,809
meter of the flow space per year which

00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:11,750
account for 50% of the new home

00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:14,029
construction around the world so their

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,830
real estate developer in China are

00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:18,679
motivated to pre install the smart

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,809
device and the small price as a standard

00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,299
product to give them a competition at

00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:24,919
the bandage over comparator more

00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,289
important to let people live better

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,960
for example the Chandler country garden

00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:32,480
which is a largest real estate developer

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,720
in China have there were over 600 smart

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,029
community since April 2016 they're

00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,970
working with a 40 partner install over

00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:44,720
1,000 the different type of the some

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:48,080
advice in the home here are some example

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,549
we can see this one of him Guangzhou

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:55,580
this one in widow this one is in cinder

00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:58,039
and this one is in Malaysia so we also

00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,779
have video crepe to show what kind of my

00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:03,970
community they are developing right now

00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:03,970
so let's show the video crepe

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,769
[Music]

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,940
[Music]

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:42,669

00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:56,869
[Music]

00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:42,450

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:24,940
[Applause]

00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:24,940
[Music]

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,690

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:29,810
[Music]

00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:41,300
Asuka is peaceably bring out of the

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:47,840
security convenience and wisdom for life

00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:47,840
that you enjoy small life to aid are you

00:31:53,129 --> 00:32:00,639
okay so I seen this video clip show

00:31:57,699 --> 00:32:02,259
give us some idea first of all less

00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:04,929
looking lachemann city because my

00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:08,279
community the part of our city here is

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:11,739
Sh'ma city avocation and the platform

00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,729
china polls or the leadership role in

00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:18,219
schmancy city technology development as

00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:20,229
rural to urban migration so china have a

00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:23,349
highest number of the Smurfs a pilot

00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:24,699
project right now there's over 1,000 my

00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:26,440
city pilot project

00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:28,509
really for and the construction

00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,779
worldwide and the china is a home to

00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:33,879
proxy proximity of 500 of them take my

00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:35,799
example you know the massive

00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:37,959
installation of the civilian camera

00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:41,499
system with advanced facial recognition

00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:44,229
technology can really ask an entire

00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:46,779
China population on top of the one for

00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:49,179
three billion people witness again it

00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:51,029
helped police to crack down on the

00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:53,979
criminal and they improve the security

00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:56,019
you have been China you should be aware

00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:58,449
that you can win the wrong at midnight

00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:01,269
in the downtown some big city like

00:32:58,449 --> 00:33:05,469
Beijing Shanghai or Chandon with

00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:08,169
assurance of being safe and the song on

00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:10,629
the flipside security and privacy

00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:12,429
protection that always always connect

00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:15,699
and the key area to deliver the quality

00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:17,649
of experience so you do on the official

00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:20,289
data in the system to be kept safe and

00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:23,649
with the Stricker common oversight to

00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:29,169
prevent any unauthorized use or

00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:31,929
interception then we'll move to small

00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:33,549
community so from the video tips video

00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:36,309
clip will show the before you can see

00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:39,119
the noodles Mac immediately connect

00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:44,079
order is like electricity water

00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:46,479
air-conditioned elevator or this garage

00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,489
the community gate and with the system

00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:50,019
all the thing together so they can

00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:52,329
manage your entire community more

00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:57,009
effective more efficiently and more

00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:59,140
safely but how to protect privacy

00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:02,500
enhance security and

00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:07,480
maintenance and operation Koslow will be

00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:09,340
a major challenge here's some typical

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,139
home with all the smart device

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:17,740
installation like the air purify the

00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:20,050
water purify the smart lock the water

00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:24,340
leak detection guests the leak detection

00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:27,450
of this window control windows sensor

00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:30,250
curtain controller so if Adama if I have

00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:34,480
any the water leak or gas leak in the

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:36,369
home this is water the sensor or the gas

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,429
sensor they can't attack and a report

00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:42,429
the issue and they can remove shut down

00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:49,119
the water or gas if there any leaking in

00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:51,909
there so here is looking under the

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,550
solution double view from the smart

00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:56,830
device to get away to cloud and the two

00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,630
service provider but there are many

00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:01,000
challenge between them but they will

00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,790
focus more on their device to the cat

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,400
way because as a chip render the the

00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:10,300
device and the cat away over the ease of

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,430
the brand about her the most of this

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,080
device a war is a connect to the Gateway

00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,060
there are many different awards

00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,470
technology in the home like the Wi-Fi

00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:23,020
Bluetooth SIG B&B IOT but Wi-Fi actually

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:25,000
dominated home the body's connection and

00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,850
also we believe that would be the case

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,150
impossible the feature so today we were

00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:33,070
focused on more on the using of Wi-Fi at

00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:36,090
example to talk through lows a challenge

00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:39,040
between the device and getaway

00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,430
so looking on the Challenger side so

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,109
first always a coverage challenge I

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,300
think everybody experience you have to

00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:48,369
Wi-Fi some beds in your home like your

00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,660
laundry room your kitchen or your

00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:52,060
backyard you don't have better

00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:56,590
connection or the crappy connection so

00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:59,320
you suffer all this issue and you know

00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,850
those most of those are smart device or

00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,800
IOT device they don't have user

00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:06,150
interface you cannot input the SSID

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,520
password so how to set up those device

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:13,000
would be a key challenge here

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,770
and we we also need update those divided

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,060
from time to time to address any

00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:22,690
security hole and also the fix the issue

00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:27,280
so continuous former OTA update is a

00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:29,740
critical and once the device have the

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,450
trouble or you'll run into issue you

00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,040
want to remove the diagnostic those

00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:37,030
device indeed I was sending the service

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,970
people to the home for the children that

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:41,410
also suffer the the the fragmentation on

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,410
the ecosystem and the lack of

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:48,250
standardization there are many different

00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:50,950
cloud and our host in here like the

00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:53,350
Alibaba cloud and by the cloud Amazon

00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:56,500
Cloud and you have the different our

00:36:53,350 --> 00:37:00,940
house there's and bad there's alley

00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:02,770
scenes and everybody would prefer using

00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,170
their own OS like Alibaba they might

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:07,480
prefer using the a leasing the worse and

00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:10,090
bad crowd may prefer using and better or

00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,330
worse so as chief Lando had to provide a

00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,950
different flavor the former to support

00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:21,880
different OS in order to fit in there

00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:25,000
there are ecosystem okay so now turn to

00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:28,540
some resolution to those challenge we

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,520
using Wi-Fi extending here so we said

00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,369
there's no user interface so how to

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,410
connect this device to the cat way they

00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:37,150
they have that there appears before but

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,450
that appears we know they have a lot of

00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:43,210
security hole in the WPS so Wi-Fi

00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,820
Alliance replaced that appears this is

00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:48,100
the configure or called DPP device

00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,960
provision of protocol we can use in

00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,609
smartphone to the to scan then you can

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,980
connect this using your smartphone to

00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:56,290
scan the barcode on the excess power in

00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,770
the first to attach the network then you

00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:01,990
use in the your phone to scan the device

00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:06,609
to the provisioning after this to scan

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:11,200
the device can connect to ap security as

00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:14,290
soft connection issue the second is soft

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,420
recovery issue so we know the most home

00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,850
especially in the US or Canada the

00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,950
single family home the AP is not enough

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:23,859
so we need a multiple AP

00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:27,250
and in order to row me and hand our data

00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:29,260
between those APU your prefer to use a

00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,240
mash if you search a Google there are

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,670
many different a match solution there

00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,910
like the Google home like some stop

00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:39,790
company like gyro or prom but all this

00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,380
maximization as a profit orientation so

00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,630
they can now work in each other you have

00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,060
to buy the same device from the same

00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,040
vendor so that the burfi the created

00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,960
this using match program that allow the

00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,390
module AP from different Amanda

00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,829
interrupts with each other and you don't

00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,359
have to change the device you don't have

00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:57,040
to changes underline the hardware you

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,380
don't have to change a player the

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:05,829
application with the treasure soft issue

00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:08,170
in the 2.5 layer they also have this

00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:12,250
cost home design program what that mean

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,869
is if you need a multiple AP the they

00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,349
were based on the home sites your flow

00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:19,180
plan the based on the hominid occupant

00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:22,690
in the home and the desired the

00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:25,690
bandwidth for everybody and you design

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:28,599
the desired performance and the latency

00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:31,540
so you can decide how much ap you need

00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,030
and the word you put of those AP after

00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:36,640
this design down they have the tool to

00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:38,650
generally map the he map based on this

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,990
ap and follow planned agenda he map to

00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,089
show you to can visualize the Wi-Fi

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,470
signal in your home so the green means

00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:48,550
everything is above your desire

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,280
performance and the latency and the

00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:53,500
through hood the yellow means you're at

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,250
the edge of that red means you're below

00:39:53,500 --> 00:40:00,099
so if the rather have the re Risha for

00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:02,800
your a plea installation or you add more

00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:05,319
AP so that's make sure you have the best

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:12,460
coverage in your every corner your home

00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:15,099
and also your backyard now the there is

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,930
removed a gnostic you don't want to send

00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:18,940
a separate people to home to look into

00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,650
the issue if you run into any other

00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,349
connection issue or the connection loss

00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:26,260
so Wi-Fi data animun is a set of

00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:28,180
standards data model focus our keeper

00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,329
from the indicator so once I cracked

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,789
least

00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:34,309
this data you're able to remote

00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:39,380
diagnostic to see what happened in there

00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:42,079
you can reduce matinee sir costs also a

00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,660
union sock is working on a stand working

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,869
with standard body by fire lines and

00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:50,089
China Real Estate Association and also

00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:54,499
the home appliance vendor like the

00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:56,509
higher made Mady to try to develop our

00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:59,029
China smart homes the division program

00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:00,709
so certain law so we talk about the lack

00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:05,209
of standardization so we try to create a

00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:06,799
China the own vacation program to make

00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:10,969
sure this smart community the

00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:12,739
development is unified there are well we

00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,660
said there is over to building the

00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:17,119
square meter of the front space this

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:20,660
account is converted to admitting your

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:25,279
home per year so it's a lot of business

00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:28,430
opportunity in here okay so as you nice

00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:31,869
art so we also try to provide our own

00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:35,479
solution to help on this development

00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:40,369
that we have the few thing to introduce

00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:45,849
here right first one is this is what we

00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:49,309
have the demo in the open our this is

00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:51,949
uwp five six one we're working with you

00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:55,430
u.s. robotics to create a 96 ball on

00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:58,549
this chip is to buy suppose a 2x2 LLC

00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:01,219
and a plus B p5 doll

00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:03,349
let's support a long-run g4 mbutu's that

00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:06,289
means you can have up to 800 meter the

00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:08,809
Bhutto's connection the Wi-Fi is 2 by 2

00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:12,410
year MHz and we also support the indoor

00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:15,859
location a Wi-Fi RTP and bluetooth aod

00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:18,229
so had to CPU inside to sample 1 sample

00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:20,269
for Wi-Fi Bhutto's another simple for

00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:24,619
the vacation so you can developer

00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:27,229
certification on second simple since

00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:31,459
this is a 20 nanometer the process the

00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:34,190
node so we can serve up to 416 the

00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:36,589
clocks be the CPU clock speed and we

00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:39,140
have 512 the SRAM we can hold up to

00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:40,020
thirty two megahertz the flash you can

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,870
do a

00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:48,590
pretty decent work on the where you are

00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:48,590
advocating government this is some

00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:56,550
sample we are working with our our

00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:00,990
custom to deliver those pearl our next

00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:03,540
one is audio product this is a single

00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:07,890
band the Wi-Fi pass a boo to the photo

00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:14,000
to this since the 14 arm process known

00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:14,000
so simple only rung up to 160 megahertz

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,020
this old rich this some portable a

00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:23,040
shipping on the market like the speaker

00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:25,260
like the storytelling and home voice

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:31,320
control panel those are the shipping

00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:33,740
today and this is our boot was the audio

00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:37,320
solution and we have quite different

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:41,130
audio chipping here which has should two

00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:45,510
of them in here wise of photo support

00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:50,790
one is a five dollar support this most

00:43:45,510 --> 00:44:01,110
for the Bluetooth speaker or the Buddha

00:43:50,790 --> 00:44:05,780
has a also included tws okay so I'm done

00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,780
okay thank you

00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,490
