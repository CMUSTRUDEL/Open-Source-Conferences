Title: YVR18-507:Maintaining Old ARM Systems
Publication date: 2018-10-22
Playlist: Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018
Description: 
	This presentation from one of the ARM kernel contributors will tell you a bit about the old 32 bit ARM systems we are maintaining, when we have deleted systems, when we have modernized them and when we have added totally new systems even though they are technically old or even very old. We will also talk about what ARM systems are actually still out there in the wild and seeing wide deployments and extended life cycles for maintenance.

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,889
so somebody suggested I have the lecture

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,420
in Swedish since the majority of the

00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:21,640
audience is Swedish but we will stay

00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:24,369
with English this is a lecture I had a

00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,740
while ago in learn that our local

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,330
conference so I just I prototyped it and

00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,990
I tested it field tested it and I

00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,950
refined it a bit so we can enjoy the

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,030
lecture in a new improved variant I

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,870
started the lecture with the no

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,750
dialectic slide because I have this

00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:46,809
problem too much when discussing alarm

00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,640
systems that the question becomes

00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:50,770
dialectic like shall we do it this way

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,280
or that way like my way or the highway

00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,930
or shall we do device tree or a CPI you

00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,179
have to choose one the other one must

00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,719
die you can't use board fights ever

00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:03,640
anymore you have to kill them all and

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,549
this kind of reasoning instead I tried

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:11,439
to when it comes to this kind of stuff

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:13,030
where we as a community share a burden

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,530
or asset or maintenance or something

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,909
don't think in things as threats or

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,670
friends and foes and so on try to think

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:24,130
about the mass yeah this the people talk

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,710
about the ecosystems and so on the

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,290
Chinese managers they have this very art

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,060
of war loud say and this kind of

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,549
reasoning going on I really like that

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,360
that's much more constructive and it

00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:36,360
brings us to a better place

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,780
after doing the first version of the

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,150
lecture this happened actually in our

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,790
office I went down to get an umbrella I

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,190
was raining one day so I had to walk

00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,920
over and have lunch with with my fiancee

00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,870
and and there's this guy running around

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,640
on the phone and trying to talk to

00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,040
people to get to permission to get into

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,260
the basement of a day on the building

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,970
where we have our line' our office in

00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,350
sweden we are five people working there

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,310
most of them are sitting and now I think

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:09,670
and on the counter is this thing that's

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,500
the moxa art box of a brand new product

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:16,360
inside of that box is an armed v4 system

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,090
that he was coming to installed brand

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,740
new like the hardware is brand new the

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,990
currently sold the hardware is brand new

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,550
that he's installing to control the

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,580
ventilation he also brought along this

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,510
routered Netgear which is considerably a

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:34,030
newer MIPS processor but he is obviously

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,490
going to network connect this thing to

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,290
the internet that has an arm before very

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,190
old kernel running all the ventilation

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,330
in our building I like slightly

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,280
inconvenienced by that fact but that's

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,590
apparently how it works I couldn't tell

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,480
if the thing is a VPN or like shielded

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:55,150
off somehow I suspect not what's inside

00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:02,830
that box is the thing on the far right

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:07,630
it's a GSM enabled box art W 315 a with

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:11,290
the serial ports of the type rs-485 I

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:14,860
think so that they control their super

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,530
down the ventilation thingy from from

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,170
that box from absorbed and the moxa

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,019
makes a whole range of this they made

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,000
their own SOC at one point with

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:30,070
consultants from Farrah died in Taiwan

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,070
and they put in the FAA 526 custom core

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,049
into it and they are still manufacturing

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,000
that's silicon they are churning it out

00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,440
by the hour whenever they need a new

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,060
round round they make a new round of

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,010
ships and they start keep making these

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,500
devices and they put it in ventilation

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,630
all across the world they don't mean to

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,110
change what they are using one other

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:54,170
ship and that's the Cirrus Logic EP 9303

00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,050
which is an arm v40 same onewhat was

00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:02,570
used it yeah

00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:03,920
mm or nice embedded hacks and IOT worked

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:10,280
for them has worked all the time they

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:13,610
still use it and another brand new on v4

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,560
system that I found just like by working

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,230
on it I like this Gemini thing I just

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,890
recently cleaned it up upstream you can

00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,990
buy them you they are routers dns free

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,520
fortune that's an ass actually and this

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,720
other thing is a realtor with the video

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,740
screen and everything i have them

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,560
supported upstream now they are they are

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,400
still for sale and they are also using

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,020
the Farrah died 5 to 6 it's just just an

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,760
example I will define what they sorry

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,720
here here are some more example as the

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,280
Liebherr controller

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,610
I think horn was referring to it in the

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,050
2048 lecture it looks like that oh

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,670
that's a different one but I bet this

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,600
one has the same serious logic chip in

00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:01,420
it this is the next generation this one

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:06,220
on the picture but yeah

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:09,500
IMX Wow that's new

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,600
anyways they still I still get things

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,320
like this the BK free board it was

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:20,180
merged in December last year it has a

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,200
p90 302 and on this website of the

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,200
company that supplies

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,260
liebherr with their stuff they say that

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,990
this is a fully developed product

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:32,210
developed released in December 2004 so

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,230
you are welcome to use it in new designs

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,240
and deployments because to them dot NSO

00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:41,780
so EC is from 2004 that's not a problem

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,550
to them that's no concern for this kind

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,169
of people who make this kind of stuff if

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,480
you're making mobile phones you would

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:50,370
just laugh at them but yeah the whole

00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:53,229
world is not like like you

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,509
and then we have the product lifecycle

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,879
extensions there's my niceness again but

00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:02,759
post-market always an open wrt they are

00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:08,529
really they are pushing out a lot of

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:13,719
very nice code and platform support to

00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:15,879
the left and right they that might seem

00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:18,249
irrelevant to us because we are mostly

00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,099
working closely with silicon partners to

00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:24,069
provide new silicon to new products but

00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:26,529
this has very direct economic effects so

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:29,110
at one point on ebay you can buy some

00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:31,150
old reuters they they sell very cheap

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,370
like a few dollars like this barely

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,680
worth it to put it on ebay now somebody

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,240
ports open wrt to it and the next day

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,830
like the prices are up like with

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,499
hundreds of dollars because then you can

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,080
reflash it with open wrt and reuse the

00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:46,479
router again that is happening as we

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,779
speak all the time just some developer

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,089
and open wrt is supporting a new SOC or

00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:54,039
a new router and then immediately at the

00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:56,770
price rise on ebay that's the direct

00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,330
economic effect of it and i think we

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,729
will see that the same thing is going to

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,529
start happening with mobile phones as it

00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,149
becomes impossible as it becomes

00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:05,589
possible to actually upgrade them the

00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:07,209
android to the latest version and they

00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:09,249
are going to rise in value just because

00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:11,439
we can upgrade a software on it so it's

00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:13,899
a very real economic thing that's going

00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,689
on you might wonder why that is

00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:18,939
happening and i think i don't know if i

00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:23,439
brought the book it's I read in Bonnie

00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:25,029
Wong's book hardware hacking and Bonnie

00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,129
is our reverse engineer but he is also

00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:29,139
very good

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,990
silicon expert he's actual PhD I think

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:35,529
is in construction technology silicon

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,270
and so on he says that from what he can

00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,639
see from the data the there is a

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,439
deceleration in Moore's law and when you

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,029
see a deceleration in Moore's law that's

00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,709
a very controversial subject by the way

00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,389
but if there is a deceleration in

00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,159
Moore's law what happens is that product

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,349
cycles get longer the window of

00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,770
opportunity to produce systems on a

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:56,500
certain SOC becomes longer and yeah the

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,230
the lifetime of all SOC s and all

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,120
all products as long as they have enough

00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:05,200
memory and so on just gets longer and

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,820
longer so if that will be the first

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,460
thing you see if Moore's law is

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,170
decelerating then you will see longer

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,490
product life cycles and the first place

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,700
you are going to see it is where it

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:19,420
matters the least which is like those

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:21,700
IOT systems and then you will see it on

00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,410
other stuff like phones so maybe it's

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,540
the first sign of that I can't say if

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,850
it's like that but Bonnie thinks so and

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,350
he's a very smart guy so I think that he

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,039
might have a point we might be seeing

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,940
the first of this but apart from

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,919
lifecycle extensions there are other

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,820
reasons to upgrade the firmware on your

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:45,070
stuff see if I have some speaker notes

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:47,590
for it there are people saying that the

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:51,250
s in IOT stands for security and as a

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:53,710
good reason for that this malware over

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,840
this is for MIPS because of my

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,660
affiliation with the armed systems I am

00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,450
NOT taking any armed examples here but

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,910
MIPS had this problem with a slingshot

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,720
malware that was yeah I was in the major

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,450
part of the worlds Realtors of this type

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,900
[Music]

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:16,780
it was cool I think I have a notice yeah

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,330
it's the mikrotik router OS hardened

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:25,330
Linux kernel I wonder what the hardening

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:27,460
was it's an ethros a or 71 xx MIPS there

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,750
Linux kernel that they're using is 3 3 5

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:37,180
and it was used by intelligence agencies

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,770
to spy on us and building botnets and

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,400
other horrible things those are real

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:46,200
things not good it would be nice if if

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,200
we support updates of kernel long terms

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,900
so security updates is one blaming thing

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,820
these old systems need security updates

00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:58,590
and other things is performance updates

00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:02,250
it's just a little patch this is from

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,960
August so if you put in this patch set

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,490
the UDP stream performance is

00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,380
substantially improve the other would be

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,140
really nice to have on my my road to

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,520
write yeah but but I don't have it

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,190
because there's an old colonel er I

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,920
can't upgrade it because well I can

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,750
because I'm using open wrt but I think

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,430
that's the that's where we need to reach

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:25,260
do people need to upgrade our software a

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:27,510
little bit more when we say old old arm

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:32,700
systems this is this is what I mean it's

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:35,670
the green stuff there we have our b1 b2

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:40,980
b3 very nostalgic very nice stuff nobody

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:42,510
you system no we delete the dorm on be

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,940
free I'm actually mentioning that on a

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:50,360
slide but the stuff that we do support

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:53,240
so far or still is arm b4 through arm v6

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:57,750
when Lenora came into action was around

00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:01,890
v7 so that was legacy at that point all

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:04,500
of these old ones but these are very

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,750
widely deployed deployed things so when

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,390
I say legacy arm systems this is what I

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:13,320
refer to arm v7 already it's a new

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,910
system to in this regard I know some of

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,860
you might be Lhasa Tate so much that you

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,430
think that arm v7 is already trashed and

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,670
all 32 bit is already trashed but calm

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,670
down

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:30,130
and yeah this is another phenomenon

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,829
because some people when they go into a

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,839
project they want to just focus on one

00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,459
thing like the product product project

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,529
is just gonna be about this one thing

00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,389
we're gonna have like this focus on the

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,160
project and all the other things must go

00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:44,019
and that's dialectical thinking so

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,970
please avoid that in in Wikipedia they

00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:49,300
have this thing with inclusion lists and

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,709
deletion ist's so the inclusion is just

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,800
try to cover all kind of small and

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:56,019
obscure subjects in Wikipedia and the

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,910
delation nests coming in a say that's

00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,709
not of general interests so let's delete

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,199
it and then they have bashes about this

00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:04,410
all the time it's just like a loss I

00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:09,100
think it's just a waste of time they can

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:14,709
include it and or not but just try to

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,509
avoid the debate if you can other old

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:19,089
stuff that we have lying around this

00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:22,690
this deviant arm code bases that we have

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:24,370
never seen upstream and I've seen that

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,910
people are using them with all Colonels

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:30,970
and everything I put Linux that was

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,649
widely publicized at one point on slash

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,240
dot and those things people were super

00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:38,139
impressed that they managed to run Linux

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,029
on the ipod and open handhelds they had

00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:42,579
support for lots of AI packs and porn

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,829
pilots and handhelds like pretty much

00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:47,199
anyone they could run they that's also

00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:52,360
out of three most of it some of it went

00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:55,029
upstream the GP 42:42 GP 2 and ep2 x GP

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,910
42 and gp2x was like this Linux gaming

00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:03,130
consoles you would rule use name on it I

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:05,019
think and it was an awesome game console

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,829
and handheld like links or something

00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,990
like that and yeah open WT RT I

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,699
mentioned want a Vista did lots and lots

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,290
of consulting work and deployed lots of

00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:18,069
systems with deviant corners they are

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,839
also out there they're being used Bonnie

00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:21,459
as I mentioned he was using he was

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,480
working with his open hardware projects

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:28,300
like zombie and native a never merged

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,009
upstream you would think that these

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,559
people are like open hardware people

00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,540
would support open software buy or open

00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,750
source by merging their supporting into

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,520
the

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:40,120
in Linux kernel they didn't tell time or

00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,970
effort or yeah I don't know why open

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,410
easy said X they did an attempt to merge

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,920
some of the stuff they didn't get very

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:50,590
far with it some of it is upstream and

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,480
the GoPro cameras and also can on

00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,310
cameras professional that all run armed

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,750
they they are nowhere to be seen I

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,460
haven't seen them the source code is out

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,730
there but and I think there are

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,620
sometimes communities for it right

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:08,230
maybe mark want to say something it's a

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:12,310
camera enthusiast this this kind of

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:16,420
stuff is is floating around most of it

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:19,060
is using old arm associate GoPro cameras

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:24,120
are newer but I think they use arm 11

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,120
quite a lot so its arm v6 a lot of it

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,970
what is upstream what however like did

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,980
land upstream is this stuff and that's a

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,480
little bit about how things came to be

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,960
and I will explain about that in a

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,970
minute

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,530
so all these development ports that I

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,270
have in my office they're well supported

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,550
honestly not just thanks to me that's

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:46,920
because the arm department that started

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:49,270
to work seriously with arm Linux they

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,310
started with support for the integrator

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,040
up there and then the versatile and and

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,570
the real views and those things were the

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,120
first things that were officially

00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,740
supported from arm so they put in this

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,540
as an example and then all the vendors

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,250
took that example and derived into

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:08,740
products so they are very well supported

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:10,990
upstream and I sell you is another thing

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,570
this is a very interesting thing machine

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,870
you probably recognize that slug that

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,490
was because this was before the big big

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,530
board and all these kind of things so at

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,089
the time that that I xp for based thing

00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,360
came out that was the thing that you

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:27,190
used for for makers like later name

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,470
makers that's maybe an anachronism at

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,260
this point but people who wanted to like

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,300
control a few relays watering pipes or

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,390
whatever they would take one of those NS

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,950
a little to stand I would hack it and

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,370
pull out the GPIO lines and use that

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:44,340
Nass it's actually in US and use that as

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,660
as their big bigger board that's

00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,830
so that was before we had this maker

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,830
board then we would use that

00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:02,270
let's see upstream first yes upstream

00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,270
first that's interesting at one point

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,220
why didn't what at one point the the

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,380
colonel maintained errs and so on

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,660
realized that a lot of this code is just

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,090
sitting around in upstream like in out

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,400
of three gears and it's not reaching

00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,980
upstream so they started to push out the

00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,560
message upstream first like put your put

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,210
your stuff upstream and they were I

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,770
don't know what exactly they were

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,540
referring to I think it was like the

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,430
Android systems when that started coming

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,560
out a lot of a lot of Android phones

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:35,190
that that's when this started to become

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:38,220
an issue I think for for servers and

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,990
Intel that happened lots earlier but in

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:48,540
the arm space it happened around the

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:50,250
time of of Android and a lot of people

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,640
like Mel Gorman I think I said the

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,770
upstream first Chris right as I said it

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,140
Andrew Morton at several times John

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:00,630
masters also like strong proponent for

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:06,890
upstream first strategy is like a very

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:10,050
real strategy that is pushed out from

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,790
Colonel what custodians or should I say

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,320
like the people in the business to

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:19,350
understand how the how the Linux kernel

00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:23,300
work and what does upstream first mean

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,300
does it mean upstream your hobby project

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:31,740
yeah we could think a bit about that so

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,300
there is a little bit of tension between

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,960
would you say like a hobbyist stands to

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:40,350
to Linux and kernel development and

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:45,310
company stands I think at one point

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:48,610
jonathan Courbet wrote in lwn that the

00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,230
the number of hobbyist contributors is

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,490
going down quite rapidly because

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:57,940
everybody's getting employed by

00:17:51,490 --> 00:18:00,250
companies but don't forget I think it's

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,050
like pretty important to understand that

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,640
there is still a substantial hobbyist

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,800
community and you might say things like

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,390
I don't care about open wrt and I don't

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,920
care about open handheld and all these

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,070
things this is not important for the

00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,660
business but maybe at that point it's

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,850
time to remind yourself a little bit

00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,420
about the roots of these things Linux

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:22,030
was a hobby project arm Linux was a

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,130
hobby project and this is the I couldn't

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,060
find like a good illustration that just

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:31,120
says that explicitly but Russell King

00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:37,090
started to port Leonard storm in 1994

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:41,890
and here's three years later there's

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:44,950
like a bit of talk in the community in

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:50,320
November 97 the patches were boiling for

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:52,960
a kernel 2.0 dot one release and David

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,260
rustling currently our CTO at Leonora he

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,870
was getting involved in July 97 and he

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,810
was submitting some patches and

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:06,520
questions about the EBS 80 to 85 from

00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:08,380
digital and these were integrated all

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,820
the arm patches were integrated into

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:14,650
Linux to 200

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:18,610
in January 1999 so two years after this

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:20,030
like one and a half year after this and

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,590
[Music]

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:26,179
everybody was at the time mostly talking

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:28,980
actually about the future of arm because

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:32,190
the digital strongarm division had been

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,960
purchased by Intel so at the time a lot

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,020
of people thought that yeah or maybe

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,100
there's just like going to disappear or

00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,910
something like that people were actually

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:45,480
worried that almost dying architecture

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:48,480
but what happens in right after arm

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,000
Linnet arm is introduced into Linux in

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,120
97 is that David rustling moves to arm

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,730
and he starts up the the Linux division

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,640
or I think kattiline might have been

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,929
employed about that time for arm and so

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,610
on so they are starting to bring in

00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:06,059
people to actually do Linux development

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,110
on the integrator board the one that was

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,370
in the previous picture

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:14,970
so when kernel to 400 comes out you have

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:17,670
arm before support and you also support

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,490
a few hobbyist projects like the short

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:23,370
machines sa 1100 is already there the

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,710
footbridge is there and what is the name

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:31,830
of this thing that I have on my machine

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:36,120
on my desk bottom net winder net winder

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:39,380
it even talks that machine so these

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,730
things were there from the beginning and

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,890
already at this point it started to get

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,010
unmaintainable so we started to split

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:51,600
out this per machine directories and

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:53,910
Russel started to split them out and in

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,700
October 99 we get the announcement that

00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:59,160
arm is working on the integrator

00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:02,520
reference design and that is eventually

00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:06,650
integrated in 2001 actually in kernel 2

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:10,809
for free so then we get get the real

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:14,200
community so

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:16,289
what we see is that Linux tortures a

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,029
hobby project graduates to like a

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:21,039
business supported enterprise project

00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:24,490
arm Linux goes the same path he starts

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,980
as a Probie project and then continues

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:29,230
as a business project and I think that's

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,639
that's still happening to a certain

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,230
extent there is still a number of

00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:34,809
hobbyists especially around route

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:38,740
through space especially around the post

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:40,629
market OS that I mentioned so please

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,909
don't see these people as new so a

00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:45,039
nuisance like yeah why are you still

00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:46,570
requiring us to maintain that platform

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,399
like it's coming from there we are

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,639
coming from there all of us it's it's

00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:54,419
what arm Linux is about so please be a

00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:54,419
bit inclusive

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,490
so when we are talking about maintaining

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:05,260
alarm systems what are we talking about

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,260
we can just look at the number of

00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,760
machines now there is a bunch of known

00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,630
not all the machines here of course also

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:19,070
some new ones but we see this explosion

00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:23,810
of machines but especially those on the

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:29,150
top that were there in 2005 those are

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:32,990
the old machines CLP s7 11x and I OPI xp

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:40,190
for so on you can get all details if you

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:43,370
want to mister is there some benefit to

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,200
fixing all platforms you could say like

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,730
yeah why not just take the latest their

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,870
board that somebody's just tossing in

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,580
your knee and work on that instead

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:55,750
because it's all new and shiny and this

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:59,000
smells of epoxy well the thing is I

00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:01,040
think I talked to somebody today about a

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,850
certain development ship where they

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,280
broke the interconnector there's always

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,930
some kind of problem with all ships and

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,220
then they're new they will risk in the

00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,540
silicon and then we will be actually

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,910
working but things that are put into

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,590
products products and been around for a

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,900
long time they you know it actually

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,390
works people are using it in product

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,610
might have some hardware quirks we might

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:26,930
think about like the the funniness with

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:29,720
IXP for PC I think that's a bit shaky

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:33,140
but it's possible to make products on

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,610
them and there's no rush there is not a

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,740
vendor like you're breathing in your

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,210
neck and constantly like with this one

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,440
finger on the first forward button

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,850
saying like yeah we need to have this

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,620
out on the market now time to market

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,450
time to market time to market like you

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,520
don't have that when you work with all

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,410
the arm systems or older products or

00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,640
hobbyist things it's pretty cool and

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,410
cool a nice place to be all the pieces

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,280
fall into place because now we have the

00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:00,080
proper subsystems for everything because

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,649
the new sister the new warm systems are

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,110
put in there

00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:06,029
we never get featured completion like

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,460
for the Gemini machine I think I support

00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,960
all the hardware yes all everything

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,620
that's on the associate is supported and

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,149
the simpler the SOC the more the easier

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,070
it is to get it supported I think for

00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:19,260
the moxa or chip we have also complete

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,659
support we can be there some rough edges

00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:25,080
probably but we support it fully with

00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,760
the upstream kernel we don't get that we

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,070
get that like feeling out completion

00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,140
that a lot of people working with the up

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,299
streaming like a Qualcomm stuff like be

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,130
honest working with like yeah we'd never

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:38,100
really get there because there's always

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,659
something new that that needs to be

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,130
added something really obscure or

00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:43,049
something that needs a new subsystem

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,240
something that is but but when you work

00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,320
with old arm system what you get alarm

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,929
systems what you get this actually

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,169
feature completion like it's finished

00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:55,500
we support everything it just works it's

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,000
nice isn't it and I guess for Intel

00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,140
people that's normal business at least

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,630
that seems to be the way they are

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,340
thinking but for us arm people it's more

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,600
less than normal business like you are

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,710
almost there and then are there some

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,559
touches that you need to apply to

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:16,260
actually get your system working another

00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:18,960
benefit as I said or yeah fact of fixing

00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,760
old arm all platforms is like these

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,470
people can actually add security updates

00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,779
now I don't know if people are picking a

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:29,580
new box out Kerman also the new Gemini

00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:32,909
kernel so the new EP 9302 kernels well

00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,169
for EP 9302 I think we can be pretty

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:36,020
confident that they're actually picking

00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:38,039
them because there is consultant to

00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,320
submitting board file patches

00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,510
so these alarm systems are actually

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,230
getting the security patches in some

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,990
cases and they are good illustrations

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,059
maybe that's a bit of a moot point but

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,649
they are using all the frameworks the

00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,779
way they are supposed to be used like

00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:56,850
for the Gemini machine I noticed that

00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:59,100
the term of framework that we have now

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,230
in the kernel can support cooling the

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,230
enclosure enclosure like controlling the

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,820
fan and reading the this answer that

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,940
used to be in user space in a very

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,210
obscure binary in the vendor code well

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,470
we got rid of that we can do

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,759
and they currently should be done in the

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:17,350
kernel so when you work with new systems

00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,179
they're always disliked lacking

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,980
infrastructure this or that of some kind

00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:22,629
so we don't have that when you work with

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,759
our armed systems in that way it's

00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:26,409
usually smooth you don't run into this

00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,210
really hard brick walls of having to

00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:30,220
invent new sub sub systems and things

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,460
like that you can just go on get it in

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,080
there but sometimes they are this new

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,740
these old norm systems or sub

00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:42,039
architectures are a burden and that's

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:45,669
especially when the original maintainer

00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:47,799
stops to contribute new features stop to

00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:50,139
proactively modernize the core code base

00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,909
like we we invent something like device

00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:55,090
tree and say please move to this and

00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:58,779
they're like nah I don't wanna that's

00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:01,210
not very nice and especially when we

00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:04,600
have to hack around these old frameworks

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:07,269
and try to just I think the PMU in the

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,070
arm was like one thing we debated at one

00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:11,830
time and I just like yeah just drop it

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,389
done because so like I had this one-off

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,220
ship that they did the wrong way and

00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:15,789
merge to interrupts into one actor just

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,919
forget it

00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,720
done it's much easier if we just I'm not

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:26,289
using perf on that platform anyway and I

00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:27,879
can live without it so especially when

00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:29,499
we have this radical changes when we

00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:32,860
started to do everything with device 3

00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:35,110
if the maintainer don't want to fix it

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:38,259
or if the there is no maintainer there

00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:40,509
anymore or they are just responding very

00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:44,159
sporadically to mail then it becomes a

00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:44,159
bit of a burden for us as or maintainer

00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,509
when is it an asset

00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:55,309
well when the maintainer sticks around

00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:57,769
all smiles when the maintainer brings a

00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:00,229
large user base that test new kernels

00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:01,580
and finds bug totally unrelated to their

00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:04,249
specific hardware they are fixing things

00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:09,289
for all of us on their iPad or whatever

00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:11,720
it is I mean if they find a privilege

00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,080
escalation issue on an iPad I don't I

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,299
don't care

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,749
they found a privilege escalation issue

00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:18,499
that's good I don't know if that does

00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:20,779
ever happen

00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:22,340
I think it could happen they find small

00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,019
bugs all the time definitely all these

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,820
maintainer that maintain really old on

00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:32,570
crappy systems or whatever you want to

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:34,729
call them the maintainer is motivated by

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,039
that architecture to pursue other work

00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:39,529
relevant for more architectures that's

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,929
what I'm after there for example the

00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,820
Nokia n900 is a very good example of

00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:46,849
this that that phone is totally obsolete

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,340
that OMA is like not used quotation

00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:50,840
marks anyway in any way but the

00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,220
enthusiasts that are working with it

00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,700
they are inventing stuff all the time

00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:58,369
like GPS subsystems and the modem

00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,929
subsystems and improving the audio and

00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,509
so on so you can have low latency cause

00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,950
this kind of stuff they do all the time

00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:05,450
in the background and only the more

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,309
modern systems come along and like oh

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,039
here's a nice thing well where did that

00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:13,419
come from it came from some enthusiasts

00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:15,830
sitting there with his Nokia n900 so

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:17,960
it's actually they can be very good

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,830
maintainer so they can be very valuable

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,830
to the community

00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:31,860
and bring in people what did we actually

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,750
delete I ran this by arms I think it's

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:37,710
actually correct

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:41,700
are we free we had to delete it was only

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:44,790
used in the RPC and it was broken it

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:47,820
wasn't working the risk PC used it but

00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:49,560
yeah it wasn't it wasn't working anymore

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,720
everybody with a risk piece he had

00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,860
anyways upgraded it to an SI 110 core I

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,480
don't know if there are any users left

00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,980
of it

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,080
it doesn't seem like Russell is even

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,910
using it anymore

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:08,040
the shark I deleted because yeah I try

00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,610
to modernize it I sent a patch to update

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,410
the timer code and the maintainer said

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:17,510
I'd I don't really run that machine so I

00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:22,500
can't really test it ok can I delete it

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:24,720
I'd rather you not like where you can

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,220
just do get revert if you get some spare

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,080
cycles and you feel that you want to fix

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:32,430
it up and test these patches so he

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,420
agreed to let me delete it and the CLP

00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:40,050
has 7500 the PXA like this other things

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:42,060
also got deleted pretty I think in most

00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,980
cases Russell just dropped them because

00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,640
the remain tiny was not responding and

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,500
not fixing up known issues so we did

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,240
delete a bunch of stuff but they was a

00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,830
it was always more or less for the same

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,510
reason the maintainer wasn't the first

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,060
type which is like being dragged along

00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:00,650
by his dog he's just like just leaving

00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,650
it around and not not responding

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:12,170
I guess Mac MSM would be an example of

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:12,170
this but this may be a bit of

00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,390
controversial issue some things were

00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,710
deleted by the vendors i was working for

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,510
st ericsson and they did some

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:25,250
experimental silicone that was never put

00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:29,370
into products so i deleted it

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:33,570
Exynos samsung made some enterprise

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,560
silicone 44:15 and 5540 well it never

00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,820
materialized

00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,870
so they deleted it and

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,970
STMicroelectronics made is to set top

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,620
box platforms and they were never used

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,510
so they deleted it and there's no

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,710
community around it so don't get me

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,270
wrong if i would have been some

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,980
enthusiast saying like well i'm actually

00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,890
using that thing then we probably would

00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:57,510
not have deleted it if they are happy to

00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:58,950
you know work on it so what did we

00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:02,660
modernize now we're talking about

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,660
maintaining old alarm systems

00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:14,139
yeah the reference designs I've

00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:17,289
modernized them most to me and arm were

00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:19,629
were so kind to send me all older older

00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:21,450
integrators and versatile son real view

00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:24,519
so now I have them in my office I can

00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,169
take care of them and fix them we have

00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,000
to buy new shops for them it was a lots

00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:30,519
of fun your fan I was mounting all this

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,340
IKEA shelves the other dyson's it's fine

00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:36,250
it's fine it's good for everyone

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,870
samsung also modernized RS 3 C and s 5c

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,539
platforms I don't know exactly what

00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:43,779
their use used for I think some mobile

00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:50,470
things like not really sure but they

00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:52,980
have long support cycles it was a lots

00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,980
of phones yeah

00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:06,400
yeah I was at this candy bar TomTom yeah

00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:21,470
so there's a direct line in from SPC all

00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:23,780
the way to to Exynos all right so yeah

00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:26,300
they still use them and they still

00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,040
there's still products using it and they

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,960
are actually still deploying fixes and

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,820
new kernels on everything for it so yeah

00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,430
they modernized it it was a team in

00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:37,280
Poland I think very good very skilled

00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:42,800
people they modernized it see LTS seven

00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:45,290
11 X and Oh map - and Oh map free very

00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,970
well supported and still being sold and

00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,100
deployed in new systems I think so it's

00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:52,400
important to have it free scale IMX is

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,130
one of the biggest embedded ship sets

00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,110
out there it runs on everything often

00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,850
with things like video screens connected

00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:01,730
to it

00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:04,280
elevators and things like that Marvel

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,770
Kirkwood is used in numerous routers and

00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,270
probably other stuff as well and Gemini

00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:13,730
I'm more modernized it's used in

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:18,140
Realtors and NAS type devices network

00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:22,630
equipment so we modernized all that but

00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:25,490
these are left so I would like to have

00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:27,980
her discussion or have some help with

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:30,440
this I am currently investigating going

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,780
in and modernizing EP 93 xx after

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:37,600
learning about all the wide industrial

00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,600
deployments of this this associate

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:46,960
the others the things I colored in blue

00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:49,210
seems to be especially important the

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,830
black stuff is more like if you're a

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,260
hobbyist and you really need it

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:57,369
I think DaVinci is probably should be

00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:59,290
blue it's it's kind of parent of the

00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:04,839
Keystone and pretty important so it's

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:07,150
probably also pretty important oh map

00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:12,400
one is being actively modernised by one

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:15,430
person and for the rest I don't see very

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:22,000
much activity PXA I think there is some

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:22,690
activity on PXI so for them okay okay

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,089
whatever

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:29,890
okay we'll fix it but if you have any of

00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:31,960
these systems and you're using it or

00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:35,160
just thinking about modernizing it

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,160
you're very welcome

00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:39,790
yeah well I I don't have time to fix

00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:46,950
everything in the world but I fixed a

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:46,950
few of them so yeah

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:53,750
now I think mark is actually maintained

00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,750
or one of their handheld the thing is

00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:10,790
but it's pxi right now he will test your

00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:13,310
patches so Sharon enjoy please fix this

00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:16,370
if you can what else do we have what

00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:18,950
could we add well there is actually what

00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,840
the thing is not now we have all the

00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,420
device three infrastructure and all the

00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,610
subsystems that we ever wanted back down

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,710
so if you want to go in and add back

00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,750
iPod Linux we could very well do that it

00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,510
wouldn't even cause us very much of a

00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,710
support burden these days it's fine you

00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,140
would just put the drivers in the

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,390
appropriate fire subsystem maybe some

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,010
lines for a certain flash ship here or

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,780
there and you can get it running

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,400
probably today with the latest current

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,470
provided there is enough memory to run

00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,090
it otherwise there is this nice tiny

00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:52,730
Linux initiative and you can probably

00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:56,210
run that and and I mean if you think

00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:58,250
that I pax or iPods or GM 32 wherever it

00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:01,010
is really nice and you would really like

00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,930
to have it upstream sound patches I'm

00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,430
you will probably fix something else

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:08,390
along the way that we just forgot about

00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:11,060
so I would say from my point of view

00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:18,110
this is this is the kind of stuff that

00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:20,510
the diversity the diversity makes it so

00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:23,480
much easier to find the right fit for

00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:25,760
subsystems and unexplored areas and so

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,890
on it's not just because it's fun as an

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,050
engineer but more often than not

00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,310
somebody actually needs that or was

00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,560
thinking about I should look into that

00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:35,120
someday and if an obvious does it they

00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:41,420
just pick it up and all that's nice

00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:43,790
that's very nice thank you I'm a bit

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,280
puzzled that we don't see Amborella

00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:48,020
and canon cameras and so on communities

00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,890
I don't know where they are they they

00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,890
should be somewhere I think

00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,650
[Music]

00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,439
[Music]

00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:24,620
they're a bit expensive so it would be

00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:26,880
sad to break them I guess yeah so

00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,310
anyways if you have some takeaways from

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,590
this I would say like please do not

00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,960
think about or me through arm v6s

00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,200
irrelevant or obsolete or something like

00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,180
that

00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,650
because people are shipping new systems

00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,700
as we are syste sitting here and your

00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,500
life depends on them

00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,910
so yep you might call them irrelevant on

00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,590
the next day you can't breathe in your

00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:52,130
office and it's because this on v4

00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:52,130
system is a denial of service so I

00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,460
I have a little bit of worry that

00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:04,170
sometimes some of the lead developers or

00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,830
head developers I don't know what they

00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,330
call them they are they may I think

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,820
that's a that's a verb called to

00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,430
velocity in English I don't know if it's

00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,410
it's a real word or link or something

00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,060
but it's also called like speed

00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,850
blindness or something like you drive

00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:23,400
very fast and you don't you don't

00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,660
realize how fast you're going so when

00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,070
you get into a smaller Road it

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,680
everything's just feel like it's going

00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:30,750
really slow so that's the phenomenon

00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,510
where we're people who work on very

00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:37,410
modern or a auric 64 systems think that

00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:39,810
a 32 bit is dead nobody is using me

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,090
nobody quotation mark why isn't the

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,530
world is not really like that a lot of

00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,660
people are using it they are deploying

00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:55,230
new silicon they are making new silicon

00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:59,880
using the 32-bit things not not just new

00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:02,340
stuff and companies and hobbyists should

00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,720
not be at odds about this if the

00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,270
hobbyist can take care of some of the

00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,390
old silicon and let them I do not

00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:11,760
propose to delete the stuff only if they

00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,350
are not really maintaining it I think we

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,720
had this discussion the other day on the

00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:17,310
cornerstone mailing list like when do we

00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,820
actually delete an architecture and I

00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:24,120
took the example of the M 68k

00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:29,040
architecture the motorola 68000 was very

00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:31,770
popular in the 1990s or even 80s and it

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,230
has MMU and everything you can connect

00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:37,260
some megabytes of memory to it and run

00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:41,700
it the latest on incarnation the 68000

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:44,130
60 was made in 1994 I think something

00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,540
like this and that is an architecture

00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,360
that's pretty well maintained in the

00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,370
Linux kernel so somebody who thinks that

00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:54,120
all this crap could just go in as I like

00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:57,300
let's delete em 68k yeah why not it's

00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:59,660
old and then they will get to one of the

00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:04,670
angriest Belgians too

00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:07,400
kick them around but but the the thing

00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:10,100
is that don't see it that way it doesn't

00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,470
see that like in this architecture like

00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:17,290
as long as there are users its I will

00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:17,290
just see it like the kernel idea API

00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:27,110
yeah exact yeah I called fire yeah I

00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,830
agree there's a new as to the picture

00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,350
indeed

00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,150
now the thing is I usually I think that

00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,310
we should see architectures and sub

00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,110
architectures and arm systems more like

00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:40,490
we see the ABI like we make a promise

00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:44,180
that we will not break the ABI so we and

00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:51,230
Torvalds has very thoroughly emphasized

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:54,590
that not always in good ways but I would

00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,210
like like wisely say that we have made a

00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:58,150
promise to maintain the system as long

00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:02,660
as there are users of it just like we

00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:04,820
promised to maintain a kernel ABI so if

00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,620
there is a user and we meet you sir I

00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,960
also specified very clearly that we mean

00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:12,680
somebody that can reflash kernels

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,260
compile kernels test them and this kind

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:19,160
of stuff not aunt Tilly I mean I mean

00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,840
real users in our real users if if there

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,600
are users who can compile kernels

00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:28,190
support tool chain test new patches up

00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,040
modernized systems and we don't delete

00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:34,300
them just because it's older that's like

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,300
the question all these irrelevant

00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:42,240
and a little bit yeah if we don't take

00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,660
care of our long-term support I do my

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,330
share please do your share so somebody

00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,640
does it because well sometimes I feel

00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:52,230
with this IOT companies that they toss a

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,090
lot of products out there and put it in

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,290
our ventilation systems and elevators

00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,110
and then they just go away

00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:59,940
sometimes the company goes bankrupt

00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:01,710
sometimes they just form a new division

00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,870
and say like yeah whatever that division

00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,570
did before it's not really my concern or

00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:09,360
they get acquired by another company

00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:11,640
I think Motorola parts of Motorola got

00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,670
acquired by Lenovo and that was this

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,650
really nice Motorola 360 smartwatch that

00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,080
a lot of people got and they are all

00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:21,990
breaking down now because of battery

00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,610
problems and they like can will you

00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,550
provide support for it and it's like no

00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:28,920
we're Lenovo it's not really our problem

00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:36,360
so this kind of attitude is quite common

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:38,610
in companies but as a community person

00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,960
they don't think like a company yes we

00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:46,500
think more like think about users and

00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,940
face users working for Leonardo we are

00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,950
in a little bit of split situation are

00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,390
we community people are we like talking

00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:53,760
to users in a community or are we

00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,010
talking to companies like legal bodies

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,540
and their needs and they have to juggle

00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,930
this somehow so that's where the tension

00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:03,450
comes out but there is a definite need

00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:08,480
for a long term support I am trying

00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:12,780
personally to work some with it and I

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,880
prioritize IOT because as far as I can

00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,840
see those have the longest support

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,400
cycles and maybe it is as Bonnie says

00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,990
like it's because Moore's law is

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,880
decelerating so we're seeing this really

00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,780
long support cycles first in IOT and

00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,230
then we're going to see it in other

00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:32,490
stuff but I would prioritize that and

00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:36,120
I'm gonna prioritize the EP 93 xx going

00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:39,750
forward and also IXP 4 xx because of

00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:41,280
large industry interest from companies

00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,870
who are not really in the community or

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,000
contributing very much but which are

00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,740
just important for our infrastructure in

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,960
the society so it's just the right thing

00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:54,380
to do

00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,380
thank you any questions Amit

00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,759
if there's a plan to change the status

00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:09,910
of the earn 42 maintainer snide weird

00:45:06,759 --> 00:45:14,440
more maintaining it on a per subsystem

00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:18,430
or per sub architecture level so that's

00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:21,999
the bulk of the maintenance when it

00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:24,609
comes to the arm 42 core Russell has

00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:28,930
moved it to occasional patches I think

00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:31,150
something like this odd fixes so he and

00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:35,140
he told me that that he is not really

00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:37,359
letting it go yet and and that's his

00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,849
stance I mean somebody who's got a

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,769
strong interest in working with arm

00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:50,200
could probably suggest and leave himself

00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:52,900
a sub sub maintainer I guess but yeah

00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,640
that totally depends I think our 42 is

00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,559
very important and we need to support it

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,559
personally but

00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:14,480
at the same time the architecture itself

00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,480
is

00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:31,240
it's quite natural stable architecture

00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:45,290
now there we are

00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:48,260
we see some security mitigations Russell

00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:50,119
actually has done recently and if you

00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,980
put patches in his patch tracker he will

00:46:50,119 --> 00:47:01,089
merge them unless there is something he

00:46:51,980 --> 00:47:01,089
has personal against them yes yeah

00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,840
see progress

00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:37,540
No now that's yeah yeah that's what I'm

00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:39,130
trying to get across like that's that we

00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,290
see very long support cycles for these

00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,540
things because they just work on v4 is

00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:49,090
just fine for driving a serial line and

00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:50,740
a few GPIO s and sometimes they did they

00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:52,690
just have a smaller OS than Linux of

00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,260
course and then it becomes another

00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:59,860
problem about grading and security fixes

00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,990
but for their business yeah this

00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,910
supports cycle stabilized in the early

00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:07,420
2000s and they haven't upgraded since

00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:09,040
because there's no reason and if Bonnie

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,720
is right then we're going to see this

00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,720
more and more in more and more segments

00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:24,099
yeah I agree with you I think we have

00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,319
seen little sometimes a little bit too

00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:28,539
rapid development and things not really

00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,189
getting cleaned up and stabilized we

00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:32,589
have lots of lots of lots of clean ups

00:48:30,189 --> 00:48:34,449
to do so this it's not like we are out

00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:36,519
of a job for the next hundred years even

00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:49,869
if we just stop developing new chipsets

00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:52,059
right now pauran yeah yeah the economics

00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:53,619
of it is is tricky especially with this

00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:58,949
companies going out of business and then

00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:58,949
just disappearing yeah

00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:13,990
this one oh yeah that one let's go back

00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:19,210
to that one we have good we have lots of

00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:24,599
time this thing's so you wanted to add

00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:24,599
something oh wait a minute

00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:39,090
these are things I think yeah they the

00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:41,820
devices H&I in some cases so then they

00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:44,070
are not not even possible to written to

00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:46,340
get them anymore other even not even for

00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,340
me by

00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,410
you know

00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,720
[Music]

00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:25,040
all right let's have a continue dinner

00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,000
discussion about it I think we're

00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,370
finished yep

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,280
thanks guys

00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:37,289
[Applause]
