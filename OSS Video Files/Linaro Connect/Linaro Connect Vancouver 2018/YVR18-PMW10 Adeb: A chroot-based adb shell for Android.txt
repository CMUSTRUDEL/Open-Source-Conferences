Publication date: 2018-10-04
Playlist: Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018
Description: 
	Android systems and kernel developers need a more mainstream and a typical Linux userspace for development/debugging. Adeb (or androdeb) is a tool I wrote to make this possible. This talk describes the adeb design, initial motivation, usescases and shows a demo.
