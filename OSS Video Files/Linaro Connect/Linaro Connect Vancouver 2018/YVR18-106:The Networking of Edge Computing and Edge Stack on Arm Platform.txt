Title: YVR18-106:The Networking of Edge Computing and Edge Stack on Arm Platform
Publication date: 2019-05-09
Playlist: Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018
Description: 
	Edge computing is emerging technologies which demand lower latency and accelerated processing at the edge. Edge stack performs the data processing at the edge of the network, provides virtualized NFs and physical NFs orchestration near data sources. And it's well known that Arm platform is highly flexible with high performance and high availability, so it is very suitable for being used as an edge computing main resource. 
A high performance and universally supported networking mechanism is the core of the success of edge stack. The presentation gives out the networking architecture of edge stack used for the high performance edge computing on Arm platform. The main points are listed below, but not limited to:
1. The networking architecture of integrated edge stack which consists of unified networking/orchestration of VMs, containers and physical compute hosts;
2. The use case of edge computing networking end to end;
3. High performance data plane acceleration used in edge stack
4. Light weight and integrated orchestration technology on Arm platform
5. Fd.io VPP based virtual switching in edge stack
6. Performance evaluation and comparison of the networking mechanism for Arm and other platforms

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:49,960
hello good afternoon I think that we can

00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,960
start okay

00:00:53,289 --> 00:01:06,759
so go up hello everybody thank you for

00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:11,100
my session my name is Zoey I'm working

00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:11,100
on every project

00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:20,590
Tommy today was proposed money by my

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,270
colleague travel but anyway if you don't

00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:35,140
get here tonight no we suck so I

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:40,869
represent policy ha so this has a hot

00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:43,810
pocket for wire different people like

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:47,619
still have people might understand other

00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:51,970
terms from this when actually I would

00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:58,179
like to share like sort of like work

00:01:51,970 --> 00:02:03,250
from our team computing but actually

00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:10,650
like hey computing is that is still in

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:12,840
very high say our I've introduced what

00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,000
we have done with

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,310
we are do hopefully if you are

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,550
interested in future we can let that

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:29,940
clever immunity or some other work

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:34,650
together so this is today I begin I'd

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:40,160
like to discuss so what is really at

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:44,900
computing and why we have any computing

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:51,180
after that I will sure like the Sun

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:57,840
Committee which focus on computer per

00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:01,489
day especially on the new day and they

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:13,549
also like the present a proposal

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:13,549
referenced a are we to a greater project

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:25,010
after that I will show some of our

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:28,799
progress projects in different

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:34,730
activities business you work in progress

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,730
so I will also discuss our best

00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:56,599
so what is computer information and

00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:02,230
collection and the best closer to the

00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:06,980
data sources and a consumers like device

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:13,549
instead process alterna in civilized and

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:16,359
cloud described in another way I can say

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:21,590
the computer or network resurfaced Allah

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:32,710
he visited us and a capacitor we call a

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:36,979
community the big girl on this side of

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:42,020
devices like the the connected past the

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:55,240
mobile devices and the song factory

00:04:42,020 --> 00:05:00,860
automation devices so I stopped with

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:03,229
Shirley you produce like quite a bit

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:10,220
medicine because there is a long path

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:15,259
from A to C to like stuff we saw like a

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:18,909
cloud just nearby the device provide a

00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,909
much less maxi

00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:32,219
so this is not a question so why is a

00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:32,219
conclusion so quite obvious the

00:05:32,549 --> 00:06:09,239
centralized data center as you can see

00:05:36,609 --> 00:06:17,909
all the devices connected to the by the

00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:22,019
network permeability we use that soon so

00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:26,039
the first region there is a from cloud

00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:29,789
services their education and capacity

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:39,119
advances especially back and compute

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:39,119
capability they need such myself very

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:54,720
for IP devices because from you

00:06:46,229 --> 00:07:02,130
solution is an egg-like are some very

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:08,470
continued basically if you say the

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:11,440
roughly delay is 5 so the user extremely

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:18,220
very bad so this is the poor mark

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:23,530
advances like our lives the surprises

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:27,039
they actually just very possible

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:31,139
producers they are concerned on mercy

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:38,699
the Pegasus pretty so if you senator

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:38,699
it's called vulnerable to attack

00:07:42,770 --> 00:09:04,760
so okay yeah just for the first

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:12,770
animation cloud and oh oh

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,769
[Music]

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,210
[Music]

00:12:30,550 --> 00:13:12,100
- okay

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,290
so

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,519
[Music]

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,340
[Music]

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,690
okay

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:08,280
I said this over and it'll be customized

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:18,150
we'll be right back so we can apply if a

00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:18,150
customer is very deeply in resources the

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,510
because we have different kind of news

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,510
amenities so

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,569
we are

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Oh

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:03,279
[Music]

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,239
[Music]

00:19:18,920 --> 00:20:08,040
we serving an American soldier we will

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:10,920
test also some like where we stay on the

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:18,120
right side the right side

00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:21,530
this is compute you know you can see

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,530
some mistake

00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,540
the

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,980
[Music]

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:41,300
[Music]

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:43,810
my sex for the pack do you have any

00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,810
pistols

00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,840
yeah

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,470
what we the West so actually

00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,790
job

00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:54,590
you know Abraham about security you know

00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:56,350
like there's specific security

00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,970
mechanisms they have in America to

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:02,029
ensure that you got a trusted platform I

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,799
mean securing a sway the security

00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:08,679
implications are and how about the

00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:08,679
project might address security

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:30,450
from us so they are blueprint

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,409
but all this

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,500
it's not but the first thing

00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,600
Security's the devices when employed

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,170
you're wrong about being publicly

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,820
scholastic so before going to equate and

00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,850
what you can do to protect the device

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:07,110
engage with software that's the first

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:10,670
thing about devices from the actual

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,670
physical asset which is

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,830
Paul

00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,559
these are the me

00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,910
like

00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,769
[Music]

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:20,760
so we go

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:35,520
- one better

00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:35,520
we regret on the poor man

00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:48,670
but ladies

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:48,670
Lundy's elevator

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,369
