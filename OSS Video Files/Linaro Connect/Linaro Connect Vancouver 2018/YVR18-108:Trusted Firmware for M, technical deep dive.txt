Title: YVR18-108:Trusted Firmware for M, technical deep dive
Publication date: 2019-05-09
Playlist: Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018
Description: 
	Trusted Firmware M is an open source implementation of Platform Security Architecture(PSA) for ARM M profile processors. It was publicly launched in Linaro Connect HKG18. 
It offers-
 Trusted Boot – providing protection against malicious code injection on the device and secure firmware update
 Security isolation levels in the run-time – scope limiting system’s security critical resources and reducing the trusted code base
 Secure services – secure end points of the system providing service to other secure partitions and non-secure entities

This is an interactive session to deep dive into different technical aspects of TF-M and how these aspects bind to a connected device’s security model. An example use-case will also be presented to showcase how different components of the system firmware come together.
