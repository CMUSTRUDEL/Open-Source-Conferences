Title: YVR18-110:OpenSDK OE builds in MMWG
Publication date: 2019-05-09
Playlist: Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018
Description: 
	MMWG's OE builds serve two goals: to provide the baseline for linux development in MMWG, and to present the results of MMWG's work to the others.
The topics to be covered:
- build set-up, the OE layers by MMWG used in these builds, pre-built images published at snapshots.linaro.org
- the challenges in integrating machine-specific support for features like OP-TEE
- integrating Linaro OpenCDM into the builds; MMWG experience with browsers used to test OpenCDM with (Chromium, WPE browser)
- testing: from jenkins builds to testing in LAVA and displaying the results at qa-reports.linaro.org. What we need to improve to get more value from tests.

[Music]

00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:17,750
and Rekha no elephant I am an assignee

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:25,320
from Texas Instruments in the multimedia

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:30,259
working group one of my main activities

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,930
is maintaining open um but it builds for

00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:39,590
this group and this is mostly this

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,910
presentation is about it's not kind of

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,970
tutorial of how to use up a number it

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:55,680
but what we do with open and edit in or

00:00:44,970 --> 00:01:00,440
our working group mmm WG builds are

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,440
based on reference platform builds

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:09,590
since last connect the status of

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,990
reference platform bills has be changed

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:18,580
so this is more like a community effort

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:18,580
now and as long as people continue to

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:31,780
welcome them to submit their changes

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:34,490
they will continue to run and that's

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:41,690
perfectly fine for our working group so

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:53,380
we continue to use these builds as other

00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:56,170
places for ours we use one extra layer

00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:02,200
compared to reference patent bills

00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:07,700
metallurgy contains the components

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:11,209
developed in mm WG and those components

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,459
that are not in reference platform bills

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:19,360
but which I needed to get the features

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:19,360
we need in our bills

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:31,000
the bills are running in Jenkins and

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,000
they are published two snapshots

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:41,330
actually it's a question for me if

00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:45,410
someone uses the pre-built images we are

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:52,460
publishing for Derrick because my

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:58,370
feeling is that our bills are probably

00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:04,660
more useful for developers as set up

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:04,660
they can use for their development

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:17,710
maybe the pre-built images are not that

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:17,710
valuable but we need them anyway because

00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:26,090
this is the way to run the tests in lava

00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:32,780
and we submit the tests wire key reports

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:38,690
and this let us see the test results and

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:46,070
some statistics at query pots for the

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:51,770
moment we show only the statistics for

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:58,190
end results for the multi builds but I

00:03:51,770 --> 00:04:02,080
plan to add Rocko bills to be visible at

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,080
key reports as well

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:14,180
this is the matrix of all the builds we

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,180
are currently doing

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:30,030
we still actively use multi release and

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:33,360
also there are rocker bills and two

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:40,350
other bills which stand separately I'll

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:42,870
go to them in a while we only do Western

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:48,860
bills because we're not that interested

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:56,729
in excellent for example at least in the

00:04:48,860 --> 00:05:01,410
short term and the board's we use our G

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:09,389
is a 5 7 exact same dragon board foot

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:16,340
and see hiking and IMAX 8

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:24,800
we plan to edit shortly to our bills

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:30,060
most probably will start with Roku the

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:35,610
two other bills are our play Radian

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:40,260
these bills polarity is not publicly

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:47,460
available in source code so I cannot say

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:54,030
much about it and the last one is the

00:05:47,460 --> 00:06:03,020
build which has Westers and WP instead

00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:07,260
of Western and chromium it only supports

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:10,430
32-bit targets so that's why it's for

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,430
Heike 32-bit

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,150
summer builds

00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:32,770
we plan to edit some Dame but not in

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:37,550
short term because mostly the bigger

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:43,580
reason for that is because we use be

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:57,290
spoilers from the which probably support

00:06:43,580 --> 00:07:03,020
for the boats and for the CI and IMAX

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:11,620
eight boats we don't have releases for

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:15,080
summer yet as soon as they appear we can

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,660
start doing some bills as well for

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,740
example reference button builds have

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,740
some already

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:49,880
so as for that why we need a builds of

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:54,790
our own is because the area's multimedia

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:58,720
working group was focused on are about

00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,500
CDM and open Cydia in particular

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:06,070
security data path

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,900
implementation and this is what

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:19,370
reference platen builds don't have for

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:24,730
example so to work with the Syrians we

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:27,430
need a few key components like Weiland

00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:36,650
with the westerner Westeros as a

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:39,860
compositor option to test Open City and

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:49,940
we use browsers like chromium OWP

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:55,150
browser and the city implementation we

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:59,560
have in those bills is linear open CDM

00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,560
and also

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:14,000
we can we have polarity but it uses

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:16,839
protected it repository as it's not open

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,839
to the public

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:22,820
we also interested it in a hardware

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:30,920
accelerated video and this is again

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:42,139
again well and western and currently we

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:45,430
walk with de steamer there are boats

00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:55,000
which have everything required for

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:59,720
hardware acceleration in open source and

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,149
publicly available from github for

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,149
example this is the case of dragon boats

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:17,660
for a TI boat there are check has their

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:23,000
own open Ameri distribution which have

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:28,870
all the software required to enable

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,870
hardware acceleration on their board and

00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,260
we use

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,920
this in our builds and

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:57,760
one area we will start working on is up

00:10:53,530 --> 00:11:10,810
streaming the purchase used in GIS layer

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:14,740
for the streamer so we can use mm WG

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:26,260
builds as as a testbed for those pushes

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:31,090
as well actually I've talked about the

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:34,090
structure of metallurgy the previous

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:38,290
connect and there are no changes here

00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:43,290
it consists of three layers the most

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:50,380
important one being metallurgy layer

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:55,540
this is where the software mm WG walks

00:11:50,380 --> 00:12:00,220
on live this is here is the chromium

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:04,350
dependent which enables open CDM for

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,350
chromium and

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:14,920
CDMA and the option implementation which

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:19,580
is needed for open CDM there are also

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,820
images which include open Cydia or in

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,820
case of

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:35,730
w be sorry there are images with

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:42,990
chromium and open CDM and image which

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:52,020
has WP lives in its own layer which is

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:56,190
the last one listed here also sometimes

00:12:52,020 --> 00:13:00,290
it's not possible to use third-party

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:03,870
layers directly when we need support for

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:06,560
some for example for hardware

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:12,270
acceleration for some of the boats and

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:16,950
in this case we have to just to pull the

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:20,550
recep's from vendors layers into our

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,590
bill into our layer and this is a

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,160
separate layer which is called

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,160
metallurgy integration

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:38,140
in the ideal world this layer should not

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:42,149
be used but and we tried to keep it as

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,149
small as possible but it's not empty

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:12,840
as we use object CDMS we need the boats

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:17,190
which have of the support usable for us

00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:22,110
and at the moment this is only one boat

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:27,120
hiking its most likely actively used at

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:30,060
the moment the disadvantage is that its

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,740
outer production and it's not easy to

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:41,810
get one so we are considering moving to

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:41,810
other boats which supports opium

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:54,690
there are two of them available right

00:14:50,490 --> 00:15:00,330
now am five-seven xxe beam has a

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:04,560
high-security ocean the problem with

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:12,390
this boat is that all the sources are

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:15,630
publicly available but to build an image

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:22,230
which could be used on a high-security

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:24,570
board one need one needs to have the

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,510
security tools to sign the images and to

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:33,540
create them and these tools are not

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:42,950
publicly available for this reason we

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:46,610
cannot do builds in Jenkins and without

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,610
the images

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:59,029
we couldn't run tests in lower I'm not

00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:01,370
sure if it would be okay to upload

00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:06,080
images manually but anyway this is not

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:13,310
what we are looking to implement this I

00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:17,089
hope so the annex piece mx8 mode looks

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:21,830
more promising in this sense it has an

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:30,080
SDP implementation already but not for

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:36,709
Linux and adding this boat mmw build

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:41,899
season progress until this is done

00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:46,580
the developers use the 0 LS release for

00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:51,830
I'm excited which is available from an

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:55,130
XP and it's completely open just it it's

00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:58,570
not a pre based based it's based on an

00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,570
expert on distribution

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:18,110
so far as we have as I had only high

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:26,120
keyboards with abscissa port and the

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:36,200
builds until now we didn't face a kind

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:39,549
of problem with observations so the left

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,770
column for high key shows what

00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:46,640
observations are supported in a meta up

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:53,919
to layer which is used for example

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:59,419
reference platform bills as well and the

00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:03,500
opportunities there are not very recent

00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:09,770
they correspond to the current release

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:13,429
of obscene at the time when the

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:19,940
corresponding reference button built was

00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:23,169
set up and if we see if we look at the

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:28,490
vendors open America stirs and check the

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:33,919
observations there we will see that the

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:43,220
situation where eyes depending on what

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:46,070
when the we are looking at GI the attack

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:53,660
have met Erica distro and from Watchi

00:18:46,070 --> 00:19:00,860
they use to 6:04 rocker they use pretty

00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:02,230
recent 3.1 release and in case of a max

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,850
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:12,750
up to version 3.0 is used for both more

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:19,320
general but actually it's not the

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:23,679
general releases and both TI and nxp

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:32,230
edit some patches on top of what was

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:35,799
released in general in case of TI the

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:40,600
difference turns up to be pretty small

00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:44,080
and as far as I could see for rocket

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:48,850
they use just a snapshot of leaners

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:52,270
3 even though they have a repository of

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:56,799
their own for option I speak about

00:19:52,270 --> 00:20:01,809
objects in this particular case and an

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:07,150
expedite more changes to option actually

00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:08,080
one of those changes surprised me quite

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:13,000
a bit

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:17,460
the first changed to matter sorry to

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,940
obvious code was to remove most of

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:25,740
copyright text from there I'm not sure

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,740
why this was done much

00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:41,120
so if you look at those versions it's

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:46,270
pretty obvious that we that it hard if

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:52,480
not even possible to have these versions

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,480
these exact versions in a single build

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:11,900
so when while we are adding I am excited

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:16,090
to our builds

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:21,170
I plan to experiment with observations

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:25,460
and I successes I hope that using just

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:31,130
their recent enough observation would be

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:34,910
ok for all the boats I would do my best

00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:40,370
to avoid using different object Ares for

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:49,430
BOTS in simple build I just don't see

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:56,330
any advantages of doing that maybe I

00:21:49,430 --> 00:22:00,210
will have to keep the patches for

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:04,620
I'm excited for example separately but I

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:09,950
would like to have the common base for

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,950
op C in for all the boats in one build

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:33,840
I think that last connects we already

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:44,100
moved rocker builds to chromium version

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:48,960
65 and this was using the work done by

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:53,389
golly why version 53 specialist that

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:56,269
this is the last version which used deep

00:22:53,389 --> 00:23:01,679
building system and after this version

00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:07,409
all the all the version past 53 don't

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,509
have give support and open embedded meta

00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:14,240
browser open buried layer didn't have

00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:21,320
support fujian for quite a while it was

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:30,130
added for x11 builds and

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:33,350
I think by in tone and for Weyland

00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:43,400
it was a courier who did most of the

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:48,250
work and we use their recite with some

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:54,430
minor modifications actually Galia

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:56,800
updated the Wayland chromium reside in

00:23:54,430 --> 00:24:01,160
upstream at the browser but it uses

00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:04,400
version 64 which didn't quite worked for

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:07,820
me and I tried the next version and it

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:17,960
works fine so that's why we use version

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:23,710
65 in the rocker bills what I'm not

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,710
happy with is that AB Demeter browser

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:33,740
has the excellent recept

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:37,610
updated regularly like every week or two

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:40,010
so the exelon reside for chromium is

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:43,730
up-to-date and uses a recent Crowe

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:46,700
memories but for chromium as well as on

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:55,180
Wendell Weiland the recite nothing

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:55,180
changed since December 2017

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:10,110
I've actually posted a patch to meet a

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:12,720
browser updating Chrome OS on Wayland

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:17,850
for most more recent to version quite

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:25,580
some time ago maybe more than half a

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:30,809
year ago maybe even earlier and I

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:34,049
mentioned that this is mostly gallier

00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:39,270
work which I'm posting and the eagerly

00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:43,799
replied and they said that they do plan

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:49,760
to update chromosome Wayland residing at

00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:49,760
a browser but this didn't happen

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,850
but eagerly is still actively working on

00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:01,280
chromium ozone Wayland they use it for

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:07,030
their own development and they have met

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,030
a browser met a browser layer which have

00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:21,980
the chromium reset for Russian 70 if I

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:27,200
recall correctly so we could follow

00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:31,160
their work as well it's just a pity that

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,790
they didn't find the time to upstream

00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:39,050
their meta browser work and we can just

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:43,450
use what they provide in them at the

00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:47,270
browser layer and they also publish

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:53,870
chromium troubles with their

00:26:47,270 --> 00:27:02,440
modifications for Wayland at least twice

00:26:53,870 --> 00:27:05,480
a month so the recent chromium for

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,650
Wayland is available it's just not in

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,650
upstream metal browser

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,530
being more close to the current release

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:27,430
of chromium has the obvious obvious

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:32,800
advantage of getting some recent

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:41,710
additions like HD support in mm WG

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:46,510
builds what changed since the worst

00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:50,740
connect is that we finally put it

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:57,640
forward our open city and solution from

00:27:50,740 --> 00:28:01,180
chromium version 53 to 65 it was mostly

00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:09,490
about updating open CDM to uses a gen

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:19,830
build system and to account for changes

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:19,830
in CDM code in chromium itself so now we

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:29,230
we just keep her open CDM in sync with

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,220
changes done two chromium's clear key

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:36,690
CDM implementation and it currently uses

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:42,490
CDM version 8

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:46,710
so version line so it's not them most

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,710
using but quite close

00:28:51,500 --> 00:29:02,210
due to that changes in CDM

00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:06,110
implementation chromium we've created a

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:12,260
separate branch for open sodium which

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:17,020
would work with chromium version 65 if

00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,020
you look at open content

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:36,359
so if you look at the open Cydia

00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:41,479
repository at you know mm WG accounts in

00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:45,269
github there are branches they named

00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:54,559
which names has the exact conversion

00:29:45,269 --> 00:30:02,759
that are intended to walk with the 65

00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:07,649
the 65th version currently missus recent

00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:16,529
addition additions to version 53 these

00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:19,410
are a unification with the WP the

00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:28,830
significant means that

00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:31,710
the same code could be used to build the

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:43,220
open city library for both chromium and

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:43,220
WEP browser and open open CDM for

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:57,440
version 53 also supports player ad and I

00:30:51,950 --> 00:31:02,130
haven't voted it forward to version 65

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,490
and the main reasons that I don't have

00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:10,110
access to boy polarity sources and I

00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,900
just could not verify if the forward

00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:17,460
port is done correctly or not

00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:20,490
so this adding in clarity is one of the

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,480
to-do items for Open City and for

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,480
version 65

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:39,810
the builds and Jenkins has already took

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:42,690
this change so we now we have open Cydia

00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:44,600
enabled for high key in Rocko builds as

00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,690
well

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:54,630
the materials will continue using chrome

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:56,400
version 53 mostly because they might be

00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:02,840
here some work which depends on this

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:06,920
particular version and breaking it

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,920
wouldn't make any sense

00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:20,020
so that to-do list for open Cydia for

00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:25,020
crema version 65 with Eden Prairie

00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:31,120
supports booting forward unification

00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:38,190
with WP browser and there is a feature

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:42,280
that the 53 of the open sitting plugin

00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:44,980
which would make it possible to build

00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,200
debug version of the plug-in while

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,500
building a release version of Chrome

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,110
omits this is quite useful for debugging

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:57,640
has built in the back question of

00:32:53,110 --> 00:33:00,309
chromium is not the easiest way to work

00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:03,990
the resulting in which would be quite

00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:08,610
huge and it would be not easy to use it

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:13,120
but due to changes in the built

00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:19,299
procedure this change cannot be moved as

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:22,809
is to Gen built and that's why this

00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:29,289
feature disappeared while updating to

00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:35,970
version 65 reading reading it would be a

00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:35,970
good thing so this is to do list

00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:53,270
I can't say much about Westeros WP bill

00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:59,240
status other than that there is a

00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:59,240
Jenkins built for this configuration and

00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:15,170
it's not building at the moment so I

00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,170
mean process of updating it and

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:24,200
hopefully it will be working soon again

00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:45,010
4wp there is a more recent WP has

00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:49,300
support for a more recent version of

00:34:45,010 --> 00:35:00,220
amid morrison then version zero that

00:34:49,300 --> 00:35:05,470
fine be and in mmm WG we do walk with a

00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:10,830
me version three but it needs more work

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:10,830
to get it enabled enter mmm WG bills

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:39,690
I can't say that we have a fully

00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:43,040
operational operational say loop for our

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:46,800
open variables but what here is that

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:50,760
there are built for both Marty and Rocco

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:56,910
which run periodically three times a

00:35:50,760 --> 00:36:03,210
week and the images build submitted for

00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:10,490
testing in lower just we don't have all

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:10,490
the target boats in love at the moment

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:21,270
we can use high kiss and for Howie we do

00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:25,670
submit testing jobs dragon boats should

00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,670
be available as well

00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:35,239
the thing is that for our tests we need

00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:47,339
the boats in allow it to be connected to

00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:50,970
some kind of HDMI monitor or dummy

00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:59,249
dongle which simulates the presence of

00:36:50,970 --> 00:37:03,749
HDMI monitor and we it's not strictly

00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:10,710
required but it's easy if Mouse is also

00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:16,230
connected not all the boats have is

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:19,440
diamond angles connected so not every

00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:26,160
board in love in lava is okay for our

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:33,960
testing there are dragon boats in lab we

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:40,200
don't use them at the moment and it

00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:47,480
might have sense to use them for our

00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:51,480
tests as well the thing is that we don't

00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,430
have anything special in our builds for

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:58,470
dragon boats so we can use them mostly

00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:04,859
for sanity testing as reference platform

00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:12,180
bills and the builds which cocoon

00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:14,009
landing team is doing they have all we

00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:18,380
have for dragon boats and our bills we

00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:18,380
don't have any edit value'

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:36,510
the last a mix sorry you know 5 7 xx

00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:39,090
idioms should be available in lava they

00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,700
are mostly used for Android testing I

00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:46,320
think and we haven't considered using

00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:49,230
them for our testing yet but probably

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:55,040
this would make a sense to try using

00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:58,680
them as well I'm excited boats are not

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:02,640
in full enabled in lower yet they are

00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:06,990
present and the work to make them

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:11,930
available our in low is underway but

00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:16,610
there are still some problems due to

00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:22,050
firmware for those boats so they are not

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:24,300
yet fully functional in Laur but quite

00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:29,310
possible that by the time we will read

00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:32,970
I'm excited to our builds these boats

00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:37,040
will be fully operational a person of 11

00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:37,040
then we should use them

00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:57,850
here is the list of the tests we run for

00:39:49,270 --> 00:40:05,580
OPI we use standard X test we also do a

00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:09,250
test for internal support in the Western

00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:16,870
just because chromium would not work if

00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:19,840
in jail doesn't talk we also have few

00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:30,220
tests for just dreamer which is playing

00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:32,770
a video file in in the tests we submit

00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:37,030
from the Jenkins that we only have one

00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:39,340
test case in manual testing we also have

00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:44,230
an option to use software decoding our

00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:49,420
hardware accelerated decoding but anyway

00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:52,210
it's not a comprehensive test for just

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:58,720
you just basically one test case or one

00:40:52,210 --> 00:41:02,800
use case for chromium the tests for

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:07,000
chromium also regenerate from manual

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:11,320
tests that's why there are just three

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,050
simple test cases except for us just

00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:19,080
that in the browser we also have played

00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:19,080
a video from YouTube

00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:31,490
webgl test which uses an example from a

00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:39,910
3GS or website and we have EEMA test

00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:47,830
which records a video using clear King

00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:52,780
and authorship from our working group

00:41:47,830 --> 00:42:01,490
created to test test definition which

00:41:52,780 --> 00:42:04,270
uses open CV to recognize the image when

00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:10,390
our video is playing back and it uses it

00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:13,390
as a criteria if the tests is okay or

00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,390
failed

00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:32,809
but again this is just a few use cases

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:32,809
which doesn't explicitly test every

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:51,040
protocol flow of of CDM and every API so

00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:56,070
we definitely need some in front in some

00:42:51,040 --> 00:43:03,280
enhancements in how we do testing the

00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:15,580
low-hanging fruit is that builds and

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:24,090
baselines did kind of simple job we can

00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:27,070
use to enable to trigger a build when a

00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:33,400
commit is done to open cydia or open

00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:38,350
cydia my this will this needs to be a

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:42,130
bit revoked because it was created when

00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:45,280
we have only one branch and one version

00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:50,620
of open CDM now we have separate

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:55,150
versions for chromium version 53 and 665

00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:59,380
and we will need two different triggers

00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:02,490
for that we need to filter the changes

00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:05,100
which happen to

00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:11,010
they get repositories that really is

00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:18,180
looking for but this could be done in a

00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:22,320
week or so we need more tests more

00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:32,210
comprehensive tests like this to

00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:32,210
validate for the streamer and there is

00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:47,270
just inside chromium source tree and

00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:52,320
open Cydia has its own version of this

00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:57,540
test set but it doesn't correspond to

00:44:52,320 --> 00:45:00,660
the current version 65 of their browser

00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,820
and of the chromium browser and open CDM

00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:06,600
plug-in so it needs to be updated and

00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:13,619
then we could try using it this would

00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:18,270
let us share the wall implementation of

00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:25,770
open sodium CDM instead of just one

00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:30,570
particular use case another side of the

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:34,800
problem is that if you look at the test

00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:41,190
results at key reports they are not very

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:49,850
easy to compare and there is a

00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:49,850
possibility to use kind of

00:45:50,320 --> 00:46:04,570
filters so there is a way to show

00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:09,440
graphically the changes between builds

00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:13,790
one is interested in there is such a

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:20,510
possibility in clear pots we don't use

00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:22,780
it yet and this is what is worth looking

00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,780
at

00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:38,490
from the harbor point there is a new

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:42,960
more or less new device by Google which

00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:47,430
which is called chameleon and it can be

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,869
used to verify the actual output signal

00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:54,900
which comes to the HDMI connector

00:46:50,869 --> 00:47:04,230
instead of taking the screenshot from

00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:07,619
the web driver for chromium like we

00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:11,910
currently do so this is not another way

00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:17,030
to enhance the courage and this is

00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:17,030
another option to consider me

00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:36,380
so I think this is all I have as almost

00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:44,090
elegy women if it's has the instructions

00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:46,910
on how to do the build so if someone is

00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:53,360
going to reproduce those bills this is

00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:55,690
the way to start looking from so any

00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,690
questions

00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:15,060
either no questions you can consider

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:18,760
this session done thank you

00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,760
[Applause]

00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,820
