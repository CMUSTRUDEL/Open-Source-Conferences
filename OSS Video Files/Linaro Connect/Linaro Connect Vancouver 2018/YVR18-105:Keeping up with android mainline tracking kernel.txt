Description: 
	android-mainline-tracking kernel is an effort to provide a reference or experimental Android preview tree to member partners for their upcoming SoCs. It also help find/report/fix Android regressions or ABI breakages in upstream kernel.

This short presentation will cover the recent changes in Android patchset as we move closer to the next LTS release. For example: eBPF replacing netfilter qtaguid, clang LTO and CFI support, dropped FIQ debugger and other legacy patches/workarounds, experimental/eas-dev tracking tree, Google's upstream first approach et al.
