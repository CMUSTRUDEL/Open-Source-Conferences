Title: LTD20-200K Keynote: Trusted Firmware – Build Security Collaboratively
Publication date: 2020-04-01
Playlist: Linaro Tech Days 2020
Description: 
	Description: 
In a world of a trillion connected devices, Firmware security must be seen as a shared responsibility across different market segments, from Cloud to IoT. Trusted Firmware is an open governance community project, providing a collaborative platform for everyone in the ecosystem to work together on open source reference implementations of Secure world Software & Firmware on the Arm architecture, for both resource-constrained Microcontrollers and powerful Application Processors.
In this talk Matteo and Shebu will present the latest exciting news from the project, showing the constantly increased community engagement and discussing both recent updates and forward-looking plans for Trusted Firmware, as the comprehensive reference implementation for secure world software and secure services on Arm systems.

well thank you everyone for joining

00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,330
thanks to Lynne ro for hosting this

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,490
remote session despite the situation I'm

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,250
at a colony I'm the director of software

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,300
technology management at arm in the open

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,570
source software group

00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,640
I am Shifu crea cous I am also one of

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,670
the technology managers in the open

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,100
source software group today we are here

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,279
to represent the trust a film edit org

00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,989
open governance community project

00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:35,090
so we're we've asked for the next 25

00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:38,180
minutes we're gonna give you few updates

00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,610
and all the exciting news around the

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:45,500
project and trust us there are a lot of

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:48,350
good news so let's start we have a slide

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,930
full of headlines so these are all

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,630
headlines which made the news in the

00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,969
past couple of years regarding security

00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,280
vulnerabilities you might recognize some

00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,160
of them in the middle very popular ones

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,410
but the key point I would like to make

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,810
is that there are all sort of

00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:09,470
vulnerabilities across all the possible

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:12,250
devices which we interact with every day

00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,520
in our life there are I you T devices

00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:19,580
cameras smartphones cloud services as

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,760
well as cars can be autonomous cars on

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,100
also the traditional manual cars so this

00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,729
is a very generic slide but if we go a

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,189
bit more indeed and we see the film were

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:35,869
vulnerabilities that are extracted from

00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:38,900
the NIST vulnerability database you can

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:41,780
see that fumer is increasingly becoming

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,750
the preferred target for all the attacks

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,540
across all the systems so this is a

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,840
picture over the last 20 years and you

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,320
will see the increase so why that so

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,689
there are many reasons for this increase

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,970
one could think about operating system

00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,970
kernels applications that are getting

00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,759
more robust connectivity protocols that

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,670
are implementing new features and new

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,129
handshake mechanism so the attackers are

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,099
trying to target lower in the stack and

00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:14,809
they are reaching up to the humor but

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,239
the other important reason the key

00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:19,790
reason for me is that the field

00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,569
is the highest privileged piece of

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:26,090
software in all our devices higher

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:30,019
privilege than any kernel than any

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:34,030
hypervisor so effectively if you own the

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:36,980
firmware on a device you own the device

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,760
but don't be afraid don't be scared

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,849
there is hope there is always hope and

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:48,220
we strongly believe that the hope must

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:51,670
be built on top of collaboration

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,709
sure if I can move this right

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,680
collaboration collaboration because

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,349
security challenges are complex think

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,650
about spectrum so how long would it take

00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:06,050
to properly understand what the spectra

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,599
attack is really about and how long did

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,590
it take to the industry to react to

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,930
spectra and find the proper security

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,260
workarounds for the spectra attacks but

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,640
it's also a security by scale problem so

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,920
if you look at the right side of the

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,830
picture these are all the industry

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,470
bundles from the IOT market in 2019

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,560
so it's really an economy by scale

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:33,769
exercise we need to develop security

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,280
fixes that can be deployed and applied

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:39,400
across the wall ecosystem and this can

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,450
only be done from our point of view

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:47,720
through click too much click through

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,510
collaborations because collaboration is

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,959
the key to solve the complexity of the

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,450
security problems and we need to create

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,569
one solution in one single place that

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:03,769
solve the security challenges once and

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:06,650
for all for all the ecosystem and that's

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:09,350
the main reason why we created trusted

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,930
fear more as a platform as a community

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,160
platform to build security in a

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:19,079
collaborative way so trusted filmer is

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,389
an open governance community project

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,699
provides a reference implementation all

00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,819
open source of the secular world

00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:29,430
software for ARM processors and non

00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,250
based platforms across all the market

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,099
segments it's open governance in the

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,729
sense that its membership is open to all

00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:41,759
and the governance is transparent and is

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:44,129
overseen by two main bodies on the left

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,680
side you will see the board of directors

00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:49,229
from the project members which decides

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,990
on the strategic direction and financial

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,699
direction of the project and on the

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,069
right side you see the technical

00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:00,870
steering committee which decides on the

00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:02,909
technical direction so how is the

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,180
collaboration going because we talk

00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:08,610
about collaboration well I would say

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,699
it's going pretty well so this is a

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,129
visual representation of the external

00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:17,610
contributions that we see coming into

00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:19,710
the project from the ecosystem so this

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,190
is a count of the contributions that are

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,930
not from arm but are from the ecosystem

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:28,650
over time since the beginning of the

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,800
project so we take as a starting point

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,409
2013 when arm trusted firmware was

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,449
launched now it's not called on trust a

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:39,360
few more anymore now it's called trust a

00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:42,779
few more a or PFA for friends or the

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,879
application processor initially clearly

00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:47,759
the contribution was set to zero when we

00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,389
started and then slowly over time

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,060
contribution started to increase in 2016

00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:57,300
the first improvement we removed all the

00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,180
legal paperwork and the need for having

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:04,949
a signed CLA in place for being able to

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,500
contribute so since then since 25th 16

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,960
we accept all contributions under the

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,449
terms of the CEO and the license has

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,180
always been a permissive bsd free clause

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:18,930
license and then continuous improvement

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,150
up until two years ago 2018 with the

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,120
launch of trusted few more and for all

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,690
the microcontroller space few months

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,149
later in the autumn of 2018 with six

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,400
founding members we launched the trustee

00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:35,790
mandatory community project

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,570
and the increase of collaboration

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:42,900
continued up until last September 2019

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:46,520
in San Diego sunny San Diego back at the

00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,740
time we were all available to travel so

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,850
we announced that opt was also joined in

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,949
trusted firm work to continue the

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,570
collaboration and to enlarge the family

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,199
of projects which are part of Joseph's

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,419
rhema.org so in terms of contributions

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,030
only taking into account the last couple

00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:09,090
of years there has been an increase of

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,690
more than 120 percent our contributions

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,970
with Peaks that reaches help of the

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,930
contributions coming from external

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:22,110
partners versus arm in specific time

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,060
time periods so it's really going well

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,790
it's really a classic story about

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,160
collaboration

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,050
but we are now stopping here the family

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,900
is expanding the framing of projects

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,880
being part of trust agreement org so we

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,300
are very very pleased to announce today

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:45,030
that hafnium is joining the trusted

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:48,190
VMware project so now what is happening

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,890
hafnium is a project that was originally

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,950
started by Google by the Google Android

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,930
security team arm and Google have been

00:07:53,950 --> 00:08:00,010
collaborating around half noon for the

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,590
past couple of years hafnium comes into

00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:06,730
trust a firmer as a reference secure

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:10,270
partition manager for the systems which

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:13,120
implements the arm a dot for secure l2

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,010
virtualization extension and that's on

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,190
the application processor and talking

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,690
about the application processor site

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:23,890
hafnium comes with a minimal code base

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,510
so we very reduced attacks or pace it

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,440
enforces the principle of least

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:32,290
privilege and it adds an extra layer to

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,400
the defense in deaths concepts on our

00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:39,430
transient software space and in terms of

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,400
use cases it enables the isolation of

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:46,750
one of multiple trusted execution

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:49,510
instances running behind tri-zone so if

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:53,380
we look at a picture so here on the left

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:55,450
side it's a traditional system which are

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,760
not secure el2

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,330
enabled so these are not a dot for

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,860
systems and we are transitioning towards

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,670
system like this in which above trust a

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,860
few marae

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,250
there is hafnium SPN which allows

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,350
multiple trusted execution environments

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,810
there is a link to the initial code base

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,510
into TF note org and the other good news

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,090
is that Hofmann is joining with the same

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,430
licensing scheme as the rest of the

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:29,730
trusted humor project so they're missive

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:32,670
BSD license so let's have a

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,350
I look deeper look at the software

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,010
architecture that we are now building

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:41,220
then on the application processor side

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,680
on the a-class processors so on the

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,010
picture you will see all the blue boxes

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,410
will be provided as a reference open

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,709
source from the joseph emulator project

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,209
so starting from the el3 runtime VMware

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,990
which is the traditional trust a few

00:09:54,209 --> 00:10:01,230
more a going above hafnium SPM running

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:04,079
at SEL 2 and on top we provide the

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,750
reference even by up T as a trusted OS

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,240
will be some trusted applications on top

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,850
which may also implement es a security

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,610
services and then partners and liquor

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,310
system can implement their own specific

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,670
trust addresses they are on specific

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,949
platform services which are all isolated

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,850
one another thanks to the virtualization

00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:28,139
extension so we are really achieving

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,079
isolation from virtualization in the

00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,750
second world and the other point I would

00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,540
like to stress is that trusted VMware

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,819
all these components will implement all

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,389
the standard interfaces which are

00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:45,060
defined by the arm PS a filmer framework

00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:48,750
for the a-class which is most friendly

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,449
known as the S PCI interface this is

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,779
really key because we strongly believe

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:59,130
that the key for a smooth transition

00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:00,569
into more secure feel more space goes

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,029
through the standardization of the

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,069
interfaces between the normal world and

00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,290
the second word we strongly encourage

00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:09,630
our partners to adopt a standard

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,720
interface is defined in the NPS a

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,670
framework with all of that we would be

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,310
able to achieve defragmentation

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:22,350
of the security or more space both the

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:25,709
DL 3 and an SEM 2 and what we gained out

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,740
of that is easy easy integration for our

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:31,620
partners the testing processes provide

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,800
the way for updating the firmware in a

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,620
standard way which again is useful to

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,649
fix the film of vulnerabilities in field

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,690
and we ease the process of auditing and

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:47,410
security assessment of devices

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,160
so eventually I move this thing around

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,890
again

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,850
we increase the security of our devices

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,440
and we achieve film and transparency

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,510
ultimately reducing the time to market

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,500
and the development cost for the entire

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:16,780
ecosystem and with that passing over to

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:20,610
shabu for the continuation hi everyone

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,610
hope you can see my screen now

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:46,070
now we can hire one I would like to get

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,590
started by briefly mentioning about

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,650
trusted from where M which is one of the

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,440
projects in the trusted form a dot org

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:57,680
project portfolio trusted former M

00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,250
provides a secure processing environment

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:06,350
for cortex-m devices that today powers

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:08,630
millions of IOT endpoints and embedded

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,840
applications it is the reference

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:14,870
implementation of the platform security

00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,900
architecture and it provides a secure

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,390
boot that authenticates the runtime

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,690
images and it provides a standard set of

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:26,270
runtime secure services such as storage

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:31,160
group to an attestation that's made

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:33,650
available to the standard PC api's the

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,500
TFM project has been launched for the

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:39,980
last two years and in the last two years

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:44,060
it has come a long way for example it is

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:47,930
provided as the root of trust for a long

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,910
list of silicon platforms and artosis to

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,180
be PC certified under the PC

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,710
certification program the project

00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:00,530
started off by supporting a bunch of

00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,410
reference platforms and now the

00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:05,720
supported platforms are in the increase

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,760
starting off with the pipe Cypress

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,760
boishakh 64 which is now supported

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,210
upstream in T FM and that is active work

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:18,440
going on to upstream more e8m platforms

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:21,770
such as the NX b LPC 55 and STS stm32 l5

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,690
the project is also starting to

00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,870
integrate with a lot of open source

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,760
artosis so early on in 2019 we started

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,150
off with integrating with M Badou is

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:34,580
followed by C fair and later on in 2019

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,800
we started integrating with the Amazon

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,390
free our toes and our three thread

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,170
and the aim by providing such an

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:44,810
ecosystem of TFM on different silicon's

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:47,899
and on operating systems is to provide

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:51,050
IOT application till their developers to

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:54,620
avail security services from trusted

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:59,720
firmware em thereby making IOT endpoints

00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:01,880
more secure and I'm glad to say during

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:07,160
this month the project is achieving a

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:10,670
great milestone by providing the TFM 1.0

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:14,180
release tank so this is a culmination of

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,970
the work from the TSM ecosystem over the

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,459
last two years to implement and align to

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,250
all of almost all the PSC specifications

00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:25,209
means it's mostly around 1.2 meeting all

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,920
the PSC certification requirement and

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:31,010
thereby being the root of trust for a

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,990
large variety of cortex-m devices and I

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,839
would say this is just the beginning and

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,940
there is still an exciting roadmap ahead

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,920
for this project for example providing

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,670
different event profiles for different

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,670
memory configurations supporting a lot

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:50,570
of v8n platforms except or etcetera so I

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:53,390
would say what's the space now we've

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,730
briefly looked at a few T trusted

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:59,000
firmware projects that ensure security

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:02,450
in n devices but nowadays most of these

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,920
devices also needs to establish secure

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:10,820
links to say connect to cloud or any

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,500
other end applications MB TLS has been

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,959
an extensively used

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,750
TLS library to provide secure

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,820
authenticated and encrypted connection

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:25,100
over unreliable networks what the TLS

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:29,240
library basically does is abstract away

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:32,209
all the cryptographic certification

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,190
management and authentication complicity

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:37,010
that's associated with the TLS protocol

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,890
away from the application and so far the

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,500
Amba TLS project was available under the

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:46,459
arm github as an open-source project and

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,800
today I am glad to announce that the MBT

00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:50,720
Ellis project is transitioning to become

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,629
a trusted format org

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,930
open governance project and this move is

00:16:53,629 --> 00:17:00,170
being made with the sole aim to take

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,990
this project even to be a far well

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,179
adopted community project where the

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,100
strategic and technical direction of the

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:10,669
project is true and by the trusted forum

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,530
where dot-org members the project

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:15,409
continues to be available under the

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:18,319
Apache 2 license and today if you go to

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:21,829
the trusted former dot orc website we

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,870
have gone life with a new ambit Aeolus

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,209
mailing list that would be a good

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,700
starting point for the entire ecosystem

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:34,789
to collaborate on future enhancements on

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:37,120
the MBT LS project one of the associated

00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:39,320
activities that has been happening with

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,450
ambit in my peerless over the last

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,059
several months has been to Spacek elisa

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,940
Plitt the embedded TLS project into two

00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:50,150
halves the ember TLS project providing

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,960
all the TLS network security aspect and

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:56,169
the x4 509 management while the second

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,400
part of the project called PSA clip to

00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:00,770
providing bringing together all the

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,559
crypto primitives in the ambit Els

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:07,789
library and making it accessible through

00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:09,950
a big set of PSA crypto api's this

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,470
second project has been proven by the

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,860
platform security architecture program

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,340
aiming to provide a crypto library that

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:23,030
devices can use for different purposes

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,370
such as securing the valuable assets in

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:28,330
their system to establish secure

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:32,539
connections and to securely provide

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:35,270
secure updates to the end platforms for

00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:37,190
example usage model on a codex a or

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,440
cortex-m devices as shown on the right

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,620
hand side of the screen would be the PSA

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,960
crypto library being on the trusted

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,590
execution environment or the secure

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,640
world and applications or MB TLS for

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:55,570
that matter can avail cryptographic

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,610
functionality from the script basic tape

00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:02,090
library through a standard set of PC

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:04,220
api's in addition to the developer

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,070
facing API and the project is also

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,500
to define a set of low-level API seats

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:12,620
that would enable the library to

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,480
interface with a huge array of secure

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,669
elements and accelerators

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,400
I'd say the project is still in its

00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:22,159
infancy that's a long way to go but we

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,460
have in the recent months seen a lot of

00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,440
momentum in silicon vendors trying to

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,530
adopt this library because it brings

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,260
standardization along these API so it

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:37,240
like requests you to have a look into

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,240
this project under trusted format or org

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,179
now very quickly we have gone through a

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:46,520
bunch of project that trusted from a.org

00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:49,460
today host so traditionally it has been

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,860
a hosting place for TFA and opti which

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,950
together so far has provided the trusted

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:58,370
execution environment for cortex a

00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,260
devices with the advent of hafnium it is

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,500
going to provide a sec your hypervisor

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,690
for future codecs a devices dirham of

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,570
course provides the secure processing

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:11,210
environment for cortex-m devices the

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,360
MPLS project ensuring you can establish

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,090
secure connections from these endpoints

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,809
BSA crypto providing to library with

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:22,789
some standard basic to api's so we truly

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:24,860
believe that trusted former dot org is

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:28,760
providing that collaborative platform

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:32,750
with a complete and coherent set of open

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:36,700
source secure software solutions that

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:39,919
can be deployed across the arm ecosystem

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,250
now that we have looked at the different

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,409
project that div dot org hosts today I

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,240
would like to briefly touch upon how

00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,880
does the project operate so estimate he

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,429
was saying earlier on it has got a board

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,929
which sets the strategic direction of

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:55,610
the project and the technical steering

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,169
committee is responsible for the

00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,600
technical direction of the project the

00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:03,919
code base the maintainer ship and the

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,130
different technical topics and during

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:10,549
2018 and during 2019 we had all these

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,830
great members collaborating

00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:15,200
under the clustered former dot org board

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,620
and the technical steering committee to

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,260
lead these different projects in term

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:23,770
of strategic direction and the technical

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,380
direction and we have got new members

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,559
joining the project as well and today

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:33,250
I'm very glad to announce that renesis

00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:37,330
and nxp is joining bustard from a dot

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:40,990
org as its latest Platinum members we

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:44,200
are sure that with the huge experience

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:47,110
and expertise that we nieces and nxb has

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,140
over the years in creating armies secure

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:53,950
devices it will be a huge value and for

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,470
for the project for these two companies

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,540
to work on the trusted format or to set

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:03,730
the future direction of the project

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:05,710
so welcome renesis and nxb as we come to

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,170
the close of this session I would like

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,270
to quickly go through what is the

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,580
collaboration on a day to day basis as

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,620
far as the project goes so there are as

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,510
we talked about during the keynote all

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:20,200
along it's all around open collaboration

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:22,059
so any new idea starts coming up through

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,670
the mailing list so or two each of these

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:26,530
projects have got its own mailing list a

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,510
lot of people are registered to it and

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,100
now it's becoming a very busy place

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,890
where there are a lot of conversations

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,120
around new designs and problems that

00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,160
people are facing once they are

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,920
deploying these projects in in devices

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,320
then we are starting to have bi-weekly

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,750
open tech forums which is normally

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,510
attended by 40 to 50 people for each of

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,940
these areas where main technical topics

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,130
are brought up by key experts and these

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,220
are presented and then a follow-up

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,770
discussions are being held we are also

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,570
starting to have a annual workshop for

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,300
some of the key project area so it

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:05,260
started off with a TFM workshop back in

00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,230
October in Leon which had around 36

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,710
people attending a two-day workshop

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:13,450
discussing quite a lot of heat TFM

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,790
technical topics and be hope once the

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,160
travel restrictions are lifted we can

00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,440
have similar workshop for other projects

00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,360
as well in the coming years so once

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,570
these design ideas are formed of the

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,730
patches comes in the toasted format or

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,290
get it for open reviews giving a chance

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,149
for everyone to have a look at the code

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,940
and review the code and one

00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:36,609
it's all gone through the review cycle

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,700
it finally gets hosted in the interest

00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:41,229
rate from a.org get from there on it's

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,830
available through it is open source

00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:47,440
licenses for conception to end devices

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:50,259
and to complete the cycle we are also

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,269
starting to have a open test system

00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:54,549
which we call it trusted firmware open

00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:56,409
CI which is available in this link where

00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:59,559
we are trying to make sure that all the

00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:01,599
member platforms are always tested and

00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:04,659
up to the mark with the latest code

00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:07,839
bases for each of these project so by

00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:10,809
starting the design it starts out in the

00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:13,599
open going through development reviews

00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:16,719
and testing give dot or provides that

00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:22,059
complete open collaborative development

00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:24,639
lifecycle so as we come to the end of

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:27,729
the keynote I would like to conclude by

00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:31,919
saying that innovation is exploding in

00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:34,809
all aspects of our lives whether it's

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:38,279
artificial intelligence autonomous

00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:43,320
machines 5g networks cloud computing

00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:45,369
mobile devices or even IOT networks and

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,619
what I'm showing on the right hand side

00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:50,700
is some of the major challenges that has

00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:53,409
come out in the major cyber security

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,179
reports showing there are going to be a

00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,519
lot of challenges in the cyber security

00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,799
space in the coming decade but one of

00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,629
the very recurring themes in many of

00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,969
these reports is of course the

00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:05,979
complexity of security is ever in the

00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:09,489
increase we are going to see an

00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:11,440
increasing skills gap in trying to solve

00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:13,779
some of these challenging security

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,299
issues of course the vulnerability and

00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:19,119
attack surface is ever in the increase

00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:21,460
and if we combine this data with what

00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,889
Matthias is showing inish in the

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,419
beginning of the presentation around the

00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:30,219
NIST database number about the number of

00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:33,969
firmware Wallner released that has hit

00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:37,719
us during 2019 and it it hitting a

00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:40,059
record high during 2019 we think it's

00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:42,820
quite essential that the arm ecosystem

00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:44,230
that is going to create the next billion

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,480
devices

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,790
should definitely come together bring

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,660
all their expertise under the trusted

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,020
form a.org

00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,860
umbrella to make even more secure

00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,510
devices during the coming decade and

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,640
with that I would like to conclude the

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,429
presentation but just remind everyone to

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,220
stay safe and secure as we go through

00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:07,960
some of these challenging times please

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,210
do visit trusted form a.org

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,790
please do get yourself registered to all

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,590
the mailing list so that you can become

00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,980
part of the collaboration right from

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,460
design implementation and testing thank

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,460
