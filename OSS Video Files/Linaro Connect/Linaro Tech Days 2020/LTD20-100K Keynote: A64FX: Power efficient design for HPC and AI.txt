Title: LTD20-100K Keynote: A64FX: Power efficient design for HPC and AI
Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: Linaro Tech Days 2020
Description: 
	Description:
Fujitsu developed the A64FX processor that is optimized for HPC (High Performance Computing) and the AI(Artificial Intelligence).
A64FX is used in Fugaku supercomputer which is a massively parallel supercomputer and a successor to K-computer.
A64FX is based on Fujitsu microarchitecture, as used in our SPARC64 and mainframe processor development.
It provides the world's top-class flops/watt, computing performance and memory bandwidth. A64FX Prototype took 1st place in the Green500 November 2019.
To achieve high performance and low power consumption in a wide range of actual applications, we collaboratively work with RIKEN (co-design).
For ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), Fujitsu chose to adopt the Armv8-A with SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) to best position the Fugaku to utilize and contribute to a broader user base.
Fujitsu has collaborated with Arm as a lead partner and contributed to the development of SVE of the HPC and AI extension for the Armv8-A.
I would explain the processor features from the standpoint of microarchitecture and ISA.
