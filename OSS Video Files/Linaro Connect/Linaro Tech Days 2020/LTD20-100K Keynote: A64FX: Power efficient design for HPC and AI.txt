Title: LTD20-100K Keynote: A64FX: Power efficient design for HPC and AI
Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: Linaro Tech Days 2020
Description: 
	Description:
Fujitsu developed the A64FX processor that is optimized for HPC (High Performance Computing) and the AI(Artificial Intelligence).
A64FX is used in Fugaku supercomputer which is a massively parallel supercomputer and a successor to K-computer.
A64FX is based on Fujitsu microarchitecture, as used in our SPARC64 and mainframe processor development.
It provides the world's top-class flops/watt, computing performance and memory bandwidth. A64FX Prototype took 1st place in the Green500 November 2019.
To achieve high performance and low power consumption in a wide range of actual applications, we collaboratively work with RIKEN (co-design).
For ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), Fujitsu chose to adopt the Armv8-A with SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) to best position the Fugaku to utilize and contribute to a broader user base.
Fujitsu has collaborated with Arm as a lead partner and contributed to the development of SVE of the HPC and AI extension for the Armv8-A.
I would explain the processor features from the standpoint of microarchitecture and ISA.

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:45,200
on to that focus on the media processing

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:49,940
at the DSP processing and on another

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:55,010
general purpose yes a bit as super here

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:57,290
become servile standard brutal area its

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,140
newest reporter various data types be

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,000
under differ - medics for example to

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,890
accelerate the application

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,300
how could have president floating-point

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:10,810
is medically supported also 16 beat and

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,110
8-bit integer dot product instruction is

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,600
implemented

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:19,980
another interesting feature which we has

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,170
a big toe rings acoustic mechanism the

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,060
other implementer can't use the big toe

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,580
rings which is supported by the

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,450
implemented hardware

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:35,850
speakable 128-bit to 2048 a bit

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:38,459
implementation also really enable binary

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,170
child execute different machine that

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:45,529
will have a profound effect on rings

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:49,110
without lubricant fire the meaning is

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:51,779
true is we can provide the capability

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:56,209
for wider range of communication and it

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,209
contribute to builder software ecosystem

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,120
let me explain the microchips aside to

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,709
use our processing supercomputer food

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,300
are leaking and food started to design

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:15,329
we can have defined a nine priority

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,120
issue to have to solve to achieve

00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:20,130
performance blur to the application to

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,870
deter provided a bonus estimation of

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,550
total application

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,470
and who knows estimation to the Assessor

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:32,130
also freed provided such a statistical

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,110
of a behavior by using the data

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,510
information we can modify its source

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,380
code to arrive Hardware behavior an

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:42,540
estimated the promise of the application

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,640
based on the written evaluation who

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,779
destroy the feedback for my crabstickz

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:52,380
design and the chart study surgery over

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:55,770
the top priority application based on

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:59,490
that feedback please to refine our micro

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:02,100
structure design thatís because of this

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,320
who design effort have made for this

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,230
micro architecture stronger and have

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,610
improved a human's application for nine

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:14,579
priority issues we can announcer

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:19,620
predicative Akuma soul food our forces

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:22,949
are priority application Genesis and

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:26,820
nakum red cave are expected to be over

00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:29,339
100 times faster in computer

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,970
in addition that geometric of nine

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,639
priority and nineteen masses are

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:39,149
expected to be over 37 times greater I

00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:45,540
be observed it continues to our society

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:48,529
to solve our issue based on that data

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,779
feedback which is implemented our

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:54,839
microarchitecture excuse I have for FX

00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:57,990
and house is only he has a superficial

00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,949

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:05,449
provides the whole integer area to 5 1

00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:08,220
to B to D engine and predicate operation

00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:10,769
also after would have mechanism very bar

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,079
good performance advances to the

00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:16,170
instruction can execute on the I want to

00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:20,940
be 3d engine also road storage can

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:23,670
execute to I want to beat rod work 500

consumption product for a critical

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:34,350
situation we developed a new technology

00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:37,410
that we have friend up yet let me talk

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,839
about a many quadrature for medical

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,010
certain who is a stunt that Handelman

00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:09,930
computation operation such as a daemon

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:11,880
process and I know process or CMC keep

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,540

00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:59,110
ratio in echeverria by high efficiency

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,809
to October sorry I ever sent out over

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,869
the mechanism in quark cache and memory

00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:08,829

pig circuit or everyone just memory on

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:18,309
the river to just memory to watch it all

00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:20,379
ba 230 kilobytes classical over 115

00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:25,420

and memory of telling her it means her

00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,999
acquaintances achieve superior is

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:45,639
efficiency for a wide range of

00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:47,980
application as I explained we designed

00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,699
this 4x4 by the high performance and

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,709
high boundaries however generally

00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:55,360
hypotenuse and low-power is not too easy

00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:58,809
to achieve all at the same time

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,209
i fabulous cruises certain to require

00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,309
more transistor to implement each

00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:06,850
control many a given unit

00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:10,360
Rishikesh also it needs MCP five shippi

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:13,209
frequency butter to reserve power

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:16,959
consumption we have to go to protect it

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:20,949
from direction that means they are

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:24,069
conflicted image to get over it this

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,470
difficulty ex-wife x-ray arises GPU

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:32,470
trust polymers for what even though

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:34,990
general HPC CPU to handle this

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,700
difficulty we use the unification

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,299
corrosive and physical power design

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:43,120
methodology fronting the designer always

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:46,450
considering the design world including

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,970
the physical design and for design the

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,730
pasta into designer gives a feedback to

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,179
the front end designer based on the

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,429
physical design past me

00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,770
improved design flow realizes Prakriti

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:03,880
back between the front end and back end

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:07,780
designer as a result of this we could

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,330
implement many ideas to reduce the power

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:17,380
consumption keeping the polymers and

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:19,299
bodies so about figure is showing the

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,640
typical ice cubes Angus doozy

Rosie - designer hands off the Rosi con

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,350
physical design of pressure on the route

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,270
and the feedback to those supposed to

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,429
design waste of the same time and make

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,669
another study design must travel with

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,980
Akuma's power and the area by using a la

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:38,100
miss Dorothea would you designers and

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,630
physical designers were watching Twitter

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,059
overall - insider or GQ designer

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,159
implemented a special design considering

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,500
the power consumption on the backhand

00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,690
side physical designer gave the feedback

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,650
every day and optimize the awfulness

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,950
power area it makes minimizes the second

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,230
margin a bit of commerce power area

00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:01,240
daily improve daily improvement achieves

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,490
such kind of good power consumption

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,020
create a new idea to improve the design

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:10,450
who post by another as a result of those

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,700
mr. Z we achieved a high performance

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,400
high bandwidth and high performance per

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:19,929
watt actuary I garage so the package

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:22,900
mark we have evaluated the Pumas similar

00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,940
to POS this application this graph is

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,480
real to speed operation compared with a

similar ranks walk with a 50 B with this

00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:51,789
application I would like to show another

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:55,870
result we were sorting the high we can

00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:59,919
obtain that up to three point seven

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:02,880

00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:14,980
what design at the same time on the

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:19,570
graphics processor next I DirectX pray

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:21,899
action further the development factory

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:29,529
going I'm going to talk about of Sudak

00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:31,529
now recap about design optimized water
