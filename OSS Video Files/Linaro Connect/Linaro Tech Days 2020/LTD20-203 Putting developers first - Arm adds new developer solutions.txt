the ecosystem developer evangelist at

00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:12,860
arm for the infrastructure line of

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,499
business and this talk is about putting

00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,619
developers first and more specifically

00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:20,599
putting on developers first but before I

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,430
dive into this presentation

00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:25,010
I do have a couple personal notes I

00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:28,310
wanted to add in to this to this talk

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,830

I going to talk about I'm going to talk

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,350
about the developer Network so the arm

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,060
developer network as a whole this is

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,730
kind of to get you all up to speed on

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,810
some of the jargon I'm going to be using

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,160
throughout this presentation

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,160
people throw around the words like

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,450
developer Network developer website

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,640
developer communities this kind of stuff

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,140
developer ecosystem I want to kind of

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,330
get you up to speed on my jargon that

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,760
I'll be using so arm developer network

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,800
we'll talk a little bit about that

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,540
content and resources so what's new like

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,640
what's the purpose of this this whole

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,970
presentation and why am I here we're

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,860
gonna dive into a bit of strategy as in

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,110
why are we doing this

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,180
and that's that's gonna be a fun one and

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,410
then talking about developer

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,590
interactions and this is kind of

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,480
something a little different the

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,120
approach that we're taking and what

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,940
exactly is our content providing to

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,970
developers in terms of communication

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,340
bridges so what are we doing to make

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,920
sure that developers have the bridges

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,840
that they need to communicate across the

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,459
different communities across different

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,720
partners and companies these are the

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,920
different types of interactions that

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,360
we're going to be providing through this

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,489
new developer program that were that

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,630
we're going to be talking about I'm

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,670
gonna give a website preview because

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,680
most of what we're gonna be doing here

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,329
today is talking about the new stuff

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,640
that we're putting on the arm developer

00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:24,530
website so I'm gonna give a website

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,030
preview and then we're gonna talk about

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,859
what's next so you know after this

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:32,150
presentation is over what can you expect

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:36,100
to see coming out of this arm developer

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,959
Network program website etc etc alright

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,700
so summarizing arm developer Network

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
when I say our developer Network I mean

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,260
everything so I'm developer Network and

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,639
you know other people are gonna have

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,130
possibly different definitions of this

00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,900
but for me arm developer network is

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,819
everything from an arm point of view

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,350
we're talking about everything and I

00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,359
really like to summarize this or

00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,630
categorize this into five pillars of

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:02,000
community looking at this these are kind

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,280
of our pools of developers from left to

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,750
right you have arm lobs so these are the

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,579
lines of business the different

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,470
verticals within arm you can look at

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,260
this as the teams or the groups of

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,290
people within arm we're doing technology

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,220
specific stuff so these are developers

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,810
these are people who are developing

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,479
things and doing stuff within the

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,769
different communities arm company so

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,240
this arm is a whole and again this is an

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,370
arm perspective or arm point of view the

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,050
way I look at it I'm company as a whole

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,810
these takes this takes these different

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,130
logs these different

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,110
oops with in arm and then puts them

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,400
together unites all these different

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,590
technologies and efforts and make

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,460
something bigger and better and so this

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,350
is kind of putting everything together

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,639
these are also developers and these are

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,740
people who are doing stuff and sharing

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,590
and showcasing then we go into the

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,300
partners right so arm partners this is

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,250
probably I've never worked with such a

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,010
big partner ecosystem it's just it's

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,840
amazing and so you know with this comes

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,389
of course their developers and their

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,720
communities and so this adds to this

00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:01,169
pool adding another strong pillar to

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,610
this to this ecosystem and adding to

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,889
this pool of developers so working with

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,570
our partners it's just amazing and then

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,340
this stretches even further another

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,860
layer of abstraction our partners

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,360
partners so third-party partners this is

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,800
the kind of stuff that you just kind of

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,510
see pop up on the internet and you're

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,190
just like wow that's amazing someone

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,540
built that why am I not working with

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,370
them yet oh they're already working with

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,560
one of our partners that's awesome and

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,720
so you start to see this kind of synergy

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,669
across these these different pillars and

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,990
then of course you know you don't want

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,430
to forget mentioning the greater

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,620
community this makes up basically

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,600
everyone right and so you can kind of

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,430
look at these pillars and say I'm part

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,690
of one two three and four you know I'm

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,789
part of all these and

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,560
and and I'm pretty sure a lot of people

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,450
who are watching this consider

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,419
themselves developers and I'm sure you

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,130
sit in one or more of these pools

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,419
referring to the jargon the terminology

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,560
the muse arm developer network is

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:54,210
everything arm developer website is

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,820
where we host a lot of our stuff and

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,030
then the arm developer program is going

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,280
to sit within the arm developer website

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,500
allowing kind of us to tap into these

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,889
developers and allowing the developers

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,350
to also simultaneously tap into the arm

00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,229
ecosystem and our various communities as

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,180
well as our amazing partner ecosystem so

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,430
this program that we're talking about

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,110
kind of ties it all together and allows

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,600
this these different developer

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,720
interactions these communication bridges

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,520
to just function more efficiently all

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,479
right let's summarize what's going to be

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:37,620
new today so I have to give a shout out

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:40,200
our sorry our our arm content team and

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,490
technical communications team have just

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,330
basically pulled off a mere

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,860
and pushed out a substantial amount of

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,300
content and this is just yesterday

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,580
alright so we've been working on this

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,039
for several months and just yesterday

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,440
it's live now you can go to developer

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,330
darn com4 slash solutions or slash

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,180
infrastructure and you are going to find

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,550
new infrastructure solutions pages which

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,949
I'm going to talk more in detail on this

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,330
in just a bit I'll even showcase some of

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,930
them but we have thirty three new

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,580
solutions pages we have a brand new arm

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,380
ecosystem partners page on that will

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,130
continue to grow we have a new

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,750

but we will be pushing out a constant

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,840
influx of technical content and

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,610
enablement we'll be working with our

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,380
partners the greater community of course

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,340
arm internally and we'll be pushing out

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,470
all sorts of really cool stuff

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,870
onboarding new partners and working on

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,580
new collaborations we're not just going

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,560
to launch all this new stuff and then

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,419
say okay bye like we're launching this

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,970
new stuff as a foundation to build upon

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,669
this is our wireframe and we are going

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,430
to be building an amazing Castle of arm

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,020
technical content for our developers so

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,300
this is this is the first step towards

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,159
that all right

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,409
content and resources you've got kind of

00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,639
a high look at their high view of of

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:07,830
what we're going to be showing you in

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,620
just a minute why are we doing this

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,590
what's the strategy behind all of this

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,849
so in general you can say that we're

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,490
trying to create compelling reasons for

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,169
developers to embrace arm as a leading

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,090
architecture as the medium architecture

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,610
we're specifically focused on

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,020
infrastructure we want to we want to

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,250
create compelling reasons for people or

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,889
developers to embrace arms leading

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,449
Architecture from edge to cloud and to

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:32,839
enable frictionless development and

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,729
deployment of cloud native applications

00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,919
to do this again I'm going to kind of

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,469
reiterate or echo two things I've been

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,130
talking about but we have to find a way

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,959
to provide developers with a strong

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,329
interface and experience when they're

00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,610
consuming and interacting with our

00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:52,110
content so to do this we plan on

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,670
providing technical guidance and

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,930
resources for developers of all

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,700
experience levels

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,170
this is working again with all those

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,390
five pillars of community that I

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,080
mentioned earlier to get this content

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,670
built out and then showcase in a very

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,430
consumable way through the armed

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,140
developer website we want to unite

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,570
communities with common goals and

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,630
incentives this is huge because the art

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,760
ecosystem is huge and this ecosystem

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,770
consists of tons of different

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,810
communities and so if we can find ways

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,480
to unite these communities under common

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,190
goals then the stuff that comes out of

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,500
this becomes much bigger and better and

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,029
so this is one of our main one of our

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,709
big goals here we want to foster

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:33,510
community building of course community

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,700
building to then feed into this unity of

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,680
communities and one of my favorite ones

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,110
here is strengthening the relationships

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,480
between our partners our developers the

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,310
ecosystem as a whole and arm so taking

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,200
all these pillars right and putting a

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,880
little bridge across all of them so that

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,300
there's this communication layer they're

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,120
allowing you know strong interactions

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,610
and collaborations for for the better of

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,140
the arm developer last but not least of

00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,400
course enabling developers and this kind

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,230
of feeds into strengthening the

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,750
relationships but we want to enable the

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,089
developers arm developers to utilize

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,980
these resources the best as possible as

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,700
well as providing these interactive

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,750
communication layers okay so this is

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,850
where I get to break down these

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,180
developer interactions and the way I

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,550
look at the developer network and how

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,830
the developers get you interact in this

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,410
network so there's these four boxes

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,690
right so the first one is the developer

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,339
can go experience the developer network

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,230
or the developer program or the

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,510
developer website everything under the

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,279
umbrella there and as you're consuming

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,900
or as you're visiting this you can

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,459
simply just go there and consume stuff

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,320
okay there's gonna be lots of technical

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,320
content and guides and things that you

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,540
can explore and utilize this is just the

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,370
consuming and contribution aspect do you

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,570
find maybe some open source project

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,760
there's something fun that you know you

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,310
built well you know consume something

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,130
build upon it contribute it back there's

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,110
lots of cool stuff going on around there

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,360
that's the consumption the second one is

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,700
community to arm and I think that this

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,890
one is very important and might not have

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,630
existed so pretty so predominantly

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,240
before this new developer program

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,130
um what we're trying to do here is we're

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,080
trying to create this bridge for the

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,410
community of developers to communicate

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,110
with us we want to provide a way for

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:22,890
developers to voice their needs

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:26,040
voice voice their ambitions voice their

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,960
concerns and feedback around what we're

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,230
enabling and what needs to be enabled on

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,030
arm and so l F stands for looking for so

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,770
looking for enablement and collaboration

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:38,190
and we're trying to provide solid

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:41,670
channels for developers to reach arm and

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:46,080
the people at arm in order to in order

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:47,850
to seek out what they need third box arm

00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,880
to community of course we're going to

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,470
keep our blogs and our news and so this

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,370
is allowing you to stay current on

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,810
what's going on

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,490
what infrastructure activities are going

00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,110
on focused are here on on the

00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,760
infrastructure line business what's

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,530
going on with infrastructure well keep

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,600
pushing out blogs and news and all this

00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,080
cool stuff on this one on but to add to

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,170
this arms of community box here we also

00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,060
have a new developer twitter handle now

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,180
this developer twitter handle is very

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,920
new you go follow it i'll share that

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,420
share that the handle in just a bit but

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,070
this is another way for you to stay

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,080
up-to-date I mean we really hope to

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,140
start utilizing this Twitter handle more

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,210
frequently as soon as possible so it's

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,970
very new the last box here is

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:33,780
peer-to-peer so you know as mentioned

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,280
above new forums chats uniting by

00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,550
uniting all of these communities you'll

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,470
find that you know various partners have

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,630
IRC channels discord server slacks

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,400
channels there's all sorts of different

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,710
things going on in the different

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,660
communities and we want to make sure

00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,030
that you're aware of which ones are out

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,800
there and how you can how you can get

00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,740
the best out of these different

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,160
communities and forums and chats not to

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,760
mention not to forget to mention um a

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,590
new armed infrastructure solutions for

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,730
them and so I'm gonna give touch on all

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,830
this when we go through this website

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,560
preview but we do have a new

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,870
infrastructure solutions form which we

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
are going to also catalyze to build up a

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,400
very engaging community there as well

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,320
for those of you who are interested in

00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,170
exploring

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,200
Archer solutions ok I think I made it to

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,480
the website preview okay so website

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,060
preview I was gonna do a screen share

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,980
for this but I decided instead so that

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,540
we avoid technical issues I just kind of

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,560
put it on to slide deck so I hope the

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,600
animations work and everything goes well

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,580
ok new developer old developer is

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,520
someone who is just exploring arm

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:47,280
developer for the first time um you head

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,320
over to develop or arm comm now I want

00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,760
to show you exactly what I'm talking

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,260
about when it comes to the new stuff

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:57,510
that we've released literally today

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,590
these are the infrastructure solutions

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,860
that I'm talking about

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,030
so developer dawn arm come on the top of

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,100
that page you'll find our global

00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,900
navigation right there you'll see the

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,600
solutions tab so you go over to the

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,250
solutions tab you move your mouse down

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,260
just a little bit and then there you

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,550
have infrastructure so this is where

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,650
we're talking this is where the magic is

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,820
right now click infrastructure and

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,230
that's going to take you to our new

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,050
landing page so this landing page

consists of as I mentioned across this

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,690
entire slide show the various ways for

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,650
you to interact with our new developer

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:33,990
program developer resources the partner

Barnardo tech days right there front and

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,670
center developer resources again talking

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,250
about the bulk of the content ecosystem

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,140
partners is where you can kind of engage

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,210

saying and then on every single one of

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,040
these new pages at the very bottom

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,260
you're gonna find this big dynamic

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,810
rendering block which is the community

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,700
forums all right so let's dive into this

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,860
first we're going to click developer

00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,420
resources we want to go see what's going

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,250
on here and if you see at the bottom if

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,750
you I try to include the URL best as

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,940
possible where we're going so bottom

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,620
developer.com forward slash solutions

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,050
for slash instructor we want to click

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:36,820
the available resources block you

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:38,830
with this alright now this may not look

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,120
like a lot it may look like a lot but

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,010
what we're looking at here is just a

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,610
bunch of categories that basically

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:49,120
fulfill a big part of our software

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,070
ecosystem unarmed CI CD continuous

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,290
integration continuous deployment all

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,529
the way down to tools and developer

00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,750
platforms so we're trying to accent

00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:00,579
basically all different types of

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,079
foundational use cases through the

00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,240
through that through the way of

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,800
solutions pages so if you click on one

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,209
of these things which I'm going to show

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,620
you just a minute but if you click on

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,790
one of these boxes you're going to be

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,470
presented with a bunch of different

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,899
solutions pages each one of these

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,510
solutions pages of course highlights the

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:19,089
various things that you can do within

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:22,750
these these technologies or these

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:26,649
buckets or categories I want to just

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:29,440
show you exactly how many solutions

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,570
pages you are getting access to today so

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,180
we're starting this off with 33 new

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,829
solutions pages now I I also want to

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,649
point out that this is the beginning

00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:40,510
right so we are we have high high aims

00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,579
for this and we do plan on pushing out

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,480
plenty more we plan on updating this is

00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:48,250
a very living living program here so

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,399
starting with 33 solutions pages here's

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,829
a short list of what these 33 are and

00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,810
this will grow as soon as I'm hoping

00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:58,120
next week we're literally hitting this

00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,709
ground running momentum is there and

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,050
non-stop it's gonna just keep happening

00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:06,600
so here's a list of some of those from

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:09,130
drone i/o get get loud github actions

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,470
rancher dr. crane Oh

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,620
solid run package they're all they're

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:17,140
Alenia studio for HPC tools you're gonna

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,870
find all sorts of very very useful

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,000
content here alright let's break down

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,079
some of these pages to give you an idea

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,250
of what kind of stuff you're gonna find

00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:30,160
on them here I'm focusing on the Alenia

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:33,910
studio page so this is under the tools

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,030
section for bucket and to keep things

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,890
you know cohesive for developers we want

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,230
to we're really trying to focus on this

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,650
standardized look or a standardized

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,830
approach for these pages I'm hoping that

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,799
you know over time

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:53,600
we'll see other you know groups within

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:56,720
armed IOT automotive a I start joining

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,270
this this this movement and you'll start

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,549
finding solutions pages that tap into

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,220
this vast knowledge base and then pull

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:06,470
what's needed up in order to showcase

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,909
what's necessary for that technology if

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,770
that makes sense I really hope it did

00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:11,299
but basically we have this knowledge

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,010
base all this cool stuff all these

00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,510
things that are going on and we have all

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,399
these different verticals we want to

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,720
make sure that we're showcasing the use

00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:22,370
for a use cases for these specific

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,679
verticals and a very cohesive and

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,320
organized way so here you see at the top

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,210
page description there you're gonna find

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,279
how does this how does this technology

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,110
relate to arm right I mean in a very

00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,980
brief outline how does this technology

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,809
relates arm

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,250
how can you kind of use it right and

00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,429
then to learn more button which of

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,870
course will take you out to learn more

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,690
about that particular company and how it

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,760
relates arm then we have these solution

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,950
highlights with a featured resource so

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,980
we kind of pick several highlights

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,440
things that these technologies kind of

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,970
flourish on or do the best and we

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,919
showcase these and then we provide you

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,830
more resources there if you want to go

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,779
explore and/or consume some sort of

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,340
technical documentation and then at the

00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:06,350
very bottom we have resources and this

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,850
is kind of an aggregate of stuff right

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,120
and I want to emphasize on one thing I

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:14,320
put in in parentheses no hostages it's

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,370
something new but we're really trying to

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,390
make sure that we're showing you the

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:23,029
best content not just our content in in

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:26,929
the world of the internet there are

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:29,419
things out there that exist and that are

00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:30,770
really good and so we want to make sure

00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,230
that we're not just holding you hostage

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,850
here we want to make sure that we're

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,220
providing you with the right content the

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,309
best content that is there without

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,899
inventing reinventing the wheel I mean

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,700
this goes into those five pillars of

00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:46,070
community again which I always really

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,330
like to refer to but you know there are

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,220
people out there who are developing

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,539
amazing things and it's all on arm and

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,740
we want to make sure that we're

00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:56,630
showcasing these amazing things

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:59,000
especially relevant things and so these

00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,580
resources at the bottom are just like

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,700
the recipe

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,200
is very living very dynamic and so you

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,020
know one day you could visit this and

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,150
see you know 5linx the next day you can

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,700
visit you can see ten links and these

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,930
links might be keeping you on the arm

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,120
developer website and they might be

00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:18,540
foraging you out to some amazing

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,780
community members work on github and so

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,700
this is this is something that I really

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,170
like to emphasize on because there's

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,880
just so much cool stuff going out there

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,750
going on out there that we want to

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,800
showcase next page here I'm not going to

00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,480
have those little brackets there anymore

00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,010
but it's for Travis CI so you can see

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,410
the standardization across the pages

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,150
hopefully as you start to explore these

00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,770
you'll kind of get this unified feeling

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,120
where you're you know you're not having

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,730
to kind of relearn where to look for

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,110
things this is this is kind of the

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,270
approach we're taking here so you'll see

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,310
again at the top the frontmatter you

00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:53,820
have three highlights with the with the

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:55,290
feature buttons and then resources at

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,440
the bottom additional resources to go

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,920
explore documentation possibly projects

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,320
and/or technical docs for for building

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,950
things for Travis yeah and last but not

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,160
least of this particular zoom here zoom

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:14,190
in on these solutions pages is packet

00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,990
packet featuring works on arm so again

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,200
this is a great collaboration between

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:22,410
packet and arm you have the ability to

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,810
explore and experience most of what

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:28,860
packet has plus a little extra on this

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,820
all-inclusive page plus you'll get to

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,160
learn a little bit about what they're

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,330
doing and possibly even you know at the

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,040
bottom of this page I didn't include

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,280
here is the forum so maybe you might

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,160
even find some packet forum posts at the

00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,680
bottom there for people who are who are

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,890
who are working on packet stuff all

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,480
right

00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,640
excuse me Robert I wanted to give you

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,030
the three-minute warning okay great yeah

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,130
awesome thank you last but not least X I

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,140
think this is my last slide here if

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,970
we're going to go back or not have just

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,110
a few more so we're going to go back to

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,300
this front page we're at developer

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,910
resources scrolling over to the develop

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,620
or the ecosystem partners um click that

00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,660
you'll see that we have this you know

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,220
full list of ecosystem partners you can

00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,930
click on this this will take you over to

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,850
our solution pages it's just another way

00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,330
to close the loop providing you what you

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,660
need to know and learn

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:19,960
out our partners in a very developer

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,400
friendly way now this is last but not

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,960
least of course at the bottom of every

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,640
one of these pages you're gonna find a

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,200
community forums block this is dynamic

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,180
Ranger directly from our community

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,310
website this will take you over to that

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,870
particular post as you can see people

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,210
are already posting in our in our

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,940
infrastructure solution section thanks D

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,310
McDavid T for the for the question we

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,170
answered it got back to them if you want

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,730
to go back up to the higher level of the

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,710
forums you can just go click the

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,510
infrastructure solutions link there

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,560
that'll take you to the high level you

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,610
can see where all the rest of the

00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,470
questions are make an account log in and

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,050
or just explore what's going on there

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,820
and consume what's next steady flow of

00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,590
new content in the form of technical

00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,510
documentation regular social media

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,460
updates on developer spotlight this is

00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,050
working with the army innovator program

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,850
it's a million topic lots of really cool

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,230
stuff going around developers to

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,240
showcase them they stand at community

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,100
communication channels expand on the new

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,900
forum categories and catalyze new forum

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,910
engagement developer activation and

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,980
incentives events sponsorships

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,210
hackathons and so much more if you're

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,860
interested in knowing about any of these

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,330
kind of things I suggest go follow me my

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,420
twitter or the arm software developer

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:27,490
Twitter and reaching out to me Robert

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:32,530
arm comm didn't see it but I dropped my

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:34,240
little pointer thank you thank you but

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,130
though we have a minute or so for some

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,230
questions we do have a question from

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:43,450
Marcin Orson what about is your

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,420
pipelines it's a very popular CI

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:49,120
solution in Foss projects lack of a arch

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,920
64 there block several Python packages

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,980
and other stuff to be built for our

00:23:50,920 --> 00:24:00,850
architectures there are pipelines oh

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:04,690
okay yeah so as I mentioned we do plan

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:06,280
on adding in a bunch more stuff so so we

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,350
haven't really touched on as you are yet

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,660
in any of our solutions pages but you

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,790
can't expect hopefully I would I would

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,770
say you can't expect us to start doing

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,680
some stuff there I do know that on one

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,680
of our CI CD pages I don't know exactly

00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,540
which one right now but there is a

00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,730
documentation set there that shows you

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,260
how to build up exactly what you were

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,480
just talking about

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,160
there is some documentation there that

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,720
we pulled that we thought was very

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,120
useful for developers

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,160
I could marcin if you want to email me

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,690
