Title: LTD20-302 TinyML as-a-Service

	Description:

Machine Learning (ML) has been happening only in Cloud and ML inference is happening only on Edge. But there's quite few ML happening in IoT where Linux cannot fit. This area is called TinyML. In order to democratize ML in IoT, I propose TinyML as-a-Service, which would bring ML onto microcontrollers with 3 enablers, (1) Unikernel, (2) ML compiler and (3) CoAP. In this session, I'll explain our end-to-end experiment of how we tackled to bring ML onto Edge & microcontrollers, show demo and also discuss future possibilities. The audience are not expected much. The following links may be helpful if you discuss this session deeper. Enjoy!! #tinymlaas

* Unikernel
* MirageOS
* Ocaml
* Owl
* LwAE
* TinyML
* Tensorflow Lite for micro
* LwM2M
* CoAP
