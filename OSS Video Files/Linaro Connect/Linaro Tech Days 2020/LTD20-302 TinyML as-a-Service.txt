Title: LTD20-302 TinyML as-a-Service
Publication date: 2020-04-01
Playlist: Linaro Tech Days 2020
Description: 
	Description:

Machine Learning (ML) has been happening only in Cloud and ML inference is happening only on Edge. But there's quite few ML happening in IoT where Linux cannot fit. This area is called TinyML. In order to democratize ML in IoT, I propose TinyML as-a-Service, which would bring ML onto microcontrollers with 3 enablers, (1) Unikernel, (2) ML compiler and (3) CoAP. In this session, I'll explain our end-to-end experiment of how we tackled to bring ML onto Edge & microcontrollers, show demo and also discuss future possibilities. The audience are not expected much. The following links may be helpful if you discuss this session deeper. Enjoy!! #tinymlaas

* Unikernel
* MirageOS
* Ocaml
* Owl
* LwAE
* TinyML
* Tensorflow Lite for micro
* LwM2M
* CoAP

	00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,960
hello everybody today I am going to talk

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:15,199
about timing ml of the problem and

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:19,020
here's our today's agenda from Who am I

00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,619
I'm a researcher in headaches from a

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,619
singer

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:31,710
I used to be a culinary console user

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:35,610
accessory working for CI format and the

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:39,350
nvidia tegra but recently i have been

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,350
doing is completely different

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:45,500
so what's is tiny'mon

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:53,290
so the traditional Italian is running

00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:57,370
machine learning infinite on sutala

00:00:53,290 --> 00:01:00,150
low-power microcontroller Massa are this

00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,150
big day

00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:08,100
this is only how their custody so our

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,960
interpretation of side energies like

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,270
this

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,060
so you fish here

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:21,670
there are actually technological area

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:24,880
Linux machine learning and IOT core

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:28,090
solidarity and the historical is the

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,960
overlapping area with dealer and IOC is

00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,240
a beginner under literally most of the

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,560
machine learning is happening contrast

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,170
is a training phase machine learning

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:48,420
insolence is happening in the area

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:52,899
it's completed but the another area RUP

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:56,500
machine learning but our device is did

00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:59,170
not cannot run so this is educanon and

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,440
this is the hardest part because all the

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,610
pain thought when the neck tell of the

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:09,310
line

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,310
so this is our definition not attainable

00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,460
so why is computing is not enough

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,730
so this is a spectrum of the computing

00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:29,110
and I started from cloud to compute the

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:32,540
eggs and device age and center so

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,459
proceeding with the sensor we thought it

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,459
are getting with more conference

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,569
ah

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:47,730
the officia nasty positive experience

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,579
coming from the center but our knowledge

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,299
are those data are not processed

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:57,440
efficiently because it's actually

00:02:53,299 --> 00:03:03,480
collected to the above Alania

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,830
and also since our device it can be

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,370
about the problem

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:14,910
so battery consumption is a problem as

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:18,540
you see here transmitting data consume

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:22,080
more energy by computing rate so it's

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,910
better not to changing a road a turn but

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,910
a process in place local

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,970
another one did Oh

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,300
that's it if you look at look at this

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:41,060
this is traditional IOT for camera is

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,420
working on the camera that tender are

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,879
the exact same raw image to the clamp

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,510
under it's plotted in the class this

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,349
required prolong connectivity hi

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,629
wondering but this case if you could see

00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:00,560
in machine learning learning the phone

00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:03,590
camera sensor then the metadata akka

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,140
process maple David quite smooth and it

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,280
can take the boundaries and also it

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,970
means a big button and the metadata so

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,010
it doesn't require some include any

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:20,440
private thing that the privacy is

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,440
freedom there are quite extreme

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,020
and also the current booth of machine

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,770
learning comes from deep neural networks

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,870
but the problem is the in model two

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,490
weeks to learn long of variety of

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,490
consonant IOT devices

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,570
so look at this he CVM one of the

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:49,790
implementation messenger and compiler

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:53,610
other for the attack so there are

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,770
multiple machine learning in the

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,370
framework they didn't have the

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:03,120
compatibility in the past but now we see

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,590
in production of open EDX open neural

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,210
network exchange format training and

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,430
Internet can be equipped different

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:16,590
flamen the training can be done with a

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:20,460
one flame up but the label on a souffle

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:24,030
mark but facilitated he has the one

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,750
problem the another is diversity over

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,990
the nice coverage we have according many

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,080
hardware and comments of airships

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:38,160
economy and any single flavor can

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,500
support everything and also typical

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,350
Python basics came up with the Fugees

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,780
still unknown such confident devices so

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,780
where we much internal compiler

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:58,620
so the technical machine and compiler is

00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,620
it will cheat in a drop of final m/l

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:10,840
well what is tiny another term

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:13,810
so this is our answer was the magic

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,190
Italian air technology but the

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,190
connectivity could apply yeah

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,240
there are huge gaps between the

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,870
development experience between the web

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,520
and and they're very hard

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,800
sixty-four we can sit here and get with

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,740
the gigabyte of memory and televise of

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:43,070
the storage and oh it is linear we

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:48,410
contain about that idea

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:51,880
an amazing one it has a variety in micro

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:56,630
controllers are used with at mode a

00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:01,130
megabyte of Nephilim appeal megabyte of

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:03,530
platinum and my life on the air fan

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,920
ology and there is no matter they are

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,920
for

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,790
the situation gets worse when our

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,990
machine learning environment

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:19,320
if one man started with the training in

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,220
the ground with BGP and after a

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,110
mysterious chemistry there are any

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,100
 unemployment terrible among us

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,100
in the area

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:37,380
to solve the situation what is needed is

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:39,830
cataloguing so we need to customize the

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,170
[Music]

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:46,190
but in learning your models to seeping

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:48,620
into the devices you use so it means the

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:52,520
first like our pizza online you need to

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,860
specify or what kind of coping with

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,260
living and what kind of basic needs so

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,260
this kind of customers and said

00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,260
customization

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,510
so this is like sex to you you are

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:08,840
indeed family another home

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:13,450
so octopod you need to know device

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:16,600
information then to find the appropriate

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:21,080
person a memorial for that service and

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:24,290
that model to be a skort is fittingly

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,240
included with the bike Iran and but this

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:30,530
is not only about the model but we need

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,160
to change the Granton ugly because the

00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:40,340
nature proper vampire included to run on

00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:43,460
the device and we made four or disappear

00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,890
efficiently still unknown and I talked

00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,800
to be focused again on the device so

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,460
those six steps are needed to find

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,460
another house

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:58,990
you

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,490
then what did they look like look at

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,420
this

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:07,779
clean reassuringly stand on a cloud and

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,970
train the model employed in a Model T in

00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:15,190
the cloud and this model cannot to be

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,440
run on this device directions because

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:21,490
it's terrific and also this is diversity

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,010
how did I am I so the customization

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,790
product with the proposed tiny error

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:30,060
under charge and it's backed by the

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:34,330
multinational component because

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,220
diversity of a axis because it's a big

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,860
of course the information from the

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:43,029
device and download the model and

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,279
compiling an appropriate image and its

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,310
quality which means focused related on

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,880
the info such a how finally made on the

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,880
front work

00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:01,230
and so far we need to support multiple

00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:03,720
backends like multiple compile and so we

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,470
expect the background improviser as a

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,110
ghost image it's like a function of the

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:14,160
third so the front end just for the joke

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:19,829
is the actual unknown like compiler is

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,569
story advice and for orchestrating

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,480
Palookaville

00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:26,189
we are connected using language and same

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,019
it doesn't have to be like to attend

00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:33,449
same but this is for student right now

00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,230
and this is one of the popular is

00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:37,050
assumable

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,040
it can export the future of the devices

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,040
in a standard manner

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:47,440
contradict protocol support Tata and the

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:49,930
proton and the Tata is somewhere over

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,080
the airplane so done with superior

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:56,640
over-the-air update so what it is the

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,959
difference is kata is to update and

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,360
profile is the pattern appearance of

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,390
course partial update is preferable for

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,580
us because it can take a little net1 and

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:17,649
eventually saving battery and each other

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:22,209
a positive this is ensign General Thomas

00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:26,680
is from pain if API server which

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:28,750
provides ingest API to again the objects

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,360
like devices and the budget is

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:36,480
associated with compiler in training and

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:42,390
in store and if you post and are in the

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,390
balcony six critical flaw

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:52,810
literally IOT platform has orchestrating

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,690
public located is a mechanism we do that

00:11:52,810 --> 00:12:01,190
animated public can make use of dobkin

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:04,640
existing infrastructure so tiny America

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:10,130
farm can be officially integrated into

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:12,050
the existing back home and can

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,800
accommodate luggage police facility

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,800
compiler

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:24,590
so this is a tiny Emma at the front

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:28,580
which we are working on so then next big

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:45,860
ecosystem so what is way ecosystem is

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:50,690
leads for us look at this one company as

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:54,080
you think here we have the multiple back

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:57,320
end here so any single company cannot

00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,780
support everything by Orton and we need

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,800
to collaborate to collaborate

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:06,080
efficiently we need to define some other

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,300
interface for the ecosystem and

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,040
currently I am concerning with those

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,630
tweets interfaces compiler plugins

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,390
orchestration and the internet border

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,600
condom I am looking at the our one by

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,600
one

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,630
- from Kampala problem

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,670
so model is downloaded and we competed

00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:36,100
in the panel and another time but

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:38,379
instead multiple compiler will be

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,480
supported so which means at the us later

00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:41,800
to switch fight keep plugging in the

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,649
face

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:50,350
but uh what what the interface in here

00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:53,499
so it can be categorized into two inputs

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,809
an altitude but input device insulin

00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,149
hi Matt alarm how much is only available

00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:01,480
and also what kind of cuddly on

00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:04,209
carelessness with the bite huh and also

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,449
of course a genetic model has to be

00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:09,689
passed to the compiler and how much code

00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:14,439
by region because controller

00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:20,230
quantization is our satisfaction and in

00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:22,619
in Vita Pasolini compiler will return

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,389
with the compiler module which are

00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:29,049
Tamura bug on the model with specialized

00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:32,880
lambda because little pasta done and

00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:36,959
still be gotta be in combined

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:41,899
so this is AC compiler plumbing the next

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,899
one is orchestration protocol

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,810
so of course I need to take device any

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,320
performance device and the based on data

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,690
information are with this module is

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,680
diminished and this motor has to be we

00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,680
pass to the device

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,250
so far sundered lightweight m'kay photon

00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:11,519
the photon and it's object is enough why

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,399
we don't do anything more than that and

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,480
alleged our papa is more fun people

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:22,139
drive up with such a gigantic amount of

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,689
size difference one can be space also

00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:30,329
even with the device does not support

00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:34,350
for large within them we have some work

00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:38,220
on you can insert Sammy librarian at the

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:41,910
end and facilitated issue as each device

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,430
in the librarian on our balconies candle

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:48,589
to the deconstruction for this can be

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,589
with other condition

00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,660
the last one not to eat okay

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:10,759
modular form copper nitrate mm strata

00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:13,680
fixed by ze only protocol on how the

00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:19,040
binary is installed after the abilities

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,040
together on implementation but

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:27,070
oh geez there are many they are

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:31,060
technology but this this modular format

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:34,060
is always allotted then we can say the

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:37,810
compliation and the same module can be

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:41,370
used to fall over but yet the more that

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,370
is very convenient is fading

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:52,509
and I see there are three profiles and

00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:54,369
the first one is general purpose quite a

00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:58,360
rich environment and secondly very much

00:16:54,369 --> 00:17:00,999
in this one needs a beer maker for the

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,819
general environment like raspberry pie

00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:06,790
even Linux and then our own extract on

00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:09,640
excellent NBC -

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:12,640
and hope their metal case you don't have

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,670
any other choice down finish classes but

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:22,470
for the end of the case you can i with

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:26,740
tata and tail club transfer with this

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:29,100
module format and this happen this kind

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,100
of thing

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:39,430
so those are the interface I'm looking

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:41,440
at and for fear if you use graduate and

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,210
then you don't do it much but our

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,710
balance of the interest has to be

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:50,110
summarized on the system fine and we

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,500
cannot be all by ourselves

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:55,330
that's why are we are looking for

00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:01,570
ecosystem partners to fit fine

00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:04,570
so the green dimension like hey I just

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:09,130
bender but in learning compiler vendors

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:12,220
and IOT device manufacturer also private

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:15,730
providers RL pilot images to include

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:18,750
fine an air of the problem the useful on

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,750
their businesses

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,810
you

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,930
you

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,090
you

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,990
okay I forget to mention about to be

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,650
some possibilities okay

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:50,730
for the Cardinal are we did last year to

00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:56,480
record that we did a mini cannon cannon

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:58,560
and that this was a presented in a

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,970
battle in Aqaba

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:09,320
last year and you can get all the

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:09,320
information from this side and there are

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:20,070
flood its 75th right mix describes it

00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:22,680
quite well about what I did for our

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:27,000
doctrine which we are meeting at least

00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:29,810
electrofishing and then this year I'm

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,810
working on

00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:38,600
this nullable IOT of cases with this

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:42,250
kind of devices and we get some with us

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,250
I also want to publish it

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,350
note that we have poverty

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,180
3 Rd so what is tanah Merah the hobbits

00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,680
and white tiny mirrors of authority

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:06,020
gives us how it can be implemented so if

00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:13,250
you are interest the condition and

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:17,160
consult we publish the article about de

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:22,700
cámara de Palestine I completely

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,700
disregarded Delta being so different

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:38,490
come on we are looking for partners

00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:42,960
along the ecosystem partner with it

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:45,780
fight to create interfaces compiler

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:50,340
problem unhook activation protocol and

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,000
incorrect module format we are quite

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,250
welcome

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,450
we will be very happy if you jump color

00:20:53,250 --> 00:21:00,059
work on Dante for control of piloting

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:02,900
partner the party a time in the rhetoric

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,900
in their fees

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,510
cause it's forever

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:17,460
HBase cloud-based Yogi's and are like

00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:21,160
one in the family which one you have

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,679
green Seto can go the Turkish gateway

00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,710
and Gatorade just an enrolled agent with

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,020
a class and all the images are landing

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,820
on Clark

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,380
this requires for all connectivity and

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:39,660
this is not flexible and the difficult

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:44,260
on a lot of investment the container is

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:48,190
tiny Marybeth days of solution has a 10

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:51,190
a loaded up and competitive process on

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:54,970
this microcontroller in place locally

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:57,970
and this does not require our own

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,550
community but another one is a little

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,700
conflicted and

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,700
[Music]

00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:21,259
so for example if you are looking for

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:23,799
clinic dimension like if you want to

00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:28,570
know when the time came is rate a

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:32,320
component before it gets booked then

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,320
finally the one which is

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:43,130
police impound families for expanding

00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:46,059
portable if you are ship the products

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:49,429
are deployed on the wider field which

00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:52,790
normally thought life like the Wi-Fi

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:55,400
cannot be claimed then Salomon is a

00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:58,990
Shanghai address and in that case is

00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,990
partially power is of pressure

00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,360
you

00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:18,490
so if you are interested in such

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:22,080
collaboration please contact me and we

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:28,919
are happy to collaborate with

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:32,049
calcaño Bellini thanks for listening

00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,850
Thank You Moshe um there's a couple of

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:36,159
questions in church if you could answer

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:40,509
in place for that question

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:44,529
he liked the information in the model

00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:48,639
Foreman we haven't thought about that

00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:52,840
that that utterly but it can be acted on

00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:56,739
globally the attitude of the modern era

00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:00,100
were taken about the binary modular

00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:04,840
format in the Lola Lola Linea the

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:08,440
operating point yes so the equation next

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:14,889
question is a definition of or confident

00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:16,730
IOT there are color specification in the

00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:18,240
IETF but

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:22,710
[Music]

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:27,710
in Britain says he I mean no Linux

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:32,360
environment like arm cortex-m city

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:35,880
arrested a little rabbit Enix lon

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:39,990
Sameera storage in the cloud can be

00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:42,980
applied but all the pain of when the
