Title: LTD20-303 Recent developments in I O control and testing
Publication date: 2020-04-01
Playlist: Linaro Tech Days 2020
Description: 
	Description:

This session is about the last main developments on I/O control and I/O testing, in the upstream Linux kernel. In more detail, we will cover: the adoption of the BFQ I/O scheduler in new systems, the new developments in the comparison among BFQ and the new Linux I/O controllers, and the last developments in I/O testing within the LKFT project.

Session Speakers
Anders Roxell
Software engineer (Linaro)

Versatile R&amp;D professional with 6 years experience in software development for embedded systems and their special requirements, with a large knowledge base of how to troubleshoot complex real time systems. The technical competence is built mostly upon R&amp;D within embedded systems in both telecommunication (e.g. base stations, media gateways) and automotive systems (e.g. engine-, gearbox-platforms).
Paolo Valente
Assistant professor (Linaro)


Paolo Valente is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and a collaborator of the Linaro engineering organization. Paolo's main activities focus on scheduling algorithms for storage devices, transmission links and CPUs. In this respect, Paolo is the author of the last version of the BFQ I/O scheduler. BFQ entered the Linux kernel from 4.12, providing unprecedented low-latency and fairness guarantees. As for transmission links, Paolo is one of the authors of the QFQ packet scheduler, which has been in the Linux kernel until 3.7, after that it has been replaced by QFQ+, a faster variant defined and implemented by Paolo himself. Finally, Paolo has also defined and implemented other algorithms, part of which are now in FreeBSD, and has provided new theoretic results on multiprocessor scheduling.
