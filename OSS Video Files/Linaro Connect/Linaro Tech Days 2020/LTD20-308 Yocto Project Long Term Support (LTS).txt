Description: 
	Description: 
The Yocto Project has been working over the last few months on a proposal to introduce Long Term Support releases (LTS).

The upcoming YP 3.1 release, planned for April 2020, is expected to become the first Yocto Project LTS release.

This presentation will focus on the following items:
* Why the Yocto Project needed a LTS.
* How the Yocto Project LTS release will be implemented.

	00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:09,370
um so hey everyone thanks for joining us

00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:11,559
today in this this is my first virtual

00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:15,610
event so let's see how things are going

00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:18,310
to go so I'm here today to talk about

00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,880
something which is happening for the

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:24,670
Yocto project which is a very important

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,170
event for the project which is about the

00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,640
along the announcement we've made it

00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,179
essentially about the long term support

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,100
so I'm I'm working for Lee now and I'm

00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:34,900
also the community manager for the Yocto

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,720
project so that's that's one of the

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,970
reason why I'm doing this talk today so

00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,190
what we are going to discuss so it's

00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,650
it's a fairly short amount of time so I

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,730
I mean we had to reduce and just go

00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,890
straight to the point

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,600
this is what we are going to discuss

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,350
today so I want to give a very very

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,540
quick explanation about how the Yocto

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,480
project is organized and the membership

00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:01,420
we won't go into any technical details

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,130
or into too many details about the Yocto

00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,260
project itself but it's just like a

00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,570
quick quick introduction in quick

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,430
overview then we will talk about the

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,010
current release process that we've been

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,200
following for I mean many years now

00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,930
which pretty much hasn't changed since

00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,240
the beginning we talked about the some

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,560
recent improvement that the project has

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,790
has done in terms of automated testing

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,180
which is actually one of the reasons why

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,580
we could discuss about 80s and then

00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,620
finally we talked about the LTS how it

00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,790
happened we'll share them in some

00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,740
details about that what it's going to be

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,870
and what's going to happen in next I

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,330
mean I mean very shortly and finally I

00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,540
mean I'm sure you want to help so how he

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,950
will be able to help us with this very

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,930
important change for the project so

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,460
let's start every every Yocto

00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,710
presentation start with this very thing

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,860
so basically what what is the Yocto

00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,110
project so it's not we have a lot of

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,000
issues with the terminology most people

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,610
are very confused by having what the

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,610
octo project is about so we try to

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,410
explain that as much as we can the art

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,990
project it's it's not a Linux

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,760
distribution it's not

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,320
it's it's a basically a set of

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,390
template's all the tools and all the

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,520
Middle's that you need so that you can

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,110
actually build your own Linux system so

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,940
it started came from the emitted space

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,520
and nowadays with its use more and more

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,700
now as well as oil but basically if you

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,560
have to remember something it's it's

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,900
basically everything all the tools you

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,550
need all the scripts that you need to

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,500
make your own Linux system so you don't

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,360
it's not one specific destroy it can

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,020
make as many disco as you want or as

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,940
many Linux system as you want

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,280
the organization itself so there is

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,950
there is a whole organization behind the

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,840
you of the project so it's it's hosted

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,530
it's a project which is hosted by the

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,570
Linux Foundation which started in 2010

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,160
it so it was the first collective

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,530
collaborative project started by the

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,020
Linux Foundation back then the project

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,330
architect was and still he is today

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,700
which are purely most most people

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,970
involved with the project should know by

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,990
now the project uses openembedded which

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,820
is another open-source project that was

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,170
specialized in building a Linux

00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,750
distribution which started way before

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,210
that but there is definitely a very

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,920
close relationship between the open Amit

00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:31,840
project and the Yocto project the

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,510
Governing Board so basically the

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,720
organization is made of members the

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,640
members are companies they are typically

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,880
Linux Phoenician corporate members and

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,060
we have different levels of membership

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,280
base and I mean how much the company

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,620
wants to be involved with the project

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,870
and how much they can but basically we

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,680
have silver gold and platinum level

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,210
memberships a membership and the company

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,060
that joined the project or the company

00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,640
that want to influence the project

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,620
direction every major decision in the

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,930
project or technique and change that we

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,080
make to the project organization or is

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,300
actually voted by the governing members

00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,910
but this company also contribute I mean

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,380
financially I mean although there is a

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,660
certain amount of money that we need to

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,120
agree on the project I mean everybody

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:26,290
must know by now but we run many

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,720
services build servers and we we also

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,069
have some

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,720
websites and we have many I mean we have

00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,159
I mean some course that stated who is

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,110
running the project so that's basically

00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:37,629
all the the the member organization that

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,389
actually thanks to this company that we

00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:44,469
we can do that today the governing board

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:46,060
also is nominating and voting for the

00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:48,340
Yocto project technical steering

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,110
committee which is something fairly new

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,599
in the life of the projects that is the

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,490
last year but that's been instead is

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,430
last year but that's also a big an

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,889
important step for the governing member

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,870
you have a couple of links here that if

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:03,909
you're interested in learning more about

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,310
the membership structure on how to join

00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:08,740
the project and of course I mean we can

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,030
always come back to me later I fear any

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,310
any specific questions the way the

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,169
day-to-day project is organized is

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,360
around the governing board also called

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,940
the advisory board and we have different

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,039
teams and I mean they are like

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,500
individuals running I mean each of these

00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,090
teams we have on one side the technical

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,789
side the TSC

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,009
and which is in charge of all the

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,139
technical decision for the project the

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,479
governing board is in charge of

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,159
basically all the business decisions the

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,919
budgets and the general administration

00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:44,979
for the project so we meet as as much as

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,960
needed from time to time and that's how

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,789
I'm in the project I mean our heroes and

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
is making decisions and then on top of

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,139
that we have the advocacy team and the

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,719
community team where we actually look at

00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,219
things like marketing or organizing

00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,740
events I mean if you know about the

00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:01,389
project I've heard or have even attended

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,520
one of the death day for example New

00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,199
York to project summit so that's the

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,659
kind of things that we organize it's

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,250
people that are involved and closely

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,680
involved with the project and I mean

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:16,539
discussing these things and making

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,669
decisions in that regard so again that

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:20,860
was a very quick and whole I didn't want

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,539
to have this talk without giving some

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,990
background about how the project is

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:27,610
organized because that also explains how

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,490
we ended up with making the decision

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,580
about the 80s for example the current

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,699
get is process so it's it's a known fact

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,459
but we basically have been doing - well

00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,350
easy to release is a year since the very

00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:43,840
first one dot orchid is

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,610
they're as it has never never failed we

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,800
have sometimes slightly postponed by the

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,110
amount the ladies but that's that's as

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,140
much as we've done there is a release in

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,000
the spring in April and in October the

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,970
folder kitties and it's been like that

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,130
since the beginning so all the the

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,800
project has a very predictable hideous

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,530
cadence we have this six month cadence

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,300
where we do a bunch of the changes and

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,460
most of the tastic changes as early as

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,230
possible in the release cycle and then

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,360
we tend to have milestones where we

00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,910
actually feature complete and then we

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,040
start heavy testing of the project so

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,500
that's what we are doing also just to

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,970
avoid some misunderstanding so what we

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,580
call a release of the octo project is

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,070
basically in what some people we call

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,620
the pakka tree that's basically the

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,470
aggregation of Oh a co-op an ability Co

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,700
bit baked metal Yocto and the whole set

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,160
of documentation as well so that's

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:42,310
basically what we end up releasing every

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:44,140
six month what our Lee's usually include

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,630
and again I mean that's usually I mean

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,670
it can change but we in the major

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,550
release so every six month we can make

00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,650
any change we can include a BIA API

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,630
changes in all the components so I mean

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,130
the project is about the maintenance of

00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,750
all the metadata for the open source

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,780
project so we include all the latest

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:05,740
version of every project that we support

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:08,020
and maintain we include new features so

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,420
we can even break things like in bitbake

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,140
we can actually make drastic changes

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,760
everywhere we tend to use the LTS a

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,530
kernel version as much as we can because

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,760
that's I mean that's that's something

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,920
which is much easier to to support files

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,060
we of course fix issues that are

00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,070
reported to the project there are

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,990
various ways people tend to report

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,720
issues to the project but we try to fix

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,910
them when they when we are welp them and

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,830
then I mean we can make any change on

00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,930
the project I mean whether it's in fact

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,300
that you're testing in faster changes

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,919
script changes anything so basically

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,010
every six month there is a there are

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,500
bunch of changes that we make and that

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,050
can want not the consequence of that is

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,700
that it might be sometimes it might

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,170
actually be difficult for people to keep

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,160
up with the amount of changes and

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,930
upgrading every six months my

00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,509
actually be a slightly more difficult

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:05,000
than people had wished so we can add new

00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:07,579
architecture when that comes and and any

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,440
kind of change one thing which this is

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:11,779
actually quite good with this six-month

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,079
release cycle is that we have very tight

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:17,269
integration with upstreams so I mean

00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:20,209
which means that if you use the latest

00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:22,730
Yocto release you will be running very

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:24,259
likely most of the rest and the most

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,069
recent software for everything I mean

00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:30,410
all the core components of the Linux OS

00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:32,600
we also do step already so after we make

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:36,410
the fall in a predict it is we make the

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,480
dot it is not 1 or 2 etc we have some

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,160
very strict rules about what we do and

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,709
how we manage these branches

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,110
the first one is it's very strict back

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:47,600
for policies or you your change must be

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,750
in master first and then it will be back

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,420
ported what we accept in the stable

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,310
branch it is only like I mean bug fixes

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,579
or security fixes we don't make changes

00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:01,730
a grade of component we don't break API

00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:03,740
we don't get a new feature it's really

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,779
about stability and fixes so that's the

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,259
process we are following with stable IDs

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:11,439
the testing is very much the same as

00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:15,139
what we usually do with the regularities

00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:19,250
so it all looks good but there are some

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:20,839
challenges along the what we usually do

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,490
in terms of the maintenance we do for

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,600
the releases we try to maintain the last

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,370
two previously released and why we work

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,259
in the next videos so basically that

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:34,699
gives like a maintenance we do a window

00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:38,089
up to one year which is not enough again

00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:41,029
sometimes for some specific use cases to

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,309
deal with I mean support the work is

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,319
done thanks falsely for people that

00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,209
volunteer that walk it's mostly

00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:50,209
community time and it's not something

00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:52,550
that is founded or financed by the

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,959
project is basically thanks to the

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,350
community that we are able to do this

00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:59,750
thing the testing which is basically the

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,809
same has been the same so far as what

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,100
the project is doing is relying on some

00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:07,100
manual testing which is done by some of

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,810
our members so basically we have used

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,090
doing some overhead

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,860
on some of the member races for the

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,780
manual testing so that's actually that's

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:20,900
seen as a challenge and it's been it's

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:22,340
been an issue at times so we've talked

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,230
about the project we've talked about the

00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,470
release the current release the stable

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:30,320
release process over the last two years

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:33,640
there's been acid changes in how we do a

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,460
CI and a test automation for the project

00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,830
we've revisited completely the way we do

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,310
the CI infrastructure on the CI loop

00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:46,910
with new out new version of the auto

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,070
builder and we are also about new other

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,530
way to add your own our infrastructure

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,920
so we've have today I mean like

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:57,560
something like 25 recent servers to

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,610
builders and we validate more than 12 a

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,200
host distribution so that's that that's

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,820
a fresh of the infrastructure was a

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,460
fairly large expense for the project

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,020
last year that was very much needed to

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,760
actually modernize the builder and I

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,790
mean actually spend less time waiting

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,280
for the bills to complete so that was

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,920
one part of the change the other part

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,140
has been also discussed quite a bit last

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,570
year in various places in articles but

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,570
there has been a lot of work to what you

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,820
reduced the need for manual testing so

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,250
we we used to have a huge amount of

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,340
manual testing everywhere in the system

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,560
even I mean like in in every piece of

00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,770
the system and a lot of work has been

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,510
put together led by Richard and the rest

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,720
of the community to actually try to do

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,490
more and more test automation whether

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,930
it's be running more pee tests and

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,790
addicts for four more pee tests

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,940
be test is the the test automation we

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:56,780
use for packages in in openembedded the

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,810
we've been extending and running LTP and

00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:03,230
we've also done a lot of test automation

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,820
in terms of Tesco productivity what what

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,150
we end up with basically is when we do

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,700
like a full automated test for build we

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,430
almost are in two million tests in eight

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,560
hours across all architecture that we

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,170
are in Jersey so it's a and if you are

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,880
if you knew if you if you had seen what

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,750
we were doing in the past I mean this is

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,070
like a stunning number that

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:27,390
we can do today so all in all the

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,160
limitation and the issues and that we

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,950
have seen with the stability is and the

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:36,390
improvement that we have seen in terms

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:40,230
of automated testing I've led and open

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:44,100
up the discussion for for LTS so how it

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,630
happened and why it happened the sixth

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,570
as we said I mean the six-month period

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,460
ends it lines very well with the pace of

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,670
open source I mean open source does I

00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,520
mean

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,630
release as often as possible and that's

00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,950
that's actually really good

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,920
however when when we have some people

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,870
using the Yocto project and trying to

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,240
make some of product from their own use

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,950
case in on some specific markets making

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,190
a product takes more than six months so

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,540
basically by the time you are ready to

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,530
make your product ship your product I

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,200
mean you're already using

00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:20,130
Raley's which is not the latest one so

00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,840
we've what we see is that many many

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,550
companies out there that are using the

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,940
Yocto project is they just end up doing

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,620
the own LTS own so basically what they

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,930
do is they start their own they pick a

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,010
release and obviously I mean if a

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,310
company is going to pick a different

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,530
ladies and everybody is a train going to

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,200
try to do I mean LTS on the on trying to

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,330
back port security fixes buy it back for

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,880
the big fixes and so on and most of the

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,320
time what we see is they do that behind

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,020
closed doors I mean we don't even know

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,630
about what's happening so over the years

00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,470
it has become like one of the big

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,390
complain

00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,450
main complain that we share when we meet

00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:00,120
I mean developers at the events that we

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,670
organize the buff that we do at I mean

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,890
the LF events that's what we hear I mean

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:08,760
people who like the project to make a

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:11,850
decision and do something about LTS so

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:16,410
what happened is that at the last year's

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,120
EE it was in October 2009 gene DTSC has

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,740
come up with the proposal to the

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,670
governing board on how and what we

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,790
should be doing for LTS there has been

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,470
obviously a bunch of discussions within

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,110
the governing board about I mean whether

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,930
that I mean why and the value of doing

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,820
that and and paws and combs and Stata

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,100
and we've been there

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,150
P that we were able to announce back in

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,760
I mean mouse-like

00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:44,520
earlier in March that we would be doing

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,880
LTS moving forward so you have the link

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,620
to the announcement here so again I mean

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,480
what is important here is the process

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,490
and how things happen I mean so that's

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,610
how all the changes that have happened

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,220
so I mean we were in a position to for

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,850
the TAC to make the popular so what the

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:06,090
LTS focus that is I mean at least from

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:09,420
the high-level perspective so we want to

00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,680
have an LCS every two years so we want

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,110
to have something which is predictable

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,120
people know when the next LTS is and

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,000
people can realize so the idea is that

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,670
we want to all the companies that use

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,230
the octopod and that need LTS instead of

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,300
picking their own version that will

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,370
start aligning on one single version so

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,530
at least we align all the companies out

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,390
there on a single version the project

00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:33,540
will maintain that LTS for two years

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,040
it's it won't be like for one year as we

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,370
do today it will be I mean maintained

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,680
for two years the maintenance of that

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,360
branch will actually be founded by the

00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,970
Yocto project membership it won't be

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,310
community time so we have evaluated that

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,770
or we have basically approve a budget

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,920
for someone who worked on it I mean half

00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:54,210
time basically as maintainer official

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,250
maintenance for that branch and we

00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,920
expect that it should actually be a very

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,750
helpful for the project we are currently

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,910
I mean in process of hiring and trying

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,310
to finalize and finds find someone and

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,970
we will be announcing that data in April

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:11,610
the next cut is in April or actually

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,439
very soon now 3.1 it is will be the

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:16,010
first LTS so everybody is aware and that

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,089
this is going to be the first LTS and

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,520
hopefully what we will see is that

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:25,290
people will start aligning their use of

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,449
the release throughout this phase one

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,340
consequence of that because we have this

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,390
LTS every two years that will be

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,940
maintained for two years that the

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,620
intermediate stabilized so the one that

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,600
will not be LTS

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,430
we will reduce the maintenance to seven

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,470
month seven months so that it actually

00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,750
is helpful for companies that want to

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,340
switch from release to release they have

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,990
like a window where they they are still

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,210
maintained for the current release until

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,380
the next car is ready and so on so

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,970
that's that's stopped

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,740
basically what we think is with this

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,350
setup we are going to authorize the need

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,850
of people who want to use switch from

00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,820
ladies to varies without to worry about

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,220
the LTS we also want to address the need

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,440
for companies that are very ensures into

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,300
the LTS and finally of course we don't

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,430
want to discourage anyone to leave a

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,670
master and just keep using mastered keep

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,020
develop developing against master branch

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,180
of course everything remains and the

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,160
other responsibilities of the GSE the

00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,610
LTS various processes the regular

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,860
process and the the maintainer so the

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,050
maintainer will basically report this

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:30,690
time and is basically report is walk to

00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:33,090
the dr. tastes a bit more

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,340
details about what we want to do the

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,440
components that we will be covering the

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,660
component are included into the Yocto

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,420
project released today so same as in the

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,210
very first slide bitbake week or met a

00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,400
doctor doctor documentation of course we

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,890
are not going to cover all the layers

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,130
that exists especially I mean Metairie

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,960
is not included every vendors and yes

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,320
ten different layers are not included we

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,760
will probably encourage every owners of

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,220
these layers and maintain of these

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,900
layers to align with ours I mean the

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,330
Yocto project ideas process and arrays

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,870
as well and we think it will happen all

00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:13,590
the time what we will do is we will only

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:15,660
support a subset of the achieve build

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,400
platform talking about the hostage-taker

00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,540
basically what you use on your host I

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,820
mean as you know I mean the Yocto

00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,120
project puts a wide variety of Hostess

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,100
top all the time it's very complex what

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,670
you learn like an old version of octo on

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,890
like a day resignation of like one of

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,810
the in exist also will see and will

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,910
announce when we start the LTS forever

00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,740
it is which exactly store we support but

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,480
you might expect were like things like

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,280
open two files and the LTS will be

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,090
supported so with that will be announced

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,710
when we actually make the readies we

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,510
have some tools and mechanisms

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,490
it's called build tools where we

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,220
actually generates some binaries that

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,410
are useful to run to build an all the

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,330
version of octo with annuity store which

00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:01,070
we hope will be also useful people and

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,970
we seen and we see I mean as time goes

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,250
in terms of the test

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,950
we also make some change we will rely on

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,890
the project auto builder of course and

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,570
we will only run automated testing the

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,760
improvement that I've been mentioning

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,650
before and we will only run on

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,080
virtualized platforms we will not be

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,110
earning on any actual hardware so what

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,480
the product is doing is we will maintain

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,299
LTS for the project as a whole but we

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,429
will not be testing on actual artwork

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:32,250
there are tools like CV checks or CV

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,929
tools that we will look at using and

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,760
deploying as well to make sure that we

00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:44,730
understand what we are doing in terms of

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:46,760
security fixes so what it is what is not

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,470
we've had some interesting discussions

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,620
on the mailing list since we've made the

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,220
announcement just to clarify so what

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:59,280
what this is this is a major change for

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,789
the project it's a significant expense

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,380
for the membership and that's that's our

00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:06,690
response to something that we've heard

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,270
over the many years about something that

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,400
was needed for the project it's an

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,770
initiative where we want to create a

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,750
place for everybody to collaborate again

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,549
by making sure that every two years

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,640
there is one main radius which will

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:22,380
become a yes we expect that people we

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,289
start all working against the same

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,059
branch at least the companies that are I

00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:30,380
mean willing to help and willing to use

00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,970
the yes and we want to make sure that

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,400
people will start a more collaboration

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,740
so we have we will provide a full time

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,309
and meant enough for the branch founded

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,809
about by the project that engineer won't

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,610
be enough to work we fix all the bugs

00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,830
and all the security fix but what we

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,750
hope is that we will create the

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,460
opportunity for everybody to collaborate

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,140
and work with this maintainer and the

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,039
rest of the community to make sure that

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,990
our LTS gets better and better

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,460
it's it's something we definitely we

00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,840
have a guarantee that we will have all

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,909
the resource available to do the

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,549
integration of all the patches that we

00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:08,340
see that addressed against the LTS and

00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:09,929
we have testing resources as well so

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,210
that we can actually make readies and

00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,429
fast release as much as needed one issue

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,860
that I've not said I mean we didn't have

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:19,080
mechanism to do fast theories before I

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,090
stable it is today time eerie crowd like

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,470
the food testing cycle including manual

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:27,290
testing and so on so that was never

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:29,700
ready like fast days so as important as

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,309
it's also very important to say what it

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,500
is not it's definitely not a replacement

00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,420
for anybody out there that actually

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,700
offers commercial support I mean there

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,890
are many companies that are in the Yocto

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,400
project ecosystem who is visit actually

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,750
offer like very long-term support I we

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,660
are talking five years ten years and

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,910
probably even more I'm sure that's not

00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,070
what we want to do what we want to do is

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,440
to enable I mean the community work

00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,840
together at least to enable one men 80s

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,419
every two years we won't be able to

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,630
guarantee that every single CV fixes

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,460
will be there and will be indicated its

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,320
we have we guarantee that we have

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,520
somebody that will be there to work with

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,740
the rest of the community and the rest

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,630
of the companies but there is no

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,440
guarantee that all say we will be fixed

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,900
and of course we won't be checking I

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,660
mean like custom I mean every product is

00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,000
going to be using many different layers

00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:30,000
so what we will be doing is LTS for the

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,280
core components as I mentioned so with

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,549
that said how you can help how can you

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,340
help us there are definitely many

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:40,559
different ways the first one is what we

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:44,070
really hope is that everybody we start

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,570
contributing ensure bug fixes CV and

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,040
security patches I mean that's the most

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,480
important thing I mean if we all work

00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,700
together I mean that will actually make

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,500
the project will look better for

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,110
available years so that's that's what we

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,030
all want in the end we want to everybody

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,010
to share a little bit of the pain of the

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,900
maintenance and this and and the bug

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,780
fixes and then we enable that and make

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:06,150
it easy for everybody else you can test

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,559
the earth yes I mean nobody makes a

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,299
product with just the October is

00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,040
everybody adds their own destroy their

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,200
own base port and so on so test

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,160
LTS test video this notice your best

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,679
spot and report the bugs and of course

00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,450
we for us I mean we started the LTS but

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,250
we don't want to stop I mean the

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,440
development of the project I mean master

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,900
branch remains our main development vine

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,669
so if you if you use master vengeance

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,660
you develop against master continue to

00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,030
do so

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,210
don't want I mean only the energy has to

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:38,010
be there we definitely want to see more

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,950
and more contribution on master winch as

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,530
well and one thing you can do as well if

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,120
you if you can as well is join the Yocto

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,420
project and support your two project and

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,720
become a member the hope is that this

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:54,240
LCS thing will give us more membership

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,670
eventually and we can probably extend I

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,450
mean maybe the duration or what we do

00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:03,930
for the LCS and so on and so on so I

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:05,790
think I think it's 25 minutes and on the

00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:12,150
last slides I mean you have various ways

00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:13,670
you can find us and NHL to us I think

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,200
that's yeah and so thanks for listening

00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,150
if you have any specific questions I

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,470
mean you can join one of the mailing
