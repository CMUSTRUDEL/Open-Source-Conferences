in the cloud and we are recording okay

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,250
so thanks everyone for joining today

00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,889
we've invited Manny from the llanera

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,220
developer services team to talk to us

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,410
about Laura and Zephyr so I'm gonna hand

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,859
it over to you Manny thank you hey

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,119
thanks for Viki hello everyone so myself

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,060
man even in surrattsville

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,760
I work as a kernel engineer at developer

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,529
services team of llanera

00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,590
so I contribute to Zephyr in my spare

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,920
time so I mostly do the Association both

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,719
supports so I was previously a tireless

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,879
export stream of llanera so that

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,079
explains why because we had a lot of

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,570
boots there and I do maintain the led

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,870
API in Suffern which is pretty small and

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,350
basic but recently I got a chance to

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,320
work on Lotus I put in Zephyr and that's

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,440
what the talk is all about so let's get

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,530
started so this is the agenda for

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,689
today's talk so I'm not going to cover

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,280
the entire basics of flora or this is

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,220
not a deep dive session of Laura

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,710
instead I'll be just talking about the

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,250
Laura implementation in suffer a bit of

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:25,200
history of what happened and what's the

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,970
motivation behind that and also I'll

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,610
just talk a little bit about the future

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,799
goals what we want to achieve and then

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,640
I'll also talk about the community which

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:40,680
is growing around this Laura our load of

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,890
an effort in surfer okay so what is

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,770
Laura so Laura is an acronym of long

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,229
range so it's basically a LP one

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,659
wireless technology based on the chips

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,170
bit spectrum modulation technique so

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,770
this modulation technique uses the chip

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,320
pulses with the linear variation of

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,070
frequency to encode information on a

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,399
medium which is sad so Laura is based on

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,410
that modulation technique Laura uses a

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,710
slightly modified version of CSS

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:17,130
modulation so it's not entirely CSS

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,930
and laureates in the license-free subdue

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,510
its frequency range which of course

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,510
varies with locations and which is a

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,410
you

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:35,950
oh this sorry man you dropped out

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:40,120
momentarily we was talking about the the

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:43,570
the frequency range oops sorry I don't

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,080
know what happened and no worry yeah so

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,520
actually load up it's in lessons free

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,520
subjects frequency range which varies

00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,680
with locations so we have eight sixty

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,690
five minutes allocated for Laura in

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:04,420
India and 865 18 euro 915 in Australia

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:07,000
etc just let me know if I'm dropping so

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,250
this Laura technology was originally

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,910
developed by sigh clear so it was a

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:16,450
company based on France so there are a

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,489
team of three like-minded people wanted

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:22,090
to develop a communication technology

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:24,750
for metering applications so that

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,310
company got later acquired by Simtek and

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,880
sent it helped them to develop the first

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:35,709
Laura radio which is SX 1 to 72 and then

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:38,320
s x12 7/6 later and also same tech

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,239
develop the Laura band which is a Mac

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,230
protocol to provide true networking

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,709
support to Laura

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:48,330
so since Laura is pretty much the radio

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:51,280
stuff you cannot do any more networking

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,410
with only plain Laura so that's the

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,310
motivation behind developing this Laura

00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:00,400
vent stack and finally alluro Alliance

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,110
was formed with interested parties to

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,140
support and promote the Laura van

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,410
adduction globally and this effort is

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:13,420
chill spreaded by Celtic but it's coming

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:15,760
through the Laura Lyons now so this is

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,709
the network topology of Laura van so as

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,780
I said before Laura is just the Pikachu

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:26,470
a layer so in terms of OSI and Laura van

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:31,479
is the Mac software because I think I

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:34,030
need to move this thing okay so Laura

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,440
mines just the max of player because I

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,000
haven't really seen any physical

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,060
implementation of the lore event

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,760
protocol it's

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,610
mostly it will be a stack running on the

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,060
target MCU which is controlling the end

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,710
node so that mine so you will talk to

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,110
the lower Pikachu I using spy

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,440
communication protocol and then it will

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,900
transmit the data etcetera so the Lord

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,470
of protocol is closed it is proprietary

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,600
to sim tech but the lore events stack is

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,550
open which means the specification is

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,890
open and also that is a reference

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,590
implementation available in the semtex

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,890
critic repository so anyone can just use

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,810
it without paying anything but the only

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:20,450
catch is that they have to use the Laura

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,950
radio for transporting the data but I

00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,350
have seen some pretty interesting works

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,170
like using this low demand stack on top

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,130
of ble so actually you don't need to pay

00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,000
for the Laura

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:35,160
anyway and so what Gavin works in the

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,990
star topology which means all the end

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,750
nodes need to communicate to the

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,880
centralized gateway transmitting the

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,700
data and then the Gateway will in turn

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,790
relay all the messages to network server

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:52,370
and the application server but when you

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:55,380
take the Laura PHY alone you can do p2p

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,080
between two end nodes or between an end

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,210
node and a gateway so that won't involve

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,130
any sort of networking communication is

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,100
just transmitting and receiving the data

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,830
mainly but if you want that then you

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,020
need to have the Lola man in place so in

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,110
Laura man the communication between end

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,180
node and gateway so a node and gate bit

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,520
happens through Laura technology and

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,230
then the communication between gateway

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:26,160
and network server happens through the

00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:29,850
standard tcp/ip mechanism okay so here

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,480
comes why is the fornix Laura so I'm

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,210
just presenting here an industrial

00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,940
application perspective so when you want

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,730
suffer to be the authors for industrial

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,250
applications you need to multitasking

00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,740
support and that's what this guy is

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,419
doing here and we we do have the

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,539
multitasking support in Zephyr so that's

00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,650
the this is kicked off and then we need

00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:55,650
to have the mistress

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:59,009
guidelines adopted so this effort has

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,080
been started in Suffern even though

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:04,350
there are still debates going on whether

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,630
this mr. Siegel and should adapt to all

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:09,900
the source code or apart from kernel and

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:13,110
also whether we should use all the

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,150
guidelines in the misra I mean all the

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,919
rules in the mr. guidelines so it's

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,550
still debatable but we are progressing

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,130
and I'm pretty sure that in some point

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,699
of time and future therefore will become

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:29,310
a Miss recycling compatible notice

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:31,620
you'll see that and of course we need to

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,990
have the security in place and Zephyr is

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,090
pretty good in terms of security I can

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:39,360
say that because we have our own

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,669
security guidelines and that is a

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,669
support for cryptographic algorithms

00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:49,830
based on external apposite trees like

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:51,509
tiny crypt or ember TLS and yeah it's

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,280
pretty good in terms of security when

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:56,880
you compare it with other open-source

00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,260
orthosis but the only thing which is not

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,910
in place for Zephyr to be an

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,150
industrial-grade artist is the

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,949
communication technology so we do have

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,320
support for a few communication

00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:14,220
technologies like Bluetooth Wi-Fi etc

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:17,340
but those really fall into that 2.3 2.4

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,220
gig frequency band which is overly

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,020
crowded and then boundary interference

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:25,710
so what the industrial applications want

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,320
is and wireless communication technology

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,990
in a less polluted space that's where

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,169
Laura comes into picture and since it

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,469
operates in the subjects frequency band

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:40,289
which is not at the moment only

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:41,570
populated because the world just went

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,670
with 2.4 gig

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,190
so that makes Laura a perfect choice for

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,310
industrial applications and when we add

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,860
Laura support in Zephyr we can say that

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,950
Zephyr will become a best bet for an

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,050
industrial-grade artists so that's the

00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,780
entire motivation behind adding Laura

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,610
supporting Zephyr

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:06,230
so if we have if you have any questions

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:10,070
feel free to interrupt me okay so here

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:14,420
comes the history so the part one

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:16,640
actually covers therefore taken by other

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:20,420
community members not me

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,790
so it's just a prehistory of me so the

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,800
first issue for adding loader support in

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:30,080
Suffern was opened by a community user

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:33,590
back in 2017 so he just opened a PR

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,960
issue to discuss whether is there any

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,660
plan to support Laura in Suffern or not

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,760
and then later a couple of folks jumping

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,250
and then shared their views they

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,720
expressed their interest in adding Laura

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,840
supporting stuffer and then the

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,240
discussion went on and later Kate Steve

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,140
Ott from the next foundation also in

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,170
this effort charged

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,990
she opened the feature request issue and

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:01,760
give suffer for adding the lower floor

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:05,089
of banned or lower radius support so she

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,230
mentioned industrial applications is one

00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:12,620
of the use case of adding gyro support

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,870
in Zephyr and that's correct yeah so

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,660
after some time ding Tao one of the

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,600
community user open their first hour of

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,180
CPR to support Laura ban it's not law

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,660
rights he just directed support order of

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,710
man

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:30,589
so that pull request was just plainly

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:33,320
opened without no intention to merge it

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:37,130
to suffer main line so he mentioned that

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,530
clearly but he was he was open if

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,620
someone could take that and then make it

00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:44,450
ready to get merged into Zephyr but he

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,710
had no intentions to merge this by

00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:51,260
himself so that's why he has had a no

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:55,610
here at a no API and both support it was

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:59,450
just plain of comets which sure we just

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,430
included the Laura Mac Laura Mac

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,240
reference implementation from Zephyr

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:08,120
sorry from cynic and then he had couple

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,960
of commits for adding the SX 1 to 7 2

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,930
and SX 1 to 7 6 loner radios

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,140
so that was a bit of discussion happened

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,029
on the API design how we want to

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,180
integrate this floral support in surfer

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:24,350
etc and after some times the PR got

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,820
closed by the author

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:32,149
so that's somewhat disappointing and

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,790
here comes the part two so this part two

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,250
how was the effort taken by me for

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:41,120
adding the lower support in Suffern so I

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:43,850
have a opened the hour of CPR to discuss

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,149
the basic pleura API implementation we

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:50,000
should note that I hasn't opened a PR to

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:52,220
add laurel and support I just wanted to

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,640
have the Laura's support in place which

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,950
is just the radio or PHY for doing the

00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,410
basic b2b communication and then later

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,180
on extending that to Laura van because I

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,790
always work with start small and then

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,180
build it back principal okay

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:11,870
so I proposed the basic Laura API and

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,959
then the design to the community so I

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,660
also used 96 ports history as the target

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,750
platform because at the time that was

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:24,350
the only board which had Laura and it

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:28,670
had Zephyr running so I still have only

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,740
one okay so I haven't I hasn't tree I

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,339
have to use the syntax reference code

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,920
which is the Laura Mac no repository in

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:40,910
my original implementation so my idea

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,310
was to use simplex repository only for

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,800
the Mac layer implementation and not for

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,959
the radio and stuff etc for radios I

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,490
wanted as effort to host the native

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:56,209
drivers but that idea was turned down

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:59,200
and Thomas I don't know how to pronounce

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:02,870
his last name but he not that we are

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,180
asking me to reuse the Laura at node

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:09,290
repository for the radio works so

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:11,870
because he was try it because he wanted

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,420
to avoid the code duplication because it

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:18,589
already had the radio driver and it

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:23,000
makes sense to reuse that so so I was

00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:24,780
confused and then okay I just accepted

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,500
that and then I went

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:33,930
to rework my design so at the drawing

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:36,540
board initial idea and then later I came

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:39,810
up with another version of the PR so

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,100
this time I had reused septic stack so

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:47,070
which was pretty good so I added a blue

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,620
driver for interfacing with semtex repo

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,960
and then surfer and then still there was

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,300
no Laura and support added I was just

00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:58,110
concentrating on Laura API at that

00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,030
moment and I had added syntax Laura

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,860
macro repository as a zephyr module

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:05,730
because I talked to a few people and

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,320
then like Carles from Nordic and he

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,080
suggested me to add it as a module

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,500
because that's the proper way of using

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,460
an external repository in Zephyr so this

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,410
time I got positive reviews and I have

00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,830
splitted the boat specific parts from

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,140
that PR and then we merged them

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,990
separately so I should thank everyone

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:32,700
for giving their suggestion it just

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:36,870
speeded up the process and roughly after

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,390
three months the PR got posted we

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,500
finally merged it to mainland Zephyr and

00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:47,610
then I had some sort of excitement a

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:51,540
okay so here comes the Laura

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:54,120
implementation detail so this is the

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:57,290
basic API I provided in the p2p supports

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,970
so we had API for configuring the modem

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,100
and then we had ApS for sending and

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,700
receiving data it's pretty simple just

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,910
these three api's configure I mean

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,530
making most of the internal order radio

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:15,840
so the initial flow I had in mind was

00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:18,360
configure the radio for send on C and

00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,540
then just send a receive but if you want

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,730
to change the functionality like if you

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:27,270
have configured the modem for sending

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,470
but if you want to make the modem

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,260
receive then you need to do the

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,000
configuration one second so this is sort

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,000
of the design decision I took at that

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,499
time in order to keep the API simple but

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,629
I knew that it won't scale because

00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:43,059
users only want to configure the modem

00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:46,989
only once and then they they'll need to

00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:48,999
send or receive at any time later so

00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,739
this is going to get changed we are

00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:53,559
having discussions in our community in

00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:56,079
the slack Channel about modifying this

00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,379
API and to aid this purpose I have

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,029
marked this Laura API as experimental so

00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:05,459
that all the changes can be made easily

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:09,339
so second acts the way to do that really

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:13,119
all right so here is the configuration

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:16,209
structure used for controlling the modem

00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:18,759
so the frequency parameter determines at

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:22,419
what frequency the modem is operating so

00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:25,839
I it will become 865 for India and 868

00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:28,959
for Europe etc and that is a bandwidth

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,789
parameter in that Laura is pretty strict

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,849
in terms of bandwidth so there are only

00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:37,839
three bandits allowed 124 o'clock its

00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:41,289
250 and then 500 so you need to choose

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,529
anyone on that among that and then we

00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:46,539
have data right so data rate in Laura is

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:49,059
actually corresponds to the spreading

00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:53,319
factor so spreading factor is just the

00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:56,289
time on air so if you have the spreading

00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:58,179
factor SQL oh it starts from 7 and goes

00:16:56,289 --> 00:17:00,849
up to 12 so if you have the spreading

00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:05,049
factor equal to 7 the data can be

00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:07,449
transmitted more fastly but it won't

00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:09,519
reach longer distances so if you want to

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,199
cover longer distance then of course you

00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,539
need to increase the spreading factor

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,419
and then in turn the radar it will get

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:20,679
reduced so this is just a trade off in

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:22,000
Laura you need to choose your use case I

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,449
mean you need to choose depending upon

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,070
your use case so we have coding rate so

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:31,690
coding rate is just the portion of

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,200
portion in the transmitted bits which is

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,029
contribute to the payload so you need to

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,490
choose that depending upon your use case

00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:42,279
also of course and then that's preamble

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,440
length DX power and then TX flag

00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:48,220
so there's tips flag is internal to

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,980
Zephyr this is used for confident the

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,360
modem for TX or rx purposes and of

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:58,840
course this will get removed when

00:17:52,360 --> 00:18:01,870
the API in future so okay I mentioned

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,820
that we have I have we used the Lola Mac

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:08,890
noir which is the reference repository

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:11,530
from sim tech but I had built that

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,510
liability module as a library

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,730
in order to avoid that namespace issues

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,740
because there are many symbols which

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,020
were more common between the Laura

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,000
Magnolia poetry and then suffer because

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,250
Laura McClure is used as a standalone

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,470
repository for the application

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,360
development so of course it has few

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,669
symbols which were defined in both of

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,520
the repositories so I had to build it as

00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:35,740
a library in order to avoid those issues

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,230
and thanks to Alexander Worcester

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,360
because he really gave me that

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,490
suggestion to do that because I never

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:49,410
know that these kind of things existed

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:53,200
in Zephyr this is pretty good ok so I

00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,730
recently I had some it'll put a quest

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,020
for adding the Laura van support in

00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:01,270
Suffern so the basic idea is that Laura

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,809
van will live as a subsystem and their

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,880
success a hierarchy so this Laura van

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:10,419
support will reuse the existing Laura

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,940
drivers based on the Laura API to send

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:16,299
and receive packets and then we don't

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,620
need to modify anything in the Zephyr

00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:22,960
Laura McNaughton

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:25,690
because we have just we are just reusing

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,130
all parts of the code without doing any

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,520
modification in the original repository

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,070
so we have a strict policy like if we

00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,290
want to modify anything in the Laura

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,260
mark note repository then you need to do

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:41,140
it upstream first and then only then you

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,690
can inherit in the Zephyr module so we

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,750
can't really touch anything to make it

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,750
messy so but we need to enable few

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,820
drivers in that repository but that's

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:57,820
done separately without touching the

00:19:51,820 --> 00:20:00,340
core repository but the only thing which

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:04,390
is tough in Laura one is API design

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,710
because Laura one is somewhat complex

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,350
and

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,240
designing an APA is hard because Laura

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:13,120
GaN is a mixed bag of synchronous and

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,760
asynchronous operations because when you

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,360
sender any data that is synchronous but

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,940
the receive receiving is almost a

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,860
synchronous because you have classes we

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,560
have different time slots for losing the

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,870
data if I want to talk about that then I

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,550
need to expand the whole lore event

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,080
specification I don't want to do that

00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,570
but I have added the laura1

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,750
specification in my speaker notes feel

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,430
free to check it out later so and then

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,600
there are blocking and non blocking

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:45,940
operations in Luo man so some of the

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,070
send and receive kam talk block in the

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,020
sense it can wait for getting the

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,040
confirmation from the Gateway or network

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,840
server but some of the operations can

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,840
just return without blocking just send

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,880
the data return so we have different

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,490
sort of combinations in the alors events

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,040
so designing a common API is somewhat

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,230
tricky so still we have the discussion

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,020
ongoing and hopefully we will reach a

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,570
conclusion sooner and then we have the

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:16,630
whole different problem of storing the

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,670
keys and States in the local end node

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:23,230
because the end node is not so smart

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,780
basically there will be a context n 0 or

00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,820
M 3 M C running in the end nodes there

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,180
won't be any provision for adding the

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:35,500
TPMS or any sort of security modules for

00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:37,510
stowing the keys but no Damac node

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,460
reference reference tag has a soft

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,070
knocking soft secure element

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,250
implementation which is used for storing

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:48,220
the keys etc but I guess right now I am

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,580
just reusing it in my open PR but we are

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,700
having discussions on how to how to use

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,350
the existing storage implementation I

00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,420
think we have storage subsystem in

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,460
Zephir and we are discussing on how to

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,680
use that subsystem for storing the keys

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:05,400
securely and then if there are any

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,780
hardware accelerators how can we get

00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:12,910
benefit from that so we are discussing

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:16,210
that all right I think this is going to

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:19,809
be the last slide and the session is

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,240
it's a shark so we do have a community

00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:25,389
for the Laura relevant effort in Suffern

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,100
so that is a slack channel created by me

00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:29,799
it's called Zephyr lunar man feel free

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,409
to join and we have more active members

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,059
now because when I open the slack

00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:36,519
channel that I was it was only me and

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:37,720
then a couple of developers but right

00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,480
now it's just growing and then it

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,990
creates 17 so more members started to

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,210
join and then more importantly they are

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,580
willing to contribute to this effort

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,769
which is pretty good for me because I

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,350
won't work on the Laura support

00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:56,320
full-time it just makes bad time thing

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:58,240
so since they are very active in

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,549
contributing I was all happy to just

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,299
review and then make things go smoothly

00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:06,159
so a couple of times and resubmitted PR

00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,639
for improving the Laura support and

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,269
there was a existing PR to add a six one

00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:17,139
two six six videos and then there was a

00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:20,200
proposal to add more boats to this more

00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:23,529
I mean more boats using the Laura and

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,629
subtract so that's good and then I'm

00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:27,970
pretty sure that once we add this load

00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:31,210
of van support in Zephyr the activity is

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,820
going to get increased because if only

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,590
Laura we can't do much but only once we

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,720
open the love and support I think it

00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,759
will attract a lot of people and then

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,749
more companies may start to invest that

00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:46,539
time and effort to make this support

00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:48,100
better and then I they might even use

00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,779
this Laura and then Zephyr

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,940
implementation in their end product so

00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:57,759
that will pay away for that alright

00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,029
that's about it is there any questions

00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,029
for me

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,900
I'm curious if are you aware of an EMC

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:12,810
use that actually have the same black

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:15,870
radio integrated either so I think SD

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:18,120
has released something I haven't deeply

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:22,140
looked into that and but I've seen in

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,510
the PRS like a whole MC of integrated

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,150
radio and such but I'm I don't really

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:29,990
know the internal details of it but what

00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:32,400
we have now is just a module like in the

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,610
mystery aboard we have a module called

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,590
Rach Rach eight one one it has the it's

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:41,640
a kind of sip module where you have the

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:43,590
MCU and Laura radio integrated so yeah

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,330
that just seems like the issue that I

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,040
was here come up again and again that

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,830
you're limited to SEMATECH radios and

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:53,340
there's no MCU that integrated like

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:55,940
there is with say yeah you know to that

00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:03,180
15.4 with Nordic ships or whoever else

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:05,160
yeah that's right go ahead yeah but

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,750
right now syntax is just the main key

00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,180
player in developing the loader

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,360
applications sorry Laura solutions

00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:17,250
because of course they own the design

00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:19,050
and the modulation technique that's the

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,550
reason why I always hear people not

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,200
wanting to adopt Laura is that they're

00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:28,430
afraid that it only depends on a single

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:30,600
vendor using a single chip yeah yeah

00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:32,760
is the technology interesting but

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,270
they're afraid of Simtek just depending

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,520
entirely on them yeah and yeah like I

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,890
mentioned before I have seen use cases

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:46,440
where the Laura van stack gets reused on

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:47,520
top of ble so that's an option if you

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,470
have a link or something we'll be

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,380
interested to see what they're doing

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,150
there yeah sure I think I read somewhere

00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,170
maybe I can't the video too and share it

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,820
with you later

00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,920
sure yeah I'd be interested just because

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,410
the advantage of ble is every telephone

00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,840
and in three-quarters of the mobile

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,850
devices that they're supported ble I do

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,410
like Laura but I was yeah it's an

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,750
interesting combination to be using with

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,750
them yeah true that

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,060
have you have you done any tests with

00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,080
range also because Laura sounds nice on

00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:22,430
paper and they make a lot of big

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:25,460
promises about range yeah so yeah I I

00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:27,590
haven't really done any tests but

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,920
everything what I read on range is

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:33,640
theoretical and of course we we do have

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,350
our partners Rock Wireless is one of the

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,590
96 ports partner developing the Laura

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:42,890
solutions and they have done some on

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,690
field testing but I haven't done that

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,700
personally and it really depends on the

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,620
environment you're testing yeah

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,140
absolutely anything RF but it just I

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,180
kind of I haven't tried myself so I've

00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,510
no I've no opinion I've just heard that

00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:58,550
maybe it tends to get oversold the range

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,650
because it's it's sort of this perfect

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:04,340
ideal situation where they talk about

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,840
kilometers of range but yeah even with

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,880
eight six eight or nine fifteen

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,830
megahertz you can get good range even

00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,930
with low power like twenty thirty minute

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,360
she could still get pretty good range in

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:17,330
and it penetrates much better through

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:20,060
concrete than 2.4 so it's good that were

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:23,000
urban environments but the range seems

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,740
to be really oversold it's quite good

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,130
but I'm just just curious if you have

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:30,800
any experience yeah I don't really how

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:34,730
that I mean most of the people just say

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:38,300
that it just supports 10 kilo 10 miles

00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:40,520
which means 15 kilometers but I don't

00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,490
know that that seems like a crazy number

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,410
to me yeah that's right transmit power

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,570
in any favor for you if you're the

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:52,340
farmer's field okay if you're in Idaho I

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:56,180
don't know yeah I'd be curious to see

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,740
the antenna they were using if you're in

00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,450
like the Grand Canyon standing on the

00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:05,090
top of a canyon and someone else on the

00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:06,470
top of another Canyon yeah I'm just

00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,940
curious I really I've been interested in

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,040
Laura for a long time so it's nice to

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:15,380
see somewhere if you're just joining the

00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:17,990
channel the the big issue seems to be

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,900
just the limited delimited

00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,110
silicon options and yeah people that's

00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:27,460
right Mt

00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:30,549
rate of syntek and depending and I have

00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:34,420
read the news somewhere that they have

00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:37,330
started to produce 2.4 gig bigger twice

00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:40,120
so they were starting to move from this

00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:42,360
subjects frequency range and then I

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,940
don't know whether that's effort is to

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,690
make this entire start work with ble

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,150
kind of thing

00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,520
I don't know but Simtek made some

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:54,059
announcements some time back but haven't

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,559
really any seen any news after that I

00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,570
mean one sub one gigahertz makes a lot

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,130
more sense to me especially for the kind

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,600
of market that they're going after with

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,080
industrial applications you don't want

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:10,059
to be a 2.4 yeah like more things in

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,590
like for 433 or 434 but anyway yes eight

00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,450
six eight nine fifty now he seemed good

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,940
I'm just always on the fence between

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,530
should I invest in Laura or should I

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,850
stick to genera at 8:02 dot 15.4

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:25,799
situation maybe you don't get some of

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:28,690
the fancy features but you have yeah

00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,340
yeah Laura seems to be a better option

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,380
for if you want to do some IOT

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:37,330
applications because that entire stack

00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:39,190
is it just made for IOT I would say

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,320
because we have the concept of network

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:44,260
server application server and then you

00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,990
can control take flow using the

00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:50,260
application server it just fits nicely

00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:53,740
for the IOT ecosystem okay and you do

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:56,260
you still have the idea of 15.4 that you

00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,929
you get an acknowledgement you know if a

00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,919
message arrived or not because some

00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:03,370
protocols don't have that but if I send

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,679
a message with with just base 15.4 I

00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:18,090
will know if that arrived or if it

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:18,090
didn't arrive yeah so as I said in here

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:26,380
so that is a thing called confirmed and

00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,880
confirmed messages so that way you can

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,250
get the confirmation from any code

00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:34,150
server that you got network server has

00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:35,920
got the message from end node etc so it

00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,480
will send you an acknowledgment

00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,580
eh and then you can wait for that

00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,560
basically the Laura van stack will do

00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,590
the offloading for you so if we want to

00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,120
send a block blocking send then it will

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,650
make sure that it gets the

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,930
acknowledgement from the network server

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:53,050
else it will written the appropriate

00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,090
error code okay yes I always found that

00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,060
useful and working with 15.4 and it's

00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:00,220
missing some other protocols but it's

00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,200
just the nature of RFU you have to duck

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:08,280
you didn't want to know did this arrive

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:11,590
or not yeah and I still have an idea to

00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,750
implement the socket API on top of floor

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,150
eval so once this loora loora man

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:19,240
support gets in I may want to add that

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:22,270
socket API but that is going to be

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,690
somewhat challenging because the payload

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:27,960
size is quite limited in Laura Laura van

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,040
so of course we need to use some

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,660
fragmenting and then compressing

00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,540
mechanism which is not available in

00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:37,230
Suffern so I was planning to use the SC

00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:41,020
SC which is static header compression

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:43,840
method for actually sending the IP

00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,180
packets over Laura I don't know I don't

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,640
know if it really helps but that seems

00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:52,420
to be a pretty nice you know spare time

00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,790
work for me

00:31:52,420 --> 00:32:02,590
spectrum project what is the maximum

00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:04,930
packet size Laura yeah that varies from

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:08,560
region to region I think it can go up to

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:10,390
220 bytes etc so that really depends on

00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,380
the region you are in and then the data

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:16,780
rate and then the frequency I mean the

00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,790
Kiev's power etc so there's not really a

00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:23,310
maximum size I am really aware of but

00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:26,750
it's in the 200 ish bytes range

00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,750
[Music]

00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,669
that was it for my questions I don't

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,789
know maybe someone else has some some

00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:36,789
questions

00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:50,360
so Manny if things continue the way you

00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:56,779
want when you what's the target for

00:32:50,360 --> 00:33:00,249
getting this into Zephyr Laura Lamia yep

00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:03,499
I think mm we should be able to do that

00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:07,490
maybe for the next release or so not to

00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:12,019
do that three races sometime yeah this

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:15,350
year yeah yep because I was really

00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:18,409
targeting 2.3 back when submitted the

00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:20,330
Laura went PR but it really depends on

00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:23,179
my bandwidth as well because as you know

00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:25,399
so I'm not working full-time on it so it

00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:27,940
really gets it depends on how much time

00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:30,080
I gets for doing this stuff etc and

00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,929
since the community is growing I think

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:38,600
the process will speed up in future and

00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:46,549
more people started to contribute yeah

00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:48,080
that was going to help actually just so

00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:50,899
I can try to get my hands on maybe two

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,200
or three boards um okay so I'm using

00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:57,320
this boat which is con- its moves to

00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,009
this geo so this is one of the IOT

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,330
platform of 96 boats

00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:05,809
it has the Zephyr running and it has

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,669
been ported to run on and Laura runs

00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:09,109
after so everything is working fine on

00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:11,240
this platform and I know a couple of

00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:13,389
folks and community already use it for

00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,389
testing

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:19,429
[Music]

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:21,170
now it's comfy integrated so just by the

00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:24,159
board and you're good to go

00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:27,319
[Music]

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,270
yeah either you can buy couple of the

00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:31,069
boats because the single board you can't

00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,319
do much either you need to buy a gateway

00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,970
and the mystery abode or you need to buy

00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:37,339
a couple of history reports to at least

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,710
to the p2p I was recommend you to buy a

00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:41,990
gateway so if you go to the rack

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,620
Wireless website which is the vendor for

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,770
this

00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,080
they do sell get rid also so you can

00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:50,690
just buy in club or something

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,130
you can't configure the the western

00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,969
borders okay well you need a specific

00:34:52,130 --> 00:35:00,369
yeah let's just say node okay

00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,369
[Music]

00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:19,059
okay any more questions or should I just

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:21,160
stop the stream screen chat yeah you

00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:23,819
just have the screen share and I'll turn

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,819
