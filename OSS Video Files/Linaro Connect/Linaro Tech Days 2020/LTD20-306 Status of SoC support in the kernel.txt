Publication date: 2020-04-01
Playlist: Linaro Tech Days 2020
Description: 
	Description: 
As the kernel keeps changing over the years, it's time to take a fresh look at what SoC support is present in the kernel for ARM and other architectures.

Interesting trends are how arm64 is slowly taking over from arm32, how both have taken over from almost all the other architectures over the years, and how new architectures are coming along.
