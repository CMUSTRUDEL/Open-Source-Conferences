however Lily my name is Randall thank

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,930
you for joining us and hope everybody's

00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:15,719
doing her best as possible taking into

00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:17,070
account world situation I will cover the

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,100
work that we have been doing within the

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:24,270
ninety six boards team on Ottawa and

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:28,530
related topics over the last year why

00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,930
doesn't it okay yeah so little bit about

00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,309
myself so my name is cervando jamon

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,399
serrano I'm a software application

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,079
engineer between de niro my background

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,089
in some different autonomous systems

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:50,339
ranging from carbs but copters

00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:54,449
submarines etc okay so that one year ago

00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:56,399
in Bangkok connect myself and feel oh

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,829
great we've had a couple of sessions

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,199
which are available online on their

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,489
resources from the neural connect

00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,670
basically we cover a bit of an

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,510
introduction to other word and

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,060
improvements that we were working on

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,880
within the auto we're up to three so

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,820
just as a little bit of recap what we

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,300
covered in our introduction session we

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,010
gave a little bit of a background of

00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,590
auto world of the eye which we can see

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,720
an image on the left hand side and we

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,390
gave polyrhythm of the world of auto

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,470
which was pretty much since it in its

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,210
infancy and it has is now growing we

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,380
speak with members of the community

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,750
working on it

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,320
the third project what so the where RL

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,360
was not started yet obviously but we

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,760
have quite an interaction today as well

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,370
only because that's gone forward for

00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,830
decisions covering those just go online

00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,450
to you know connect association you can

00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,040
see myself and Anthea just covering

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,710
everything anything they are like half

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,210
an hour each and then on the different

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,120
improvements that we were working on

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,300
from the neuroscience so we started at

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,179
in unit tests and using G test framework

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,649
to try to address some of the technical

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,560
that we can be of the world software

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,380
stack or the way I in this place so as

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,390
part of that we are me

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,930
my set of tests and that's only I said

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,330
ask him contributors to add tests to the

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:29,160
new PR that were being submitted part of

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:31,230
our half-hour job from that we set up

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,090
the initial energy on infrastructure

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,630
moving from Travis CI to do some

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,600
shortcomings of we had on on Ferguson

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,700
and in order to make sure the unit tests

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,380
were being run since there were notice

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,590
at the bomb at the start that was not an

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:50,070
issue but so far we have been improved

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,670
quite a lot and he loves he is running

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,970
also on the coral reef of move to to

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,250
give lab instead of likely to move back

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,410
to github in the in the future but we

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,590
had a bit of some robots with me get

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,900
lucky I basically was no automatic of

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,240
pipelines from there from the ER from

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,910
previous ports and as well only x86

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,400
runners which is being addressed now to

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,530
Amazon Web Services as well so we had

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,040
some credits and we had I'm 64 netic

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,740
builds as well we can get now but from

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,410
that we updated the ma documentation

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,560
which was based in videos to the start

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,590
and so we had a little bit of a down

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,300
gone deeper into making sure that all

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,430
the instructions can be can be followed

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,090
easily just read another documentation

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,430
and copy pasting

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,530
now moving on to the what's new so

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,770
taking a little bit on all the world

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:50,730
Ohio and with 96 most of the month it

00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:53,070
will be a part of but over at i/o Rose

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,630
is an interface project 402 word since

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,790
although we're a I another word although

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,040
we're focusing on the software stack of

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,530
the word is that kind of bucket with her

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,070
old opinion so proprietary sense or

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,880
drivers or proprietary code that some

00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,740
companies would like to share an

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,090
interview with without the word travel

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,709
for the sensors computing you needs all

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,900
the different hardware reference

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,180
platforms that we want to build and want

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,130
to that are gonna be part of the other

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,980
word foundation in the community we can

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,620
tools interface and test frameworks and

00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,180
as well as I said it would allow any

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,830
company to integrate with in other world

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,810
let's say a company and they are

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,080
developing

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,280
closed localization software a piece of

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,700
software and they don't want to release

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,730
their first code but the Hinkle recently

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,560
with other where they could potentially

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,870
release binaries to be used by companies

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,970
will demo binaries we can do to where I

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:54,300
own part of the o2 Vireo now we have the

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,970
auto core PC use auto correlation to six

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,280
boards and they have released these

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:03,030
percentage of repeating units not long

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,190
ago naturally as I put there the link

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,570
that rose this course announcement so

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,880
they made a public announcement on their

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,990
on the PC you and if you flew a lane you

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,600
can actually have a look at the

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,340
different hardware that is built on it

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,740
and what they are using on as well all

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,290
they're offering on software that comes

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,880
across with with the pchew pchew is the

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,850
part of the records that we designed for

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,760
october and asahi news platform it's

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,850
NASA and see you and npuap picture with

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,190
the MPU from an XP one of the nice

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,860
things about these is that actually you

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,110
can plug in hardware accelerators I had

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,700
the PCIe such as there in Google karate

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,520
PU which was presented earlier to

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,380
available and to be order to be able to

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,050
run all the neural networks and that's

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,260
all things one of the things worth

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,330
mentioning as well comparing with other

00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,340
offerings from from other companies and

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,490
what people are using learning Dutch

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,990
Turkish vegan that sort of approach this

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:03,570
con suspense timekeeper condÃ© and other

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,940
alternatives as well as its Auto great

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,830
so you could potentially and that's the

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,540
target use these as a development

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,630
platform and as well push that into a

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,990
product afterwards but I'll try to work

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,730
around all that sort of issues now in

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,880
order to prepare for these what we have

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,170
been doing since the PCU is planning

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,450
part of the ninety six boards we have a

00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,160
range of associates and the different

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,110
board we have that we have available so

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,450
we have been doing some groundwork in

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,660
preparation for the PC you another hard

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,730
weather will come in the future so as we

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,230
can see here with some of them and this

00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,230
is work that we have available and we

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,599
have started to work on Heike 970 from

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:46,629
high silicon rb3 keys from from work

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,909
Luther 96 from stylings and a IML / from

00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:51,250
from from our robe

00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:53,889
now the next of the work that I will

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,729
show has been sponsored by by tier 4

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,099
which is there

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,949
we're actually Auto beret is started

00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:02,500
from has been focused mainly in

00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,270
future-proofing they work on on auto

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,210
wear and a different deployment that we

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,699
can achieve from the multiple associates

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:13,449
we have done couple of things starting

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:15,069
with real-time Andros to enable meant so

00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:17,909
for this to start with

00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,319
and did you constrain it on time and and

00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:24,310
and therefore we haven't started on the

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:27,879
Heike 970 on the dragon board 8:45 so

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,650
with the rb3 kit and the purpose of this

00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,669
work which has been replicated about on

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:36,580
both boards have been enabling enabling

00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:39,520
real-time Carmen and after exploring

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,199
different avenues for real-time which

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,810
landed on the brilliant our team

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,909
patching which seemed to be the easiest

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,029
way forward although is not hard

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:51,430
real-time we can start developing soft

00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:53,740
real-time applications using it in order

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,199
to do so for example for the hiking and

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,870
70 and worth saying that all these work

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,750
is public and it's available as part of

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:05,710
the real-time and Rose to blog series

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,599
within the 96 board's website we started

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,940
preparing the ball and you see the value

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,620
neck builder tool to add to get into a

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:17,580
team with Colonel or pine for 978

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,409
following that and using monies

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,960
instructions on enabling different

00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:25,089
kernel for hiking and 70 we have paid in

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,610
the bootloader and actually as well not

00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:30,699
really the command to or point 1478 in

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,099
order to match the payment activity so

00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:36,699
after cross compiling the kernel we just

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:39,880
build it and we in order to check that

00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:43,089
the real-time kernel was enabled we went

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,510
on and installed Rose to install rose to

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,640
dashi

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,440
where Harvey autumn is not a raid over

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,360
there is some initial support and we

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,079
started working looking at the pendulum

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,670
inverted pendulum demo one of the works

00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:57,110
that we had to work out of the start

00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:00,200
with the pendulum over that by

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,760
we need a gigabytes of RAM and if you

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,990
guys are familiar with the Heike 970

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,050
there are only six feet away from

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,330
available so we have to go deep into the

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,200
code and figure out a way on how to

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,990
reduce that but after doing that we

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,940
could install by default prostitute

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,340
comes with first 30 period videos but we

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,680
also installed cyclone VBS and we

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:26,030
managed to run the pendulum demo with

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,500
the results so for the demo we had one

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,870
kid heard something loop and I'm

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,060
actually the relevance of 30,000

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,300
nanoseconds so we can see in both

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,970
pictures the dark dotted line is the

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,770
maximum eater allowed and we can see

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,160
that both DDS implementation we have a

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:46,130
couple of runs and we haven't had the

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,260
time to identify why we you can see that

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,270
both DDS implementations comply with the

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,330
requirement for the testing apart from

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,860
the starting point which we have assumed

00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,320
that is used in memory recognition

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,230
memory location there's a lot of tests

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,930
but both of them for the maximum either

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:07,280
they both stay well below the maximum

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:09,890
allowed so once we complete this effort

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,440
we decided to go ahead and duplicate the

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,210
same on the dragon body for taxi in

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,700
order to prepare this board what we did

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,290
is we flow the replace the default in

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,090
order they were very ambassador user

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,090
just following the ethics is poor

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,800
documentation are not really the kernel

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,260
using lean are pertinent in tandem so

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,500
easily we downloaded five-point you from

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:34,340
from welcome landing team three butts

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,040
the premium particle now on plastic one

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,150
of the hurdles that we have to

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,490
investigate with this board because the

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:44,390
Ambassador is not supported by rust true

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,280
since they support one to 18 so what

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,680
what we decided to do was actually

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,780
installed okay so we installed a pair on

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,090
the on the dragon board and I started

00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,670
and put together a couple of DVDs to use

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:59,120
on the 96 board took at Harbor

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:01,370
Laboratory some of them yes the default

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,280
images that come with Ross from row so

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,560
we miss another valley narrow user and

00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,090
they know know that we also precompiled

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,550
other where of the weary eye or the

00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,980
world auto natto and roast

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,350
which I will cover later to be used for

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,050
the demos as well so these images are a

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,240
native over on 64th so you can use these

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:24,769
with these boards or any are 64 volts

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,250
you might want to use so following that

00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:31,310
what we just pull the rose dashing image

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,110
and then the same issue we had before so

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,000
for their pendulum mo we needed a

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,700
gigabytes of RAM but there are only four

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,529
available on the on the rv3 key so what

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,560
we did we just modify the code on the

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:46,190
pendulum demo to limit the amount of RAM

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,470
require other words we spread a little

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,029
bit of time looking into setting up in

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,370
we're looking for conditions and

00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:54,980
permissions for the docker container but

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:58,310
following on those steps we can see here

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,160
that we had sort of the same result that

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,110
we had with the Heike 970 both DDS

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,350
implementations partners VPS and cyclone

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,060
VBS stay well below the maximum heater

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,070
or the

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,410
inverted pendulum memo which means that

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:17,649
we can start developing Soviet time

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:20,270
applications on both ports and for us to

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:23,690
afterwards the next piece of wars and

00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:25,839
which started as a new blog series which

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,270
we called Ottawa everywhere

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,180
but subtly today main effort to prepare

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,550
for different nests of C's Sparta photo

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,610
world radio so what we try to do is

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,829
deploy autoworkers components of other

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,770
work into different NTC's boards as you

00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:44,839
see we have a couple of options either

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,600
from source mode occur depending on the

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,510
board we both and we cover both in the

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,510
in the blog post and then with another

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,339
word for wrote over the design we took a

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,410
subset of components due to the fair

00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,980
worker strain so if you had multiple

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,730
words you could run all auto where apart

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,140
from the neural networks at the moment

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,690
which you could do in the in the PC you

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,680
instead and for other words of auto they

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,160
stated awasa

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,800
when we did the blog posts but when you

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,510
so there was quite a little bit only

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,240
available so if you go now and try to

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,680
replicate you would have a lot more

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,930
functionalities and usability in the

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,510
other world of the auto repository

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,760
and then what we also cover is bridging

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:33,770
both software stacks so let's say you

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:38,180
want a better software from motootto but

00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:40,040
Eliza with some functionality we cannot

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,140
about that either we would like to use

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,140
so we also showed us well how to bleach

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,420
both the stacks together to make the

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,790
best of both worlds

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:54,110
so for East railway to cover what we did

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:57,800
within AutoCAD LT I so we run the

00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:01,270
Rosberg demo but just as a subset of the

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,529
tasks within the demo so also

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:06,860
investigating how to run it headless so

00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:09,200
instead of using the GUI that is

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,089
available within other word we put

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,709
together the way of actually doing it

00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,020
manually and the astronaut from

00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:17,450
terminals and you do memory constraints

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,529
for example Heike 970 we couldn't just

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:23,570
run the map instance in on localization

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,890
so we can see here a little bit of what

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,700
we can see so we use the different

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,880
laptop for the visualization bit and

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:34,670
that's just running the Rose bag

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,529
launching different launch files within

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,660
it and we can see it be here for the

00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:41,209
localization the what we expected on the

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,970
right hand side terminal was they ended

00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:47,660
in matching to say okay which was a

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,760
success then for auto world of auto what

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,260
we did is actually build as well it's

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,980
very if you don't want to build it from

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:57,350
source so you can just pull the auto dot

00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,690
auto compilation in docker image that we

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:03,170
put together for for the port 96 ports

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,690
that's available on a docker hub and

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,880
what we did is just we redid the 3d

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,690
position start demo that is available as

00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,279
part of the auto documentation and we

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,560
just adapted the steps for the headless

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,260
run but also we use the super data for

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,360
the for the visualization and we

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,880
connected the board on the laptop via

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,459
ethernet to avoid any delay if you want

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,450
to when I buy a Wi-Fi because out of

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:31,190
that I'm moving around so we can see

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,279
here what we did so that's running on

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:37,230
the high command 74 their 3d position

00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:40,960
start demo which is actually replaying

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:43,260
Bella buying pickup file with a with a

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,190
point cloud naturally doing some

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,260
reduction on the data points on the

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:51,460
right hand side on the bottom for the

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:54,190
box and vids and then finally as we said

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,730
what we try to cover with bridge in both

00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,410
software stacks together so we use the

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,480
Ross one bridge to connect which

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,490
connects rows 1 and rows 2 and see it is

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,500
all there is built using Ross one

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,350
another word about or field using cross

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,830
2 so we use these bits to link both of

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,589
stacks together in order to actually

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:17,080
showcase the scenario what we did is we

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:19,779
use the velobind driver from the total

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,390
which is the same one that we used here

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:24,760
on the on the on the demo but use the

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,150
unbeaten mapping capabilities to build a

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:33,580
map using the pickup parallel from from

00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:36,070
below line so this is the output and if

00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,010
you try this is likely you will run out

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,880
of memory so it takes a lot of

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,640
computational capability to actually

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,700
build a map you can only showcase the

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,320
how things worked and this is a dot map

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,620
on the on the right is actually built

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:54,490
using the Heike 970 so you might not be

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:57,190
able to run the food rose pica fire two

00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,440
and build a full map but there is a the

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,800
meetin pieces on how to put things

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,050
together and how to start doing things

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,730
on both things and that's it think it

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,650
might be quite early so thank you all

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:13,439
for listening there any questions

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:17,650
these shoes yes that was very efficient

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:21,390
cylinder we do have some questions so

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:25,630
first question havoc paired

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:29,950
sin on may versus RT preempts for

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:33,370
real-time so cinema was one of the

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:36,040
things that we tried but in naturally

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,530
using instead of RT pre end but I'm

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,679
running into a lot of trouble trying to

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:47,380
get it working on the arm 64 hardware

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:50,590
and so we opted for artillery and rather

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,390
than that's analyzer we had colonel

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:58,360
other things I wasn't able to actually

00:17:52,390 --> 00:18:01,360
run cinema under on the example okay

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,610
and then the next question is did you

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:10,929
see difference in our tea performance

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:13,570
between 4.14 and 55.2 so for 449 faculty

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:15,640
we actually didn't compare both so the

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:20,460
main issue of using two different ones

00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:23,409
is because the Heike 970 was built on

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,779
4.9 so we have really two foreign

00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:28,539
foreign team and then for the dragon

00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,070
board take 45 wheels 5.2 as a bag

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:33,159
because that's what comes from the

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,809
