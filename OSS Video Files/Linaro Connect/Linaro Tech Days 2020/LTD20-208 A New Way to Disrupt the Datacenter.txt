Publication date: 2020-04-01
Playlist: Linaro Tech Days 2020
Description: 
	Description: 

The datacenter space is ripe for disruption, but it is a challenging space to enter. We believe in the power of Open Source and collaboration as key enablers. In this session, we will introduce ourselves and how we plan to do things differently at NUVIA.

	00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,640
so firstly it's an interesting format

00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:10,900
I'd like to thank lawn ro for putting

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,190
together the Patek days so it would have

00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,900
been great to see all of you in person

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,119
but you know sometimes we have to

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,449
overcome adversity and again this is

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,420
this is great I was hoping that if in

00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:30,010
Budapest to just kind of reintroduce

00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:32,590
myself in my new role at new via and and

00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,380
kind of walk a lot of you through

00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,090
through this in person in terms of our

00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,340
approach and how we think we're going to

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,660
do things differently so today we'll

00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,610
fill in a little bit for that and

00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,399
hopefully we'll all get to see each

00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,250
other pretty soon and continue these

00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,550
conversations so my name is John masters

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,270
I used to be at Red Hat for a very long

00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:58,899
time for about the last fourteen years

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:03,629
and in the fall of last year I left Red

00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:08,079
Hat and joined a startup called new Thea

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:11,139
and what we're trying to do is enter the

00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,520
arm server space and do things just a

00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:14,079
little bit differently so this

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,599
presentation will talk a little bit

00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,679
about what it is that we're doing as a

00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:23,259
company what it is that you're gonna see

00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:25,599
from us over the next few years and then

00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:28,359
what our approach is going to be I do

00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,520
have the chat up here on a separate

00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,709
screen so if you have questions you can

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,990
type them and then we'll take questions

00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:37,389
at the end but we'll also if they're

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,469
really pertinent wills will stop and

00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:45,130
answer them as we go okay I'm trying to

00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:47,139
go to the next slide okay so this is not

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,310
to marketing II I did get a couple of

00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:53,859
these slides from our head of marketing

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,989
but so just give me a couple of these to

00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:58,020
give you the kind of background so we

00:01:55,989 --> 00:02:00,309
talked about how there's a perfect storm

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,349
brewing in the industry right there's an

00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:04,559
increasing amounts of data being

00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:08,110
processed particularly in the cloud

00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:11,219
there so there's a there's a growing and

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,460
kind of insatiable appetite for you know

00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:17,620
compelling data center server offerings

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,360
we've seen a lot of interest over the

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,600
past few years particularly in the

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,540
emerging arm server space and we see

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,240
tremendous opportunity in the years

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,920
ahead

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,350
born out by the growth that's happening

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,200
in the data center space and what I mean

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:42,340
by perfect storm is that you're seeing

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,820
you're seeing simultaneously a growth in

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:49,300
performance in the mobile space right so

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,989
it used to be that when you got when you

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,330
looked at the advances in the the

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,480
industry what would happen is that one

00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,550
of the big incumbents whose name I don't

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,480
need to mention every year would give

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,670
you you know a new and faster processor

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,100
right and you saw a lot of innovation

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,280
happening being led by you know one or

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,160
two big incumbents in the traditional PC

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,780
space over the last few decades and then

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,630
over the last ten years what you've seen

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,090
is a rise in performance leadership

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,850
that's been happening in the mobile

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,910
space and that's informed by you know

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,769
many other changes so for example you

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,780
know the slide says Moore's law has has

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:37,299
slowed and is slowing I go as far myself

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,890
as to say Moore's law is dead others

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,260
have different opinions but no matter

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,209
how you look at it it's no longer the

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,070
case that you kind of get these cheap

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,049
and easy performance wins every year

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,840
right you actually have to innovate

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:56,049
beyond just better manufacturing to get

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,250
improvements over time it's getting

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:01,420
worse not better

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,459
so you know we've seen talk from some of

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,739
the vendors about you know going from

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,140
you know one process node to another

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:10,330
that they would achieve this over the

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:14,049
years and then we've seen delay after

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,209
delay after delay but even beyond that

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:20,440
what you're seeing is just that the cost

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,600
of going to leading manufacturing

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,690
technologies is increasing over time as

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,510
well right so increasingly that is not

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,700
the escape valve that gets you

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,280
from one generation to the next you need

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,890
to innovate beyond that there have been

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,360
execution problems and then you know

00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:41,220
we've been stuck with a lot of legacy

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,460
stuff and those of us who believed in

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,410
the emerging opportunity for new

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,210
architectures right the reason that we

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,680
always thought that there were these

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,630
opportunities who is that we were

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,180
looking at this landscape ten years ago

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,770
we were saying wow what if we could take

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,420
all of the things we've learned in

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,520
mobile and in these other segments and

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,850
apply them to server and so of course

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,860
you know groups like the llanera

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,050
Enterprise Group and now the datacenter

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,170
group and I believe it's being renamed

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,030
to datacenter and cloud but the efforts

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:20,290
inside Lonardo have been an example of

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:22,660
this where manaro engaged early to go

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,270
and help define some of the standards

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,400
and some of the foundational pieces that

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,610
we are now going to leverage and I'll

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,640
talk a bit more about that in a moment

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:38,350
so as I said you've basically had a past

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,040
where you've had manufacturing that's

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,820
improved

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,650
year on year or every other year you've

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,450
had a certain amount of architectural

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,010
innovation so what I mean by

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,580
architectural innovation is the actual

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,970
design of these processors has improved

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,270
over time but there really was a golden

00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,600
age where we were getting you know 52

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,430
percent year-on-year performance

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,120
advances and over the last few years

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,950
that's really leveled off and what we

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
think is that there's a huge opportunity

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,600
if somebody would have come in with a

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,600
completely new way of doing the

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,430
architecture side of things and also to

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,580
embrace some of the changes happening in

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,170
terms of heterogeneous computing with

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,060
accelerators and so on if you were to

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:28,660
really come in with the fresh

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,610
perspective in terms of fresh

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:35,710
architecture you actually could could do

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:39,700
a lot and this is borne out if you look

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:42,249
if you look at the kind of the data for

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,879
the past few years so this graph shows

00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:49,509
whose relative performance over the past

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:54,819
five years between you know the

00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:59,379
industry-leading x86 processor and the

00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:01,859
industry-leading arm SOC so this is not

00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:05,679
actually an arm server SOC this is

00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:08,349
actually a mobile design and what you're

00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:10,089
seeing is arm is catching up and in fact

00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:12,999
if you were to extrapolate this graph

00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:15,669
and play it out over time you would see

00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,649
that there's a lot of potential there

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:22,779
for forearm that's just starting to be

00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:27,579
realized if you add in you know the

00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:29,079
other SOC in the market so far now

00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:32,019
there's a lot of great stuff happening

00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,879
and I'm not trying to diminish anything

00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,039
that's happened so far I think there's

00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,409
some some great players in the arm space

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:42,279
so far but if you look at the

00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:46,059
opportunity if you were to take a fresh

00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:48,819
approach there's tremendous room there

00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:52,299
to take some of these learnings from the

00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:53,860
mobile space and apply them differently

00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:58,649
and get that kind of performance

00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:01,689
leadership and really take x86 head-on

00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:04,749
so that's what we're trying to do at new

00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,979
VA and I'll walk through now kind of how

00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:10,179
we're doing that and what it is that

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:12,939
we're doing so a little bit about new vo

00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:16,239
first as a company so we announced in

00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:18,819
November that we exist we announced our

00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:24,039
Series A funding of fifty three million

00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:26,409
dollars and we have a leadership team

00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,619
that's in pop formed by the three

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:32,889
founders that you see here so John Bruno

00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:35,289
Gerrard Williams and Manoj gelati they

00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:38,110
are industry veterans that have worked

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:44,259
for you know major companies including

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:47,769
Apple AMD and Google amongst many others

00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:51,309
over the years now sherrod who the

00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:55,110
person in the middle who's my boss led

00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:56,190
to the design of every single one of the

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,850
industry

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:03,390
leading Apple processors that you've

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,430
seen over the past 10 years and the

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,350
other founders are just as talented and

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,260
capable so it's an interesting

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,710
collection of people when you extend

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,420
this out to the kinds of talent and I'm

00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,130
trying to exclude myself here but when

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,440
you look at the the kinds of people that

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,690
they've pulled into the company it's

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,090
very interesting for such an early stage

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,850
so we are now more than a hundred and

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:30,270
twenty people having just announced in

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,490
November I was employee number 50 in

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:36,900
November we're now at 120 plus people

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:41,940
and you know we continue to grow these

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,950
are the kinds of companies that people

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,340
have come from who are in the veer so

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:50,880
it's a kind of very broad landscape of

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:53,070
different players are not exclusive to

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,470
not exclusively embedded by background a

00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:59,010
lot of us have extensive experience in

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,600
the data center and the server space and

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,540
you know we're just bringing everything

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,200
that we've learned from the past into

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,640
what we're trying to do a new view so

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,800
what is our what is our vision what are

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,970
we actually trying to do right so what

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,600
we want to do is we want to create the

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:21,480
world's best server processor period

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,840
right so our goal is to win on every

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:28,260
metric right performance energy

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,510
efficiency and TCO right so when when we

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,960
say that we want to lead in these

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:37,410
metrics it's not you know relative to a

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,660
mobile part or relative to you know all

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,600
of the other ARM processors for example

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,030
the goal is to win across the industry

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,110
against anything else that's in market

00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,580
today I'll talk a bit more about exactly

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,970
how we're how we're going to achieve

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,710
that one of one of the ways that one of

00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:00,839
the philosophies that we're bringing to

00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:02,430
this is is is really embracing hardware

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,730
and software teams working closely

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,320
together so you know in a kind of

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,640
traditional environment and we've all

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,140
seen these you have kind of

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,650
hardware team sitting off to one side

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,240
and you have your software organization

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,010
and they sort of fight each other right

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,670
and they say all those Hardware people

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,990
all those software people and you end up

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,800
with a lot of this kind of needless

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:28,060
friction between organizations so what

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,310
we're trying to do is we're trying to

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,040
embrace just having everybody you know

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:36,250
collaborate as openly as possible

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,960
together and so I came up with this line

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,480
here the only barriers we supported

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,490
those defined by the architecture and I

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,650
intend to live that so you know it's

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,360
it's the only thing that's banned inside

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,760
the company is referring to people as

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,590
all those Hardware people or those

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,870
software people right we're all just

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,820
trying to do the same thing together and

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,220
that means if you're working on software

00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,800
you have the ability to go and you know

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,540
look at the design and understand why

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,430
something's behaving a certain way and

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,800
if you are working on hardware you have

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,480
the ability to come talk to people that

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,240
are working on software and understand

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,240
you know what their needs are and we're

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,400
trying to inform one another rather than

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,650
have a kind of adversarial relationship

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,760
that that we have seen sometimes in the

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:24,990
past what you'll see from us so you'll

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,670
see meaningful single thread performance

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:30,010
leadership right so what we're planning

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,360
to do is we're planning to bring a

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,390
product to market and the

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,030
not-too-distant future that will be

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,070
disruptively better in terms of single

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:43,360
thread performance so the disruptive

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:47,020
doesn't mean 5% better or 10% better or

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,260
you know 20% better than everything else

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:53,410
that you could get today or by the time

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,600
we're in market disruptive means a lot

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,590
better in terms of single thread right

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,540
not multi-core single thread performance

00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:04,360
one of our ground rules is that we

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,720
cannot do this using a magic compiler or

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:11,320
by changing software so we run the

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,350
software that's already there you know

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,560
whether it's good bad other you know we

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:22,870
will come in with opinions on how it is

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,590
that we like software to change you know

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,690
we will

00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,150
we will be data-driven so we will say

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:31,720
for example hey it'd be really great if

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:34,750
we had this interface or mechanism that

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,880
we could use to improve performance but

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,770
whenever we do that we'll try to do it

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,750
based on data and we'll try to do it

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,630
based on collaboration and using and

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,030
embracing industry standards to do it so

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,910
we're not we're not excluding the idea

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,520
of getting performance benefit by making

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,340
changes to software but that is not what

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,760
we need to do in order to realize our

00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:00,700
goals and we plan also to have genuine

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,670
engagement right so when I say that we

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,200
want to work with communities and

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,740
ecosystems such as everyone here today I

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,540
really mean that

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,430
right I spent 14 years of my life in Red

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,260
Hat living and breathing open source

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,300
I still live and breathe open source I

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,700
still truly embrace all of those

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,950
philosophies I truly believe in the

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,120
value of Lennar oh and the value of

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,780
doing things the right way

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,660
which isn't always the easy way and when

00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:35,580
I say we want to work with everyone here

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,580
I really really actually do mean that

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,990
what else you'll see so I don't if Mark

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,850
Hamilton is here today but in honor of

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:48,070
Mark Hamilton we have the Unicorn slide

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,730
so but unicorns are real in this case

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:55,630
right so what you will get from us is an

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:57,640
embracement of industry standards right

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:01,180
so everyone knows me as someone who's a

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:04,300
standards fan this design that we're

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,610
building is fully SPSA SBB our server

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,580
ready it complies with all of the arm

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,770
standards it is in that sense one of the

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,870
most fabulously boring things you've

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:18,880
seen in your life right that is my goal

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:23,110
other goals that we have are to be fully

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:26,830
upstream in Linux on day one actually

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:28,960
day zero right ahead of time so when we

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,510
are in market you will be able to run an

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,230
an unmodified upstream Linux kernel

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:37,329
right no hacks no Kluge's you know no

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,059
nonsense right No

00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:42,100
you know here's our wacky random patch

00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:44,410
that you need now we know that we could

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,899
have you know errata we could have

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,369
issues people do okay and we'll deal

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:53,439
with that but we'll deal with that again

00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:54,970
in a upstream focused manner right if we

00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:57,249
need to come back and need to ask for

00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,339
something we will engage and we will do

00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:02,379
it the right way our goal is to support

00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,769
all standards based operating systems

00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:07,749
out of the box so you get you get a very

00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:10,209
boring server from us that just works

00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:12,540
you turn it on you put the operating

00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:15,279
system of your choice on that machine

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:19,079
and you have a fabulous non experience

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,079
right that's what we're planning to do

00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:23,290
beyond that what you'll see is

00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:27,429
meaningful upstream engagement from us

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:30,339
so we are in the process of building our

00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:31,809
hardware and software teams I own the

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,799
software organization and what I'm

00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:38,829
trying to do is hire people that are

00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:41,110
very focused on upstream and understand

00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:45,369
the benefit and the value of upstream so

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:48,069
as an example you know I can hire 10

00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:49,929
people that go and build custom versions

00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:52,569
of all kinds of stuff and then I have to

00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:54,910
go and support all of that right or I

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:56,769
can hire you know ten people that go and

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,989
work on doing this the right way

00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:01,029
upstream and engaging with the

00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:03,519
downstream you know operating system

00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,100
vendors and communities and so on I'm

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,029
gonna get more return on investment if I

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,350
do it the way that goes through upstream

00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:13,929
then I am if I go and try to do

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:18,519
something special so you won't see

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:20,500
something special from us we will remove

00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:24,699
barriers to collaboration so you will

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,529
see us engaging in discussions you will

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,470
see documentation actually useful

00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:31,600
documentation from us you will be able

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,029
to come back to us and call us out when

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,429
we don't do that right so we're not we

00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:40,029
we aren't gonna try to live up to these

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:41,830
goals and if you find that hey those

00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:43,450
folks over there are building something

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,669
and I don't know how that works or

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,850
what's going on here and I can't support

00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:50,659
that we actually plan to engage take

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,519
that feedback and go and make

00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:55,940
infull changes whenever people see

00:17:52,519 --> 00:18:00,229
things that are needlessly impeding

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:04,159
progress other things that you'll get

00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:07,369
from us right so you'll get a fully open

00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,399
source firmware stack right so when you

00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:13,129
get one of our systems you will be able

00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:16,749
to rebuild everything that's running on

00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:19,669
that from the reset vector on right so

00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:22,519
yes we're using arm trusted firmware yes

00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:25,570
we're using Tianna core yes we're a CPI

00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:29,090
based and so on but if you have a

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,999
platform and you want to go and rebuild

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:34,279
all of these components you actually

00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:36,739
won't you will get a reference from us

00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,629
right so in the same way that Lonardo

00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:40,609
has built its reference stacks in the

00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:44,269
past you will get reference software

00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:46,609
from us but what you won't get is you

00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:48,679
know you have to run this blob you can't

00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:50,899
change anything what you instead will

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,639
get from us is here is the reference

00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:55,639
build that we did so you can turn your

00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:59,149
machine on and we built it using this

00:18:55,639 --> 00:19:01,820
get hash from this upstream repository

00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:03,619
on this date and if you want to go and

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,210
rebuild it you have all of the pieces to

00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:07,580
go and do that from yourself for

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,799
yourself right or make changes or

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:13,279
improve it and we will collaborate and

00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,830
engage there in fact that will be our

00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,529
default mode of operation right so if

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,690
you want to go and iterate with us you

00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:26,239
will be able to do that using the

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:29,809
upstream focused points and yes we do

00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:32,019
have a plan to get hardware available

00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,669
for developers right I'm not in a

00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:37,279
position today to share the details on

00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:40,609
that but we do understand the need for

00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,259
the affordable developer platforms we do

00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:44,659
understand that that's something that is

00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:47,419
very important and we will also work

00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:49,489
with all of the usual kind of suspects

00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,979
there so yes we'll engage with people

00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:54,379
like packet and others over time to make

00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:58,669
sure that you have access to to hardware

00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:59,960
as well so I'm going to summarize

00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:02,629
because I want to give time for some

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,220
questions so we are going to build a

00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:07,850
full custom stay

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,890
it's based arm server SOC right it's a

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,860
full it's a full custom core full

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:15,409
customer so see it's fully armed is a

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,929
compliant it's fully compliant with SPS

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:19,520
a and SBB are it will pass server ready

00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:21,380
it will have all of the standard

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,240
stickers and logos and it will be the

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,650
most fabulously boring standards

00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,450
compliant server that you've ever seen

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:31,940
while simultaneously leading in terms of

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,740
performance across the industry and also

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,130
being incredibly easy for data centers

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,400
to adopt we plan to build reference

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:42,320
platforms that exercise these designs

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,750
and then we plan to engage aggressively

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,990
with our early customers and we have you

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:51,770
know big you know customers already in

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:54,169
place the kinds of cloud companies and

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,580
so on that you could imagine and so

00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:59,059
you'll be hearing more from us about

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,679
that over time but um but but you can

00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,840
expect to get some very interesting

00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:05,539
stuff I like I hope over the next few

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,520
years I'd like to leave a couple minutes

00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:11,530
open for questions if anybody has them

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:14,270
I'm seeing some on the chat so let's see

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:19,789
are you targeting server desktop or

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:23,690
laptop so the design we have if we were

00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:26,630
to take our design and put it into any

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,880
of those spaces it would lead in terms

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:36,100
of performance and energy efficiency

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:39,080
today no holds barred but we are not

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,419
choosing at this point to enter the

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,159
desktop or laptop space so that while

00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:48,710
you will likely see you know developers

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,730
type systems more on the workstation

00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:55,280
side from us we don't have any plans to

00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,100
share today as far as you know desktop

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,720
or laptop or clamshell type systems

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,700
I saw Marcin was asking that question

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,700
but you know if you want to replace your

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,730
existing you know workstation with

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,340
something a bit more standard yes there

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:14,480
will be an option there it will have

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:16,940
more more cores it will support more

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,050
memory and it will have a lot of very

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,630
standard IO

00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:23,750
two phases so we believe a lot more in

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:26,900
you know a high-performance PCI and

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,820
memory than we do in you know lots of

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,360
custom widgets and so on as well so

00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:35,320
again this will be a very very standard

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,880
server can you give any insights into

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:42,620
the architecture changes to improve

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:46,850
single thread performance from mark

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:51,010
that's challenging uh what I can say is

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:54,440
that this is the biggest and most

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:58,190
complex design I've ever seen

00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,770
I've seen dozens of different server

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,070
designs over the years

00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:06,620
Giraud builds things very differently

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:08,870
he's got a he's very well known in the

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:14,140
industry for building industry-leading

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:17,630
machines he describes them in terms of

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:20,680
beautiful ideas like ocean waves moving

00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:22,670
through machines and so on

00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,560
we'll go into a bit more detail

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,630
obviously about the architectural

00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,950
changes but this will not look from a

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,480
microarchitecture point of view this

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,960
doesn't look like anything you've seen

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,560
before this is not a you know a

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,320
transmeta type machine this is a very in

00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,300
some sense traditional machine but in

00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,470
other senses it's it's very different

00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,550
than anything that is out there today

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:50,330
pipeline is very different things are

00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:53,680
very differently designed I look forward

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,680
to being to share more on that I guess

00:23:53,830 --> 00:24:02,600
question here are the extensions there's

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,220
a lot of arm v8 extensions are we

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,300
starting to look like a lot like the x86

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:11,090
feature creep yes I think that's true I

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:14,270
think I think that arm is is certainly

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,530
growing complexity over time we are of

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,200
course working with arm and the other

00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:19,190
partners to ensure that that doesn't get

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,320
too out of hand

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,360
I don't think it's too far out of hand

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,270
today I think we need to be very careful

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,980
I think there there there are benefits

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,020
every time we add some new feature but

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,670
there's also cost so we need to be very

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,650
careful

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,570
really carefully monitoring that over

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,220
time and then how do we compare to the

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:41,000
competition I'll make that my final

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:43,780
comment look you know I worked with you

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,250
know friends at ampere and and marvel

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,140
over the past few years I plan to

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,280
continue to work with everybody out

00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,630
there you know we're a start-up so we

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,320
probably won't be you know joining

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:59,420
Lennar Oh immediately but you know what

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,640
I will say is I'm not in the business of

00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,570
kind of attacking the other arm vendors

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,120
I really embrace the founding philosophy

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,940
of this of the data center group inside

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,390
Lonardo which was a bunch of pirates in

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:16,270
the bay attacking the Royal Navy right I

00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:20,030
think we all know who the Royal Navy is

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,950
and I think you know the Pirates

00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,920
attacking each other don't tend to

00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,200
benefit so what we'll do instead is

00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,350
we'll just engage with our industry

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,130
peers and partners and what we'll do is

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,870
we'll try to be a rising tide that that

00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,720
lifts all the boats together and that

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:41,180
will extend to the contributions that we

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,220
make as well you'll see upstream

00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,470
contributions from us that will benefit

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,920
everybody else and that's exactly how it

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:52,640
should be so we look forward to working

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:55,250
with everybody I look forward to seeing

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,440
all of you next time we have connect and

00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:00,290
if you have any more questions you can

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,520
reach me using all the usual social

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:08,810
media at John masters on Twitter or JCM

00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,550
at new via inc.com and with that I'd

00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,850
like to say thank you for inviting me
