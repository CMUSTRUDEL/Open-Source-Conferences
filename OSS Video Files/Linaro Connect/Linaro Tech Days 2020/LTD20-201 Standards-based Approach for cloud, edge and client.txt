hi everybody this is done way I have my

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,860
colleague purse a scholar with me we

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,190
have been doing as you many of you may

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,890
know the server ready program for quite

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,670
a few years and in today's talk we're

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,880
going to talk about how we extend a

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,109
standard based system architecture

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,830
beyond the servers

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:33,450
into the edge and client spaces so like

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,469
I mentioned we have been doing the

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:42,290
server standards for now or 10 years now

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:49,350
and we launched the civil ready program

00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:52,079
in 2018 and it it consists of a number

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,469
of specifications the first one is the

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,289
server base system architecture this is

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,170
the hardware requirements for generic of

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,850
the shelf oasis and it was basically

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,020
developed for the server systems

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,860
initially and it talks about the

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:14,369
architecture and system architecture and

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:17,369
basically it consists of the references

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:23,100
to the ARM architecture you know the ARM

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:26,009
version a dot X a class systems as well

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,270
as the industry standards things like

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,340
the PCI PCI Express technology and we

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,250
merge the two together so that we can

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,460
build server systems with the arm CPUs

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:43,890
the arm interconnects plus the industry

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,990
standard PCIe technologies and in the

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,470
future we are looking at the

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,799
technologies such as C Excel C 6 and

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,369
Jersey requirements related to those

00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,689
standards were coming as we integrate

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:03,090
these technologies into the systems on

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,040
the firmware side we have this thing

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,920
called the server base

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,129
boot requirements this is the minimum

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,030
firmware requirements for the OSS or

00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:15,640
hypervisors you know

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,569
targeted Windows Red Hat VMware but of

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,670
course you know SUSE I want to you know

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:25,060
many other operating systems are also

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,709
working fine on the servers and it was

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,190
addressing the horizontal integration

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:32,110
model where you know the OS vendors and

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,510
the device vendors are you know not

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,500
necessarily the same and so we need to

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:41,080
have standard form or interfaces to to

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,060
be agreed upon so that the OSS can just

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,519
work on these platforms so we again we

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,150
based the design on the ARM architecture

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:55,350
there are specifications we've got the

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,180
trusted firmware that PSC is MCC see

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,750
some of the bridges that we built for

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:05,920
supporting the industry standards like

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:09,010
UEFI CPI and sm bios we also support you

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,180
know the PCIe technologies as well as

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:17,680
you know the trusted compute TPM type of

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:21,930
measured boot so this is what we have

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,769
and like I mentioned we launched the

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:30,940
version 1.0 of serve already in 2018 and

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:34,900
we have been checking the specification

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:38,829
versions as to BSA version 3 bar 3.1 and

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,620
SP be a version 100 and we asked people

00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:44,290
to run the ACS testing which is a test

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,680
tool that we built and it is open source

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:50,829
and we also asked for two distros of

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,200
Linux installations to be done and

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:57,450
installation logs to be sent to us for

00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:02,260
evaluation and when PE was later made

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:05,440
public in 2019 so we are also

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,510
recommending people to use the wing PE

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,299
installation and give us the

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,940
installation log for evaluation as well

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,880
the value of when PE is that it is more

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:20,079
strict in terms of looking at things

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:23,680
that are a CPI and PCIe comp writes so

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,420
it may find more issues where the Linux

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:31,910
installations could

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:35,750
right and then we are planning to launch

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:38,480
the version 2.0 later this year and

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,790
originally it's planned for the Computex

00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,020
and yesterday I just got the notice that

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:48,770
the event is moving to September but we

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:51,520
we are still looking at a launch in June

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:56,210
so this might just be a virtual launch

00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:00,260
it's going to target SPSA version 5.0

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:03,760
and SBB our version 11.10 scenes are

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,170
available in are two years ago and and

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,460
you know we're checking against now the

00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:12,770
SPSA levels three to five and we're

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,540
going to release the ACS the test to

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:19,340
version 2.4 in the next week or so and

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,190
it allows you to check against these

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,610
newer levels and we're going to ask for

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:28,370
OS installation logs also but this time

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,730
we are going to ask for the wing PE as a

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,610
requirement and and then we in the

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,220
process of categorical categorizing the

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,880
oasis so that you can pick and choose

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:43,100
from some clusters rather than the

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,380
random selection because you know if you

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,260
just select Rio and fedora you're

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:54,770
probably just telling us you know kind

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:57,920
of a same same issues so so the reason

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,990
of asking for the wing windows PE and

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,380
distros of linux installation is that

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,350
you know this ACS 2 is what we developed

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,720
and we think you know it is in the

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,450
process of getting more mature right so

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,690
there may be some interfaces that we

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,660
didn't test sufficiently for the oasis

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,480
so we are checking with you know these

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,600
Linux and Windows installation to see

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,850
and improve on the ACS you know

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,850
hopefully eventually we just need people

00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:32,300
to test with ACS but I think you know as

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,880
we as Linux and Windows grow there may

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,270
be still some discrepancies that we need

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,569
to match so we're going to monitor this

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,210
situation as we

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:47,360
so the main topic for today is go beyond

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,520
the server's so the overall strategy

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,669
that we have is you know we have been

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,449
very successful for the SBS a and SSP BR

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:59,270
and target different you know - targeted

00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,490
service system right but but it is only

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,710
targeting a very specific slice of the

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,740
Aurora CO system you know literary the

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,930
data sense data center servers we would

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,310
like to take the concept and apply more

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,259
generically to other parts of the market

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,530
across the ecosystem and especially

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:21,349
defining a generic arm platform but we

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,530
don't want to change the server ready

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:25,849
because it's a well-known program and

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,400
people are you know who are using this

00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,780
program are well aware of it so we're

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,759
not going to change what civil ready is

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:40,099
on the hardware side we currently have

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:43,370
SBS a we think we can extract the from

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:46,159
it's the the baseline the BSA for the

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,919
generic hardware target and then we can

00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:53,830
build on top of it market segments

00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:58,509
feature sets so SPSA will continue to

00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:01,550
exist on top of BSA to specify the

00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:03,889
requirements that are specific for the

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,190
server market and then we are going to

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:10,940
introduce a CBSA which adds a roadmap

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,460
for the client features so CBSA is going

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,069
to build on top of BSA as well so I have

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:19,039
some diagrams to show in the next few

00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:21,560
slides and on the firmware side the

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,690
situation is a little different because

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,169
in this in the firmware side it's not so

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:30,379
much as you know market segment specific

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:33,620
it's really OS specific so we're going

00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:36,289
to expand and include some of the common

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,269
form or interfaces but at the same time

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,010
recognize that you know different

00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:45,410
software stacks may require different

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:47,690
recipes so on a BSA front we when we

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,390
started the SBS a we have two mangoes

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,910
one is to document a minimum set of CPU

00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,510
and system architecture for the OSS to

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,930
Putin

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,480
and the other one is to to show a

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,750
roadmap of levels that document an

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,980
increasing set of hardware features

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,280
following the progression of the CPU

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,530
architecture so we have literally

00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,400
combined these two girls together in the

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:16,490
original SPSA so you can see you know we

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,800
have progressed from you know level zero

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,960
all the way to six right now we're

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,400
working on level seven and so what we

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,860
recognize is that there are many devices

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,040
that want operating system to just work

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,200
but they are not necessarily all servers

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,120
so we're proposing to separate out to

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,730
the minimum hardware pieces from the

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,680
SPSA you know the first objective and

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:47,000
call that piece BSA this is pretty much

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:49,600
just the level 3 of the SPSA but with

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,700
some of the server specifics removed and

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,260
the BSA will become the minimum subset

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,720
of the hardware needed to boot and

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,550
running arise of course you need the

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,210
firmware piece I'm going to talk about

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:06,020
later and then the SPSA adds the market

00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:09,830
specific feature sets for the server

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,740
market and CBSA adds the client side

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:16,280
right so this will be done in a

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,200
completely compatible form so if you if

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,310
you are used to SPSA and you're

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,460
continuing to build you know SPSA

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,870
required systems compliant systems you

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,330
know you can continue to do that it's

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:33,260
going to be compatible and you just you

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:36,950
know use the BSA and SPSA together so

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:42,230
BSA we expect that will advance over

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:44,390
time but it may be under a you know

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:49,190
slower cadence because these kind of

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:52,160
features are probably more stable it

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,740
will advance over time but the cadence

00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:01,910
of which may be longer than the regular

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:04,190
SPSA and then the relationship with the

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:08,339
CBSA is that you know building on top of

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:12,459
BSA we we are going to

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:16,089
you know basically develop the clients

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:19,120
specific you know hardware requirements

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:23,800
so as the arm ecosystem moved towards

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:27,310
the laptops and you know phones and

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,550
tablets and maybe even desktops we would

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:34,060
be able to provide a standard platform

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:37,089
architecture so that the OSS can just

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,029
work as well so systems are becoming

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:42,490
complex enough that establishing a

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:46,019
common system architecture for the T

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:49,720
concepts are is going to be very useful

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,260
and so people may have the question of

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,149
you know

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,190
so what which spec do I use so the

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,980
vision is that many os's would treat the

00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,860
PSA as a target and then the server

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,870
ecosystem drives the levels in the SPSA

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,380
the client ecosystem drive the levels in

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:08,890
the CBSA and they may have different

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:12,339
requirements for different areas of

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:15,640
focus and at the end of the day you know

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,350
they only offer kind of a handle for you

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,820
to talk about the architecture

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,430
requirements and and the adoption levels

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,860
will be decided over time and it will be

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,230
following the market requirements by

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,230
different players different markets may

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:36,519
have different needs from from from

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:40,810
these specifications so you can think of

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:45,190
SPSA and CBSA as profiles and we may add

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:48,750
additional profiles as we need so the

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:52,600
firmware side we have looked at the

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:55,000
landscape so we have the SVR which is

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,230
actually very successful it's being used

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,810
by many os's

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:04,540
some of the voices require the SPP are

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:06,820
other os's can support SB PR or with

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,980
other built models as well right so I

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,260
kind of put this picture together to

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,120
show the how the things are working in

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:18,550
the in the field today and and so so you

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,149
know this is actually very good

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:25,390
indications of the successes for the SBR

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:28,329
and then we're going to separate out the

00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:31,810
interface requirements and then we can

00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:37,390
build different recipe for different OS

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:40,000
needs so the goal of the BB are we're

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,670
going to create a BB a document to cover

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,459
the egg profile market beyond just

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,649
servers we're going to establish some of

00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:50,709
the common interfaces requirements the

00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:53,230
PSC I guess MCTC as I mentioned before

00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:56,140
everybody is using that for arm systems

00:13:53,230 --> 00:14:00,190
right and then we end on top of it the

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:04,120
UEFI cpi-m bias requirements which is

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,870
used in the SBB our situation today and

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,370
we are also going to add the device tree

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,949
requirements pointing to the device tree

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:15,060
specification because some segments of a

00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:19,300
car systems are supporting device tree

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:23,620
technology and instead of having the

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:27,130
profiles we call these recipes for the

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:30,069
oasis so the first well-known the recipe

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,529
is the SP PR which is using the

00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:36,160
combination of the UEFI CPI and SM BIOS

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:39,490
to support the number of Oasis that I

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,940
specify here you know Windows VMware Red

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:46,630
Hat Oracle Amazon a lot of these devices

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:49,329
require the SPP are some of the other OS

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:54,010
is like Suzy a bunch of freebsd in that

00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:56,199
bsd they can support spr as well but we

00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:00,130
we are in the process of introducing new

00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:03,970
recipes so for some of the more embedded

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:07,560
looking systems you know it's it's

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,510
easier to support a reduced set of UEFI

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,690
typically putting UEFI bi on top of you

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:18,250
boots and then they can support device

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:22,149
tree right so so this could be a recipe

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:25,660
for for that class of operating systems

00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:28,569
like yocto and and then on the cloud you

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,240
know service providers

00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:35,019
we know Google and Facebook are wanting

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,089
to have Linux food to replace the you

00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:40,630
know the Dixie side of the UEFI motto

00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:42,990
so Linux boot can be combined with

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,360
either device tree or a CPI to support

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:50,050
some of the OS is that these these hyper

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,680
scalars are using so we may be providing

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:56,800
a recipe on that front as well and as

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,110
other os's are showing up we may we may

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,220
be able to take a look at you know what

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:05,620
other recipes may be necessary and so so

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:09,100
these two diagrams I'll quickly just

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:13,990
show the relationship so ebbr is

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:16,000
requiring us a subset of UEFI right and

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,120
then you can either combine which device

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,220
three or a CPI and the SP bi is

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:27,069
requiring UEFI CPI and SM BIOS so so if

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:32,529
you do SBB are you pretty much satisfied

00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:34,329
the ebbr as well and in terms of the

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:36,850
linux food it basically replaced the

00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:39,990
UEFI portion and especially the Dixie

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,790
portion of the implementation and and

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:47,730
then you know you can support the OSS

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:51,730
that supports an expert they can also

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:54,279
put a UEFI ABI on top and make their

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,639
system as BBI compliant as well to

00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:01,149
support other voices I think if you went

00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:06,280
to the open source from work conference

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:09,309
last year you know Google showed a kind

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,819
of a proof of concept of such a system

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:15,370
booting Windows so it's kind of

00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:19,589
interesting to look at these kind of

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:21,850
relationships and of course to run these

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,579
certification programs like server ready

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,799
we came up with the compliance tests

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,490
right so the ACS the architecture

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:33,309
comprise suite you know we we get we're

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,580
looking at reorganizing getting into

00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:38,510
matching the the BSA requirements BSA

00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:46,580
document and also that

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:47,929
our recipes so this is what I have to

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,710
share with you today

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:56,179
any questions in the chat there was a

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:58,340
statement from David awesome looking

00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:03,140
forward to seeing this take shape so

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,179
that's great feedback thank you yeah

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,330
this is this is just the beginning I

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:11,750
think you know we would like to share

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:14,630
with everyone as early as possible but

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,910
it will take a bit of time to have

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,710
everything put together we have shared

00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:25,100
some of the the the pre-offer versions

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,679
with the server a/c community for the

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:32,059
BSA and bbr so so this is just the work

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,340
you know the beginning of the work we

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:36,350
have another question any plans to make

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:43,549
the development of these standards more

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:47,530
open yes so ebbr if if you take a look

00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:53,120
at it's already a community developed

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:57,260
specification traditionally the SP SP SA

00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,169
and SB b are defined in this community

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:03,470
community called arm server advisory

00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:06,320
committee the server AC you know the

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:10,910
only requirement to join that committee

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,830
is is a standard NDA was arm but we are

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:17,660
also in the process of looking at

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:21,230
opening this server AC up to be more

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,840
like the Open Compute Project the way it

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:27,440
runs so we're in the process of looking

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,410
at it you know I'm not ready to share

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,460
the launch date but this is something

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:37,429
that we're looking into so I think I

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:40,100
just want to add one point to making the

00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:45,710
standards more open at least for the BSA

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:48,470
and VBR documents is we just want to

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,240
wait till the whole document is final so

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:54,560
we do plan to

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:58,640
the alpha and beta releases of the

00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:01,160
document somewhere on developer.com so

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,580
that is in addition to making a survey

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,920
receive openness Dom already mentioned

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:09,830
yeah this is a great point pressure so

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,830
yeah I think in the next few weeks you

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:15,440
may be able to see the alpha version

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:19,130
right so we we try to be more open to

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,020
the process as much as possible I think

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,360
what Prashant is talking about is

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,930
another way you know not waiting for the

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,480
you know all the opening up of a survey

00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:32,900
see but we are also putting this back

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,880
you know alpha beta versions to the to

00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:39,260
the web to the public website as early

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,230
as possible thank you

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,750
we have a question for IO YouTube wiki

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:50,750
asks what is the process of defining

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:53,960
these specs eg ebbr yeah well so EB BR

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:57,530
is a community built specification today

00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,530
and the spec is actually eaten in some

00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:03,650
sort of github repository and so you

00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:08,060
just go there and you know file the poor

00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:12,080
request basically for the SPSS PPR and

00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:16,040
and in the future the BSA bbr we have in

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,080
the silver AC group we we have the

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:22,610
mailing list we have meetings we have

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,040
mantis ticket systems so if you want to

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,500
add a new requirements or modified

00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,270
requirements you can file the what we

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,080
call the engineering change requests

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:35,330
into the mantas system and and we have

00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,430
you know the members review them and and

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,370
goes through a process of discussion and

00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,290
if adopted we were integrating to the

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:45,320
next release of the document so it's a

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:49,520
well-established process it's the

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,280
community decision to to you know to

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,120
make these you to adopt these

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,120
