Description: 
	SCMI server in TEE
The System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) is a set of operating system-independent software interfaces that have been originally specified to standardize the interface between Application Processors and the power coprocessor. But there are situations where we can't rely on such a power coprocessor. In such a case, the SCMI server has to run a secured partition like OP-TEE. This presentation will describe the status of our PoC of a SCMI server running as an OP-TEE TA. We will present the design, what is already available, the next features to be added and also how this could be extended to other UCs.
