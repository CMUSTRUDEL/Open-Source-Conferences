Description: 
	Empower networking on SmartNIC
SmartNIC becomes increasingly popular in datacenter and telco. It can achieve high performance and rich feature networking, and release CPU resources on server.


In a real deployment, OVS-DPDK on Arm based SmartNIC is one of the common networking solutions. In this presentation, we demo two different SmartNICs for OVS-DPDK, and discuss the advantages introduced by Arm CPU as follows:
1. Flexible and programmable.
2. Highly efficient implementation for complex features difficult to be done by hardware.
3. Fully offloading, include control plane and management plane
