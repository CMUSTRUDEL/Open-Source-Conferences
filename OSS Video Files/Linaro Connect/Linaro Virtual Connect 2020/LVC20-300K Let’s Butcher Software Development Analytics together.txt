	DESCRIPTION
Lord Kelvin said "if you can't measure it, you cannot improve it". That may only be partially true. Instead, I reckon we must understand measurements and their context to comprehend what is going. In the context of software development, this would mean that we must measure the who, what, when, and how related to software development processes, but also know the context around this data to be able to answer the questions that allow managers to drive projects to their goals. I call it the “measurements in context” principle.

This talk demonstrates this principle with humor by looking at Linaro’s projects. Let’s explore together what the software development analytics data shows us about Linaro’s open source projects. Then, let’s guess at what this could be telling us if we had no idea about Linaro. Finally, let’s apply the “measurements in context” principle to get sensible insights.

This fun talk does not intend to answer real questions about Linaro, however, it does show in an approachable and memorable way how to do analytics on open source software. We will stumble in this presentation together over common problems only so you don’t have to do it when it really matters. Lessons learned from the CHAOSS project will also provide a solid foundation from which you can build your own analysis.

During this talk, I will present an approach to drive your software development using data from both strategical and tactical points of view. Everything will rely on existing free, open source tools and knowledge from communities like CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics for Open Source Software) and InnerSource Commons.
