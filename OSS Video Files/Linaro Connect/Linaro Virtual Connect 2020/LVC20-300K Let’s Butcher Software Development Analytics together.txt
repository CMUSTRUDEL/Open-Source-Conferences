Title: LVC20-300K Let’s Butcher Software Development Analytics together
Publication date: 2020-09-22
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect 2020
Description: 
	DESCRIPTION
Lord Kelvin said "if you can't measure it, you cannot improve it". That may only be partially true. Instead, I reckon we must understand measurements and their context to comprehend what is going. In the context of software development, this would mean that we must measure the who, what, when, and how related to software development processes, but also know the context around this data to be able to answer the questions that allow managers to drive projects to their goals. I call it the “measurements in context” principle.

This talk demonstrates this principle with humor by looking at Linaro’s projects. Let’s explore together what the software development analytics data shows us about Linaro’s open source projects. Then, let’s guess at what this could be telling us if we had no idea about Linaro. Finally, let’s apply the “measurements in context” principle to get sensible insights.

This fun talk does not intend to answer real questions about Linaro, however, it does show in an approachable and memorable way how to do analytics on open source software. We will stumble in this presentation together over common problems only so you don’t have to do it when it really matters. Lessons learned from the CHAOSS project will also provide a solid foundation from which you can build your own analysis.

During this talk, I will present an approach to drive your software development using data from both strategical and tactical points of view. Everything will rely on existing free, open source tools and knowledge from communities like CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics for Open Source Software) and InnerSource Commons.

okay so

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,640
thank you very much for joining uh it's

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,720
nice

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,160
now to be at home in the coach to give a

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,000
conference that was expected to

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,679
happen in you know was march in budapest

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,560
now it's happening from home so i

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
hope everyone stays safe and healthy

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
also

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,720
and the idea for today is to talk about

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,480
software development analytics

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,840
and explain a little bit the concept and

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,199
how it's important

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,560
operation use cases for the last part

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,399
and i would like to start by

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
highlighting this idea of digital

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,719
transformation that during the last

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,399
months has

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,760
has been even more important okay

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,280
companies turning into

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
digital transformation area and

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,320
everybody adopting technology

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,239
but starting with this cartoon now okay

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,160
what does it really means it means about

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600
adopting technology adopting solutions

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,160
from outside

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,160
uh we have all been facing this idea

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
okay we need more submittings or slack

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,120
or

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,079
data driven things or coming to a aisle

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,320
and stuff like that

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,239
but at the end of the day the thing that

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,159
i've seen in companies is basically

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,280
basically they are adopting of course

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,200
external sources of technology but

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
also adopting internal development

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,240
itself because they need to

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
integrate all these technologies with

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,200
the workflows and the process they have

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,360
so that means

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,880
that everybody every company is becoming

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,560
a software development company

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
somehow and i would say somehow because

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,960
it depends again on how they are

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,560
integrating all these developers inside

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,280
the company because sometimes it's like

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,439
okay

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,439
it's five firing people just working

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,240
there and and it's becoming hard for

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,640
them to adopt

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,240
all these things in this short period of

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,280
time

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,320
but i will say that the most important

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
thing i have written

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,000
lately about this is this is actually

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
from last year

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
idc report that is an important

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
consulting company that was saying that

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,560
by 2022 and probably

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,520
even faster now over half of the code in

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
75 percent of the new apps coming from

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
companies or apps using the companies we

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,399
will

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,240
review from external sources so that

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,200
means that the code itself is not being

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
developed

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,880
when the majority of the code is not

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
being developed by the company itself so

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
because they are using open source

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,440
technologies or external

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,440
contributions but of course that

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
highlighted open source is becoming more

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,720
and more an important part of the

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,360
consistent of a company

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,239
and this is the the first concept i

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,319
would like to

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,160
talk about the organization's open

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,800
source ecosystem

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,080
like when you're looking at walls that

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,720
is an animal i love

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,920
personally it's okay they are like the

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
company they are all

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,560
partnering together to go for food and

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
to live and make a living

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,680
but they depend on the ecosystem

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,120
surrounding them they depend if they

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
have food they have water they

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,879
have a quiet environment with nice trips

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
and

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,879
things like that and every impact that

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
we may or even they made

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,480
in the ecosystem they can hurt

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,400
themselves so basically as an

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,120
organization as a group of wolves

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
they depend on the ecosystem to grow and

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,000
to success

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
as a community and that's also the same

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
thing for a company so

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,599
if we look at the relationship between

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
the company any organization

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,040
and the open source project surrounding

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,680
them we can see

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
okay they are consuming open source at

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,200
some point most of them as i said before

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,640
and i would say this is an inbound

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,879
process so basically

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
they are using open surprise because

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,400
they are taking libraries from outside

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,120
just to incorporate as part of their

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,799
core project but also because they are

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
hiring companies to provide them

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,080
solutions that are built on open source

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
solution

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,760
but there are also another interesting

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,879
process that related with outbound

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,280
processes like

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,319
though where basically the companies are

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,319
starting to

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,680
someone has rest some has already

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,000
started but they are contributing to

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
open

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,640
source projects and a good example that

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,040
i know is is samsung for example

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,040
they contribute to open source graphics

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,920
projects to be sure that once the

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,400
hardware they are

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,319
working on hit the market there are

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,959
already software ready to work on that

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,599
hardware

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,519
and that's important because if not they

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
would take time to adopt and adapt and

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
basically

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,439
there are already open source prices

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,120
that are of reference in the market so

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,640
why not providing support for them from

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,360
the beginning so people can start using

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,599
my hardware

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,280
from the beginning and that's one

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,160
important part but the other is also

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,479
relatively

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,079
companies that are releasing open source

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,520
projects because they want to create a

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,320
community because they want to extract

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
talent there are

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,000
several motivations to do this so

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,919
basically all

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
these projects these single projects

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,759
together

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,520
are the open source ecosystem around my

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,639
organization and when we are looking at

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,680
how does an open source page look like

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,120
i always highlight this report from

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,479
mozilla this is the mozilla and the

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,919
rebel alliance report

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,560
and it was is publishing

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,800
report.mozilla.community

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,639
and you can see all the projects already

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,759
with monsilla

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,919
how the people those dots are people

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,000
are connected and of course you can see

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,759
firefox have a huge amount of people

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,440
working on firefox a huge amount of

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,280
people working on rust or gecko on mdm

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,039
and the different colors mean how they

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,880
are engaged i mean how they are they are

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,240
core developers regular developers

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,880
casual developers

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,560
those are data we have provided them but

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,320
it's interesting also to see

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,840
that there are people that are not

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,160
working on a single project they

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,000
can be working on firefox and then in

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
gecko and in rust

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,720
so all these dots are connected and and

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,840
that's important because that means that

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,520
people or projects are not islands

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
in an ecosystem they are connected at

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,639
some point thanks to the people working

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,120
on them and if we think about all these

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,240
universe of connections and networks

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,000
around my company

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,479
those are actually the ecosystem i

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,720
should be taking care of

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,320
and that's the next thing that is

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
important as an organization i need to

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,880
be taking care of this ecosystem

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,319
because consuming and contributing open

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,919
source without care

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,759
from experience we know that could be

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
very risky it could be fun but it could

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
be also very risky

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,199
consuming is all these open source

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,120
prices are for free they are for me to

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,800
use so let's go for them and i can start

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,960
using them

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
we know her bleed we know stories like

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,639
that how that things

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,080
end but also contributing when we are

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,600
thinking okay let's release an open

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,680
surprise just putting it

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
on github and it's there and then i can

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,319
use it and people

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
and community will appear you know

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
what's happened next community doesn't

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,319
appear

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,840
and people start blaming like okay i

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
have this nice project and nobody's

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,280
coming so i'm not going to contribute

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
anymore to any open source player and

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
even release anything

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
or even when people say i'm gonna

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,840
contribute this amount of code to this

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
project because i found this issue this

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,680
is my first contribution

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,039
i am a big corporate and people will

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,440
love my contribution

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,120
and sometimes in more healthy

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,960
communities they will tell you okay you

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,880
need to check our guidelines

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,720
you need to please provide smaller

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
chunks of code because reviewing this

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,639
is too much and some people say okay i'm

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,680
not coming back this is not the way i

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,759
would like to contribute

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,199
so basically that means that consuming

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,560
and contributing to open source projects

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,800
needs some kind of

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,199
knowledge some kind of knowledge from

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,360
the organization point of view

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,199
and in its knowledge in three main areas

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,000
i think they are important first of all

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,840
legal so when we are talking about

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
attracting talent that could be a way

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,319
okay

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
so basically it's like how i can go

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,199
there and hire the people that matter to

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,639
me

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,400
probably they are already contributing

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,479
to these projects but also can

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,240
i retain talent from my organization

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,720
because i allow them to contribute to

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,160
open source projects and last but not

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
least there is also a very important

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,080
piece of this that is engineering if i

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
am adopting a technology is because it's

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
part of my engineering workflow so i

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,639
need to involve

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,160
engineering on all of this to be sure

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,680
that they are involved and engaged with

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,080
this participation in open source and

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
again

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,759
that means that we i need to deal with

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,800
so many different mindsets

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,560
from legal to engineering and that means

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,440
that it could be hard

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
and this is where at least two open

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
source projects that are part of the

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,639
linear foundation are

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,960
helping a lot one is the tool group that

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
is

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,440
writing and publishing and discussing

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,440
about guidelines best practices to

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,919
what they call creating and managing

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,240
open source program offices ospos

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,240
and i recommend all of you if you are

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
any kind of organization you should have

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,360
some kind of hospital because

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,280
at some point as i said before you are

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
related with open source trades at some

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,440
point

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,440
but the other one that i would like to

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,960
highlight is the chaos community

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,560
chaos.com sorry ks.community

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,080
where people are discussing about

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
metrics and tools

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,159
to understand and measure the health of

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,560
an open source ecosystem and actually

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,599
chaos stands for community health

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,039
analytics for open source software and i

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,080
think that's important because if you

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,839
don't know

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,839
what's going outside if you cannot

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,760
measure that you cannot understand that

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
and that's this is where we are moving

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,440
towards the concept we would

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,000
like to talk about that is about data

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,519
and software development analytics

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,519
and it's been said this quote i loved

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,120
a lot is without data you are just a

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,880
person with an opinion and first of all

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,360
i would like to say having opinions

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,000
is good but if you have opinions based

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,360
on data or you can

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,480
find from found your opinions on on data

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
and facts is what you can discuss openly

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,760
in a proper way because it's not just

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
your ideas and your thoughts

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
okay they can be right or they can be

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,320
wrong but if you can prove that with

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,839
data they are

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,000
quite interesting to to work on a tab

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,279
and but then we arrive okay now we are

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
talking about software development

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,600
analytics

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,120
it's okay we need data we know that

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,360
there is a lot of things happening out

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,600
there how i can start measuring all

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,519
these things to understand there

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
and i said before you go to cows and

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,080
there are a lot of discussions there but

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,920
i would like to

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
to say that the first thing that is

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,880
interesting is

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
everybody loves data and when we are

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
talking about engineering technical

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,720
people

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,080
it's like okay i can go for this

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,920
especially in companies with digital

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,080
transformation process in place

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,000
when you talk with them they tell you oh

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,720
yes i have a lot of data

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,440
about business marketing and other stuff

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,120
so

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
if it's about software development okay

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
i can go for it i i know

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
i don't need any help and i will say you

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,839
yes probably you need some help and we

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,279
will talk about that later

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,880
because the first thing is where i

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,120
should be looking for the data when we

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,040
are talking about software development

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,200
and of course you could think about okay

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
let's go for coding activity

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,399
it's where everything is happening right

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,160
is when people are writing commits

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,680
writing code and stuff like that

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,519
well that means that probably you need

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,120
to take care of people are using it or

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,200
mercurial

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,079
bazaar there are even people using steel

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,160
just still using subversion

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,519
but that's a small part of all the

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
software development processes because

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,640
probably that development

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,079
start with an issue happening somewhere

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,160
and so okay what's the issue ticking

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,880
system i am using i'm using github or

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,720
dila

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
or vaxilla or when we are talking about

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,839
different projects probably they are

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,040
using different tools

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
and well probably this doesn't start in

00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,839
a

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,600
in an issue probably started in a

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,320
mailing list discussion okay i need to

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,560
go to main man people mail groups io

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,720
or in a chat system like slack matter

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,320
most irc

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
and of course there are processes in

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,800
places like deal with okay contribution

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,959
and stuff like that so

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,079
how is the core review process do i need

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,959
to go to gary

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,320
github and stuff like that and there are

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,440
many other things that we could should

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,120
be taking care of like

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
forums where people can be discussing

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,640
about features of the product but also

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,560
the documentation how is it gonna be

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,880
maintained how it's been maintained

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,399
and when we were lucky to have events

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,079
and meetings

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,240
a lot of people are going to meet ups to

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,720
discuss our conferences or stuff like

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,519
that so all these

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,079
islands of data need to be analyzed at

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
some point

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,959
and you need to integrate information

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,959
between the different profiles of the

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,920
people and all these things become to

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,200
start to be

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,600
somehow crazy but it could be crazier

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,360
if i present the data to the people yes

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,880
how for example this is something we

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
are doing for some customers like okay

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,680
you have this nice dashboard with nice

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,920
colors

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,680
and you will say okay what what what

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,000
this data is telling to me and

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,720
you can see nice charts and probably the

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,680
next

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,120
phase i usually see is okay what what do

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,399
i do with all of this data it's

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,680
overwhelming

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,240
you can see okay there are some

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,839
decreases that says that oh

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,120
people are not working on weekend as

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,880
expected so it's not telling nothing new

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,959
uh probably you can guess that okay this

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,600
is something driven by a community or by

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,639
a company

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,680
by certain data but there's too many

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,120
data there

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,560
to take decisions so how how do

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,880
all these things help me and i would

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,320
like to highlight also this quote i love

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,079
using quotes from my talks about

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
strategy and tactics and with this

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,880
tooling and all these

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,560
materials that we already have we have

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
the tactics we can go there and get the

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,600
data and that's it and with all the

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,240
knowledge we have our big data

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,399
we can do it quite easily but i would

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,240
like to say strategy without tactics is

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,560
the slowest route to victory if i

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,639
couldn't have the the tools it would

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,800
take a lot of time to me now we have

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,240
we should have a strategy and we should

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,240
have some tactics of course

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,560
i have tactics without strategy is like

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,320
i i'm doing now it's like crazy

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,079
and people is overwhelming and nobody is

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,320
taking care of the data at all

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,720
so basically we need a process to to

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
start working with the data and easily

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,560
with this process okay let's

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,480
start by the strategy i mean the study

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
of the strategy in this case is about

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,000
what's the company's strategy when they

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,839
are contributing releasing

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,240
or developing open source or even

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,800
relating the developing software itself

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,399
what do i need what do i want and for

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
example in the case of sanctuaries

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,320
i want to be ready in the market from

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,880
day zero that's that's a goal

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,320
and then okay let's go for an analysis

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,959
process that i need okay

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,800
if you want that which data sources are

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,519
all the vast majority of data sources

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
you already have

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,279
is which ones do i need to analyze and

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,800
which are the questions and i

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,800
to ask to the data that i can be

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,560
answered with numbers like for example

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,399
how fast i am dealing with issues and

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,040
pull requests how many commits i'm doing

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,880
or how

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,880
many of my patches are being accepted

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,800
because that ensures that the software

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,320
is ready once the the hardware is in the

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,880
market

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,560
and once i have those questions then i

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,800
go to the tooling already axis like i

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,279
said before go to chaos and customize

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,440
them to answer to those questions to me

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,360
because then i have reporting i have a

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
mechanism that is uniform for

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,560
any kind of data sources i even you are

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
using boxy logita

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,399
it's okay how fast i am dealing with

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,839
issues that it is not depends on the

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
platform depends on the question you are

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,240
doing

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,839
and then you can have a single point of

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,760
true that you can look at and

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,120
have those numbers and this is also a

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
cycle because then you can go back to

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,519
the strategy

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,040
check the goals and say okay i want to

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,880
be faster or not

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,320
and usually this remembers me a

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,199
discussion in

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,199
in the one of the linuxcon when it was

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,680
used to be the linuxcon conference

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,320
about okay they were discussing about

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
adopting

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,519
garrett for code review processes and i

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
remember someone saying because with

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,800
code review we are going to be faster

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,360
than using maiden list so i asked

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
okay how fast are you now using many

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,240
lists

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,839
and it was i don't know so how do you

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,440
know it's going to be faster

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,720
so let's start with all this cycle

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,160
because i think that's that's the

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,079
important part

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,600
and last but not least and just to

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,199
finish i would like to talk about one

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,079
more thing

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,120
the context because of course you can

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,519
hire a company

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,320
you can hire a consultant or you can

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,040
work on this

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
with some experts from outside but the

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,399
one that know

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,759
the ecosystem better than anyone is

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,759
probably yourself

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,519
and you have all the details happening

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,000
here and and i would like you to present

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,519
a very nice use case that we we know

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,399
about linaro

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,000
uh we are working and this is public we

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,839
are working within our own specific

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,399
analysis of the linux kernel because

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,240
dinar is one of the top contributors but

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,199
when you analyze linaro

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,880
sorry linux kernel contributions and and

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,079
you try to affiliate people usually

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,120
people are using the

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,160
email domain to say okay if redhat.com

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,240
is from red hat with hp.com it's from hp

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,600
and things like that but there are a

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,279
huge amount of people

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,120
that cannot be affiliated because they

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,399
are using their own

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,800
email so basically can you how you can

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,720
say

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
all these people are probably working

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
already for linaro or

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,160
any company that are hiring them is only

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
linaro has that information so

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,920
only you are the ones that can create

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,680
the data to produce that data so it's

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,880
not the data that is wrong it's you the

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,440
ones that have this

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,399
information about the context and this

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,240
is only a

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,160
quick example but there are that we have

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,880
many of these examples happening out

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,399
there that

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,959
when you talk with them we do do

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,680
analysis and present the outcome

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,040
then you have some spikes or some stern

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,240
strange number and someone in the

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
community says oh i know what's

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,279
happening there

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,759
this is because someone left or now for

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,240
example we are also analyzing for some

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,120
organizations how they copy is impacting

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
them in their

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,360
patterns of activity and in some cases

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,959
it's like oh yes because we have moved

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,399
to remote or other people is more

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,959
distributed and then stockings

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,320
taking more time to to respond to issues

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,079
and pull requests oh we are seeing that

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,799
people then i'll start working on

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,079
on weekends because they they work less

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,160
on the on the week and

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,760
they feel bad and probably they need to

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,199
to make more things on the

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,760
on the weekend that you need to

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,439
communicate then okay no weekends are

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,559
you you shouldn't be working on weekends

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,520
right so some final remarks to in my

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,280
my keynote today software development

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,919
matters for sure because now we are

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,080
living in this software development work

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,000
your open source ecosystem matters so

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,320
please take care of it because

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,160
probably the code is not the limited

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,200
resource but the people maintaining that

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,280
code

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,039
are limited so you should be taking care

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,640
of them that means that you need to

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,160
understand your open source ecosystem

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,880
because that helps a lot to take

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,840
decisions

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,280
okay how i can improve my my open source

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,960
ecosystem

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,880
because there are a lot of data out

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
there but you need to

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,080
deal with them with care and again this

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,840
like strategy

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,160
tactics and context knowledge are your

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,600
best tools to manage your open source

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,559
ecosystem and i think that's that's it

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,760
from my side

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,760
this is a slide from from italia and you

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,280
have my contact details so i think now

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,840
we have some time for

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,840
