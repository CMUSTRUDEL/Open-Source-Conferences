The OpenAMP Linaro Community Project is focusing on standardizing aspects of embedded heterogeneous software through open source projects. OpenAMP currently has four working groups solving issues such as messaging (rpmsg and virtio), lifecycle management (remoteproc), configuration standardization (System Device Tree), application services, and common interfaces for hypervisors and AMP. This talk will give an update on what has taken place since the launch at Linaro Connect SAN19, the efforts going on within OpenAMP, future potential topics, and discuss how you can engage.
