so hello everyone thanks for joining i'm

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,680
mateo

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,359
and shibu is here with me and we are

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,360
both the chairman of the board for the

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,480
trusted female tour project

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,759
and today we're going to give you an

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,360
update of all the news for the project

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,680
and everything that happened in this

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,920
crazy 2020.

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,760
so shabu and i have been around

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,080
presenting trusted firmware for quite

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880
long time now a couple of years

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
about six seven in our connects but just

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,080
as a recap

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,840
what is this all about really what is

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
trusted vmware

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,760
so trusted firmware is an open

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,680
governance community project

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
hosted by the linaro community project

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,680
divisions

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,520
and that provides a collaborative space

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,079
really a collaborative forum

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
for developing and deploying reference

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,160
open source implementation

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
of all the secular word software space

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,079
for run processors

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,920
and this is true for either the

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,840
microcontrollers court exams

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,440
and the application processors cortex

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
says and neoverse and all the other

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,239
implementations

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,159
of the a profile and then profile

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,840
architecture

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,400
it's really spread across all the market

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,600
segments and the membership is open to

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
all

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,640
the code is all released under a

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,080
permissive license

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,759
a bsd free calls license

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
the governance of the project is

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,560
overseen by two main bodies

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,240
the board of directors from the project

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,119
company members

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,680
and the technical steering committee the

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,079
board

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
usually decides on the strategic and

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,159
investment matters

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
for the project while the tsc decides on

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,159
the technical issues

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,479
and on the technical direction and new

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,640
procedures and new processes which has

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,040
been applied and needs to be applied

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,399
to the various projects which are part

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,399
of the trusted female family

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,960
so trusted firmware as a project

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
itself is a collaboration project was

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,560
born

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,000
in 2018 when six companies

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,880
six founding members got together around

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,320
the existing

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,360
tfa and tfm open source projects

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,479
trusted firmware for a class dfa is a

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,599
known project

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,040
for quite seven years now it started in

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,280
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,879
and tfm trusted firmware for the

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,360
microcontrollers has been added in 2018.

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,440
so those six companies got together and

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,480
decided to create a community

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,160
around trusted firmware so our

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,319
cypress data eo google linaro npi

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,440
created and funded trusteemer.org

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,239
and quite immediately after we were

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
joined

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,239
by futureway and sd microelectronics in

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,959
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,800
and that was kind of a good boost in the

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,959
development of the project

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,440
together also from a technical point of

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,760
view we were joined by opti

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
which has been donated by linaro into

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,800
this roster female.org

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,959
family and finally this year

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,480
no deceleration actually an acceleration

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,360
in the technology evolution

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,319
and in the collaboration we had nxp and

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
renesas

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,080
joining the project beginning of the

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,519
year and we've also got two new projects

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,840
joining the list of technical projects

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,280
part of trusted firmware we've got embed

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,319
tls donated by

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
arm and hafnium donated by google into

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,000
trusted firmware

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,840
as the reference security l2 partition

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,519
manager

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
so you can see it's really an increasing

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,159
collaboration which aims and

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,000
accelerating the technology evolution

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,000
of the armed secular software space

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,280
it has also been a year in the news for

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,159
trusted firmware and when i say in the

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
news

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,480
not only did i say that because we

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,920
usually publish

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,080
the blog post for new releases of dfa

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,360
tfm and all the other projects

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,280
and shibu also did publish

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,959
beautiful article around the integration

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,159
between 3r toss

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
and tfm but we also literally made the

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,080
news

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,920
in terms of web wire so we managed to

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,680
publish free press releases

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,680
that were e-code in the world um

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,199
first one one year ago when we announced

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
the donation of opti

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,479
by linaro into tf.org it was

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,080
this time of the year last year

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,120
september 19

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,800
and then earlier this year the migration

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,280
of half new and embedded tls

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,560
as part of trusted firmware and finally

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,600
the new companies

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,680
joining renesas and nxp

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,800
really a big boom in the news from

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,240
trusted fema

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,479
so new additions new processes

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,720
new things that you will see in the

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,520
project from now onwards

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
so first of all we introduced a new

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,919
centralized

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,560
security center which is effectively a

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,039
process

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,080
for handling security vulnerabilities

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,120
and security

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,800
security incidents in a collaborative

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,840
and unified way

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,720
so we have one single entry point

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,360
which is the reporting mail alias in

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,560
case

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,960
anyone in outside in the world found

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,280
a security vulnerability and that is

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
here

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,120
we have introduced a process also for

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,840
handling coordinated disclosure

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
and collaboration around disclosure of

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,280
security vulnerabilities

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
because on one side the project strongly

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,639
believes

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,080
in having fixes as soon as possible so

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
upstreaming fixes

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,680
for vulnerable code as soon as possible

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
but at the same time we do realize the

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,919
need

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,759
of commercial entities and partners

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,479
to have a coordinated disclosure process

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,440
so we introduced the concept of two

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,319
specific

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,680
set of partners which are called trusted

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,919
stakeholders

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,600
and ess which is an especially sensitive

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,520
stakeholders

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,440
and these are categories of partners

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,720
which have specific requirements

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,560
for handling the disclosure of these

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
vulnerabilities

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,440
all the processes described in the wiki

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,479
page and there are indications

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
around how a company can apply for being

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,319
considered

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,919
either as a trusted stakeholder or an

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,080
ess

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,240
so everyone is more than welcome to go

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,319
and look at the process

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,680
we've also got per project security

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:43,120
email analysis

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,120
so one for tfa tfm and battery lisot

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,000
that are specifics for that project but

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,720
in general the main entry point

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,840
is now the unified and centralized

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,400
security ad

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,000
for sephim.org and this will be the

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,120
entry point for all the

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,360
security vulnerabilities

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
that's the first news that we have

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,199
deployed

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,960
in 2020 there are many others

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,400
so the second one is we defined

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,599
um quite better the maintenance process

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,319
and we made it completely transparent so

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,639
after a few rounds of public discussions

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,520
which were held on tech forums

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,400
on the mailing list and also on the wiki

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,960
page

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,720
we came up with a unified process for

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,039
handling effectively

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
what well first of all the code review

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,199
process

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,319
so we have a very uh well documented

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,960
uh transparent and explicit

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,120
process to handling code reviews and

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,000
this goes through the definition also

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,360
of which are the project roles so

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,560
contributors

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,840
code owners and code maintainers and for

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,199
every role there is a set of

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,639
expectations

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,800
to be you know fulfilled by these roles

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,639
we have clarified which is the life

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,919
cycle of every patch

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,680
once it enters into the review process

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,680
and we have clarified the contribution

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,120
guidelines

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,080
we've also finally defined quite

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
better than before the support life

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,840
cycle

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,960
of every platform ports so we have clear

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
definitions now

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,720
on when a platform is considered fully

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,479
supported

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,879
only limited support for a platform or

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,800
deprecated because maybe no longer

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,279
maintained

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,599
and as a result of this new process and

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,800
these new guidelines we also pointed new

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,440
maintainers

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,959
especially for tfa and hathnium and the

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,000
good news is that half of these

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,919
maintainers

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
comes from the developer community and

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,040
from partners so they are not

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,399
not anymore armed employees or are

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,120
developers but they are from the

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,640
ecosystem and this shows again the open

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,120
collaboration model

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,480
that the project is really sustaining

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,640
and developing

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,640
around the development revolution

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,839
would you like to take over from here

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:23,839
yes let's start sharing

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,640
hope you can hear me okay and

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
see the slides now

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,920
you can see that okay thanks mateo uh hi

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
everyone

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,519
in this part of the presentation i would

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,839
like to continue to talk about some of

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,720
the

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,959
recent firmware initiatives and

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,040
investments that has happened

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,720
so as matteo was saying in the early

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,560
part of the presentation the journey of

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,720
trusted performance started with

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
uh just two projects that was tfa and

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
tfm

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
uh we had um six members uh fast forward

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,360
two years

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,440
uh we're lucky to have uh now five

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,600
projects and ten members under the

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,240
trusted umbrella which is all

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,279
great uh in the meantime we also kicked

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
off a lot of

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,560
uh collaborative initiatives whether

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,519
it's be the

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,560
mailing list or the tech forums uh and

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,040
what the project

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,800
was starting to feel is in order for all

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,600
these activities to lead to a very

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,839
strong

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,279
collaborative community it is very

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,320
important for us to

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,279
streamline some of these activities get

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
continuous feedback from the community

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,880
reduce

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,720
barriers for developers to condemn and

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,079
collaborate in the project

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,480
moreover there's um always

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
queries coming in from the community uh

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,240
and from

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,760
companies on how uh the community the

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,000
project works overall

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,320
how it is structured etc so

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
the project has now decided that we need

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,880
some help

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
in the form of a community manager who

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,920
can help with some of these activities i

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
just mentioned

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,760
and today i'm glad to announce that don

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,839
harvin from linaro

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,880
has joined the trusted firmware family

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,000
as its first

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,440
community manager and in the coming days

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
and months you will see don

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,279
more active in the community talking to

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
all of you about the

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,519
project getting feedback and running

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,399
some of the ongoing initiatives

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,399
all the best done

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,920
next topic uh so for any open source

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,560
community project to have uh or to allow

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,279
uh contributions from a wide developed

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,839
ways it's quite important to have a open

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,680
test system so that the project quality

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
is never compromised as more and more

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,440
contributions come in

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,279
so for the last one year or so the

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,680
project has been quite committed to

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,639
build

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
a open test system with an initial focus

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,600
on

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,880
trusted firmware a and what and trusted

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,079
firmware m

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,639
and uh the model we had uh is

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,160
just as shown in this diagram here any

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,560
patch that comes into

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,680
a project uh through a get system or the

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,160
github review

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,399
it triggers a jenkins job where all the

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,440
possible configurations of the project

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
is built

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
and the built artifacts and are then

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,519
shot off to the linaro

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,399
validation system that's lava which in

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,480
turns tests

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
all those build configuration with with

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,360
this new patch

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,959
on the different uh end platforms

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,200
and the results are then fed back um to

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,160
the geret system so it gives confidence

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
to the

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,760
developer who pushed the patches and for

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
the reviewer and maintainer

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,519
on the quality of the patch and ensure

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,959
that no regressions

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,560
are brought in as a result of merging

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,399
these patches

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,720
as i said the initial focus has been on

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,920
tfe and tfm today we have got a

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,560
mps mps3 system for kfm and

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,880
a juno boat running a lot of tfa tests

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,160
on a per patch basis

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,519
in the open test system uh this is just

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,320
a snapshot i took of the

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,399
ci.trustedformat.org so i'd encourage

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,480
you to just go and have a look there

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
you will see there are a lot of jenkins

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,320
job which is

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,320
running say tfm and tfm test whether

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,360
it's be on a per patch basis or a

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,519
nightly basis or for release testing

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,519
and this is where we think there's a lot

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,240
of value in pulling together this test

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,000
system that

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
ensures the quality of the projects as

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,160
well as

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,839
um maintaining uh encouraging more

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,160
contributions to come into these

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,800
projects and we are not stopping

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,720
here uh there are future phases of this

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,480
openci that is being planned

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,839
uh with the work coming from the narrow

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
infrastructure team

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
so in the coming months the test system

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,199
would have support for more silicon

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,199
platforms

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,120
qmu should be supported in the coming

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,920
months there'll be support for the arm

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,760
architectural models the fbps uh

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,240
there'll be dashboards that displace the

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,880
results in a more uh consumable

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,560
way for developers and end users you're

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,639
adding static analysis for

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,720
the project so that it's good to catch

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,880
uh issues quite early on

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,839
uh that's going to be a staging instance

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,240
where

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
developers can add more test

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,680
infrastructure at most scripts

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,959
before they are they go live into the

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,760
open test system

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,079
uh as i said at the moment we have got

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,199
uh

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,160
the test system covered for tfa tfm and

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,880
hafnium

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,240
uh we are going to expand that to embed

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,240
tls and opti

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,519
so the vision here is for all the

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,639
trusted firmware

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,440
uh projects there will be the

00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,839
ci.trustedformer.org which hosts

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,199
a test system that tests and maintains

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,880
the quality of the projects

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,240
and there'll be of course documentation

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,399
to support

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,399
this test system as it evolves

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,440
workshops so some of you might remember

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,720
that

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,519
last year around october we had a

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,480
workshop in the beautiful city of eon in

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,040
france

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,480
where we got developers from across the

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,880
globe

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,199
actually as far as santa barbara and the

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,240
west a lot of people from

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,720
europe and from asia coming together to

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,399
discuss the future direction and

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,639
architectural design of

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,519
tfm it was a huge success there were

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,920
around 35

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,440
40 people considering gfm was still in

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,839
its early days

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,000
uh that led to the creation of the

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,040
bi-weekly tech forums for tfa

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,519
tfm optino has got a monthly forum

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,720
uh we would like to repeat that success

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,880
with uh

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,639
the workshop we had last year of course

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
with the current uh restrictions it's

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,120
going to be a

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,199
virtual workshop or we would have

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,399
definitely chosen a another beautiful

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,680
city like leon

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,600
uh to hold the workshop uh so in the

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,000
months of october and november

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,040
uh there's going to be a half day

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
separate tfm

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,279
and mbtls workshop uh it's going to be

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,240
open for all so

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,920
any one of you or anyone in your company

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,199
who would be interested in these two

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,000
projects please do

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,680
dial in the details will be uh posted in

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
the mailing list in the coming

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
weeks uh i would say and the focus of

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,519
tfm of course would be

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
what is the next level of architectural

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,680
evolution uh

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,279
that um the project as a whole is

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,399
thinking about we can have some open

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,360
architectural

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,160
discussions rather than death by by

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
powerpoint

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,279
and for mbtls uh it's a project that

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
came into

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,560
trusted format.org earlier this year

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,000
uh we know that it's a widely adopted

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,920
security library

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,279
uh however the maintainers are keen to

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,480
talk to the uh

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,880
community uh to see how

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,000
we can better the collaboration how we

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,880
can bring in more

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,160
contributions from uh developers in the

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,079
coming months

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,160
so i'm looking forward to these two

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,959
workshop i'm sure a lot of people would

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,959
find it useful

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,920
okay as we come towards the end of the

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,040
presentation i would like to share some

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,959
good news

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,240
uh with you it's a milestone that we

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,600
achieved in the last few

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,919
uh hours as a project so now

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,520
they've got a new trusted firmware.org

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,880
website that has gone live

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,360
in the last few hours

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,120
so we had a trusted firmware.org website

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,079
right from the start of the project for

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,360
the last

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,199
two plus years uh as uh

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,760
the number of projects and the number of

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,520
activities and project assets increased

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,600
what we were finding was it was not

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,240
starting to nicely scale

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,080
to contain all these different projects

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
so the technical steering committee got

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,640
together

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
had detailed discussions on how we

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,880
should renovate the website

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,400
and the tsa decided these three should

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,840
be the themes around which we should

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,240
build the new website

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,559
uh we know there are five projects not

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,799
every developer coming into

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,160
trustedformat.org

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,000
would be interested in all these

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
projects so it should they should be

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,720
able

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,760
to easily navigate to their project of

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,840
interest

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,360
the content should be far well uh

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,360
streamlined uh the pro

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,640
the documents were here and there i

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,880
would say uh

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,679
and of course readability the font and

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,880
everything was

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,240
um i would say was over time getting a

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,600
bit difficult

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,600
for people to understand and with that

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,640
in mind a lot of work has

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,520
gone in uh and uh in the last few hours

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,679
we've gone live

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,559
with this new website and this is the

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,120
home page

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,679
and as you can see uh let's say it's in

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,919
a much

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,280
better shape now with the homepage just

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,799
having information

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,559
around things which are very common to

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,360
the project for example the security

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,480
incident

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,600
response process the latest news which

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,080
is all applicable

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,640
across all the trusted firmware projects

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,880
uh

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
when it comes to the individual projects

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,919
um

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
we have created project mini site so

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,000
that people who are

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,760
say interested in mbtls or tfa just has

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,760
to go to that

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,520
mini website and get all the details

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,320
specific to that project

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,000
and here's a snapshot of how the trusted

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,880
firmware ape

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
mini website looks like so here it is a

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,400
one-stop shop

for everything related to kfa whether

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,320
it's the project documentation

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,480
the code repository the correct review

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,520
system how to subscribe to the

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,679
