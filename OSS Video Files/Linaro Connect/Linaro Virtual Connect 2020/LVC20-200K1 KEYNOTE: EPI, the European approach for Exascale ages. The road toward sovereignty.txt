chairman of the board for the european

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,440
processor initiative

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,560
i'm very happy to be with you today for

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,200
the linaro

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,840
virtual events that we are running on

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,400
together

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,599
considering the cons the cia constances

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,839
in this presentation

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
i will give you some more information

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,039
about the european approach

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,800
for exascale solutions based on european

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,960
technologies

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,840
everything started back in 2015

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,480
from an initiative by jean-claude

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,440
juncker

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,120
who was president of the union angel

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,480
juncker wanted to have

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,920
by 2020 a european existing machine the

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,960
top three in the world

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,559
based on european technology that was

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,960
reinforced

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:52,239
in 2017 with the creation of hero hpc

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,079
who is the organization federating the

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:59,760
27 countries plus plus a few others

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,920
for for they can share the same strategy

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,799
in the high performance computing field

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,080
then yesterday the new president of the

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,680
union

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,880
osulla van der lagen explained that

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,040
the objective to have technic technology

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
called sovereignty in high performance

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
computing

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
is even more important than before and

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,479
the union is going to invest

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,320
during the next six years about 8

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,280
billion euros for developing

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,119
super computers and the technologies for

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,680
super computers this is why

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,799
and this is exactly what she said we

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,040
want to have

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,439
the european industry to develop our own

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,960
next generation microprocessor that will

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,000
allow us

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,280
to use the increasing data volume

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,399
on energy efficient and security

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,560
systems that is crucial for europe on

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,159
from this perspective

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,680
what we have started with the european

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,119
process initiative is

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,920
exactly what will become the central

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,280
piece

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,959
of the european strategy in data

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,000
on it technology for the future

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,680
so when we translate all of that into

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,840
concrete objectives

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,000
epi has as an overall

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,560
strategy to develop a complete

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
european design high-end processor

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,640
addressing

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,120
different fields from super computers to

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,160
edge

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,840
hpc segments so we need to address that

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,640
with different

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
approaches in the short term we need to

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,959
supply

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,599
european design microprocessors based on

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,200
the best ip available on the market

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:53,120
to empower the european exascan machines

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,280
and we also have a long-term objective

00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:01,519
to develop our own ip

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,879
in order we are not at risk of embargo

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,360
so epi as a unique feature in the sense

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,640
that

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,000
we combine the short term objective with

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,120
high tll with long term objectives

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
starting with low tli and we have

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
a magic combination between all the

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
members

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,120
of the project to reach those

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:30,640
objectives so how do we implement that

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,599
we have a roadmap to to develop

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,400
right now based on arm instruction set

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,319
high-end

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
microprocessor that will be in the

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,040
european exoskeleton machines

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,239
this is based on the arm just core

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,360
and that will be manufactured by cycle

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,040
our industrial hands in a

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,080
seven nanometer manufacturing process

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,080
and we plan to have by 2022 the general

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,080
availability of the processor

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
in order they they can be in the

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
european existing machine

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:09,040
in 2023 and then we'll move forward

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,080
with our next gen macro processor also

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,840
based

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,239
on arm instruction set on arm

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,040
architecture

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,400
in parallel we start developing our own

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,440
instruction set base

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,639
on the on risk five today

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,080
this is with low tl on through time post

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,800
2026 2016 2027

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,000
we plan to reach high tll and to have

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,520
the potential to build up our own

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,199
microprocessors in the high-end segment

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,720
based on this technology

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,680
on those two different instruction sets

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,040
will merge with fusion together

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,800
in a single platform that we

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
call the common platform

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,440
the partners we have in the european

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,280
processor initiative are the following

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,400
ones and i will not describe all of them

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,000
in detail

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:06,400
just a note to mention cyper

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,560
which is the industrial hand

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,800
that has been created just for the

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,600
industrialization

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,600
the manufacturing on the setting of the

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,280
technology we are developing

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,680
in the european processor initiative

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,840
so basically we have a transition

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,080
between

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,080
epi with the development of

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,600
ipr to products developed by cypern

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,360
based on epi technologies

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,960
and i will not describe that in detail

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
but anyway you can see

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,160
here the very strong

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
connection between the development of

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,280
technology in api

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,280
on the industrial aspects with cyber

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,840
now let's talk about technology

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
the vision we have for exascale machines

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
is presented on this

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,600
chart we believe that the future

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,360
exascale solutions must be

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,639
workflow engines combining in a single

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,039
framework

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:19,680
the information the data coming from

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:22,400
the world from iot systems combined with

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
edge computing systems on combine as

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,319
well

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,720
with public clouds on all of that

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
will be merged together in complex

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,360
workflows

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,400
that will be run and operated

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,039
in massive exoskelet class or post

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,400
exactly class superior computers

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,919
so to be efficient we believe that those

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,440
exoskelet machines must combine totally

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,960
different technologies

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
they must have general purpose

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,560
processors plus

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,520
different class of accelerators

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,440
some of them gpu so we could have

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,120
different gpu

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,759
in the machine for artificial

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,880
intelligence stuff but a general way

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,280
we could we could have as well fpga

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,479
we could have as well neuromorphic

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,319
solutions

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,280
or we could potentially have in the

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,400
future quantum accelerators

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,479
so we believe that the main strength

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,120
of the arm ecosystem is very visible

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,319
on this chart we have arm that is

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,000
dominant

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:33,120
in the iot field and also

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
in the edge field we start seeing arm

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
visible

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
in the cloud solutions we start seeing

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,840
solutions from

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,520
ampere from marvel it is known

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,560
that amazon

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,400
is working on arm-based solutions on in

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,639
the field of super computers

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
fujitsu has developed an arm-based

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,599
high-end

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,479
microprocessor we are developing a

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,360
high-end

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,800
hpc microprocessor as well so we believe

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
that

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,919
there could be a seamless continuum

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
based on

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
arm solutions from iot to super

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,440
computers

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,720
and we believe that the design of our

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,840
processor

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,680
have to implement that possibility to

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,639
get different accelerators

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,440
so what does it mean to be very concrete

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,280
it means

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,639
that the general purpose processor

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,240
has to be able to combine in a single

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,919
framework different accelerators

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,039
gpu from vendor a gpu from vendor b

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,080
neuromorphic systems fpga and so on and

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,120
so forth

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,920
and then as a direct consequence

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:51,360
the flop in genes the linpack engines

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,519
will be moved to very specific devices

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,519
and that will move to the accelerator

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,720
space

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,519
so how do we implement that

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,040
at the technological level so we have a

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,920
concept of

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,000
common platform on this common platform

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,560
we have a floor plan

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,040
multi-die flow plan on which we connect

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,040
different

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,680
general purpose processors here from arm

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
based on those

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,519
on which we could have the european

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,640
accelerator prototype

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,200
we developed we could embed fpga we

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,320
could um

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,200
embed specific accelerator solutions

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,399
here for instance from caray we could

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
embed

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,800
cryptographic engines and so on and so

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,880
forth on this common platform

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,560
will be connected to external world

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,839
through hbm memories ddr memories

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,440
pci express gen 5 or potentially in the

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,519
future cxl

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,320
so through ccx as well high serial links

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,480
and also with die to die connections so

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,519
we believe this is the only way

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,399
to be integrative and to refer

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,519
to the supercomputer manufacturers onto

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,560
the field

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,959
the most integrative solution that could

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,000
work

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,440
in the past exascale area so now let's

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,279
move to the perspectives

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,880
on challenges for the future first point

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,000
we have to celebrate the fact that epi

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,560
is going to deliver we have rebuilt

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,440
in europe the expertise to develop

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,600
high-end and complex processors

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
and this is the very first success from

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,200
the european processor initiative the

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
second success will be the development

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,560
of a general purpose processor

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,040
by cyper combined with epi technology

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,200
and that will become the central piece

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,240
for the european exascan machines

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,959
so we'll be ready to develop in the

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,920
future

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,680
over the next five to ten years a

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,640
european mate

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,360
fully made european processor based on

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,320
european technologies

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
so now let's be also very pragmatic

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,480
about

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,600
the news the the new situation

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,200
that we are facing nvidia

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,519
is likely to acquire

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
um is it a challenge is it the

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,120
opportunity

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,720
nobody knows yet but anyway this is a

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,920
fact and we have to build

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,920
from that so we believe

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,040
in the european procedure initiative

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
that it is more

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,480
opportunity than a thread indeed we

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,320
believe that combining together

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:40,320
arm which is the general purpose

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,680
technology for the world data flow

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,880
with nvidia artificial intelli

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,600
intelligence ip and technologies could

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,079
offer a unique combination for us

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,079
it doesn't prevent us to keep developing

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,120
our technology or to integrate

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,519
specific accelerators

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
that could make sense for some aspects

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,120
of the workflows

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
but anyway we think that combining

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,600
together

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,959
arm with nvidia could offer a fantastic

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,480
combination

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,920
for making the continuum

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,920
at the data level much easier for

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,880
everyone from hardware developers

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,880
to end users

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,320
so i thank you for your attention and

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
if you have any question on if you want

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
to know more

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,079
you can contact us through our different

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,440
media we have a website and we are also

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,320
