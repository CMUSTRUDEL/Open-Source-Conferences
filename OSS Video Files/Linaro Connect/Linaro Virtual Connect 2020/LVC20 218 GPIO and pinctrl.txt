Title: LVC20 218 GPIO and pinctrl
Publication date: 2020-10-08
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect 2020
Description: 
	BoF session to discuss recent changes and current issues in gpio and pinctrl. For GPIO, we have new uAPI in the works and also the recent GPIO aggregator. For pinctrl, gpiod is starting to incorporate certain pinctrl aspects like bias. Linus Walleij, who is the maintainer, told me he thought is would be a good idea and agreed to attend if I organize it.
