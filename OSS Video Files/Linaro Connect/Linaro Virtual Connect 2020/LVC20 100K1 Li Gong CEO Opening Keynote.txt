greetings everyone uh welcome to linar

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,240
connect

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,360
my name is lee i'm the ceo at linaro

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,040
so it's great to see many of you here uh

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
it's also a little bit strange because

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,439
i'm sitting behind my

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,279
computer at 3 45 or 40 70 in the morning

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
speaking to a virtual audience so this

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,480
is a new experience

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,439
for me as well uh this is the second

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,840
connect

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,720
of this year so typically linaro holds

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
two connects

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,320
each year in april we were supposed to

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,120
hold the first connecting budapest

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,239
but due to the coronal virus situation

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,520
so we have to cancel it

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,879
fairly soon fairly close to the

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,760
time so we were not able to uh

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,719
organize a full connect last time but

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,719
this time

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,320
uh there's a full connect and this is

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
the first time we're actually doing it

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,160
so

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,600
uh i would encourage you to provide any

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,480
feedback you have

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,159
uh through any means you have your email

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
or comments on slack or

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,439
wherever you you could so that we can

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,960
learn

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,600
from this experience and improve

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,720
so before i dive into the keynote i'd

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,920
like to

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,040
say a big happy birthday to linaro

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,520
to everybody as we narrow because we're

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,840
this year we're 10 years old so linaro

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,759
was started in june

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,479
2010 and of course we have done a whole

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,920
lot

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,119
within this 10 years within the slides i

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,200
have a

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,200
graph that i've got from a

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
linux contribution page where they

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,119
computed

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,680
uh all the contributions between 2007

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,640
and 2019

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,759
uh where in terms of individual

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,360
companies

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,479
lenara ranked five in terms of the total

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,000
uh uh patches that that we

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,640
sent to to you know of course

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,040
linear didn't exist in 2007 we only

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,160
started in 2010 so if

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,040
uh if the stat is about 2010 to

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,760
2019 we might probably you know we might

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,040
run

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,080
run even higher that's just one number

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,120
that shows how much we have contributed

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,840
uh in the in the slice i have

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,120
uh somewhat more data but uh

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,640
when i was preparing uh the

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,959
slides i was thinking okay so i

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,920
you know need to do the typical thing to

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
intro

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,400
to introduction of the linaro talk about

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
what we do

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,599
uh talk we have done and then talk about

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,879
the future

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,480
right but as time

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,560
gets close to the to the time now i

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,319
started to prepare for the actual talk i

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,840
realized that we are really

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,760
at a very unique time and place uh

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,280
because you know there's a corona

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,599
safety agent uh much closer to

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
home to my home there's the wildfire in

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
california

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,920
and the smoky air situation

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,159
and then there's a usc election going on

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,959
there's the u.s china technology war

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,840
that's

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,120
getting hotter and hotter and there's

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,239
the

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,599
almost span on wechat which would have

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
impacted me quite

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,400
seriously and then of course the

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,799
industry consolidation

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,480
and and we have heard you know the

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,840
announcement of one of the major ones

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,760
just last week right

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,120
so so much is happening uh this almost

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,879
feels like

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,319
uh what we talked about here doesn't

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,440
really matter you know we shouldn't be

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
talking about

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,519
uh you know day-to-day business because

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,040
so much else is happening

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,840
seems like more important right so

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,799
my feeling is that the world is really

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,920
changing very very fast

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,760
faster than i could speak right so uh

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
so you instead of going through the

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,400
slides and just

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,480
runs through every page uh you know

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
those of you who are not familiar with

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,120
lead

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,440
who would like to uh learn more about

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,320
this can go through the slides later but

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
for this real-time session i'm just

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,720
going to talk about some other things

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,360
that

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
are you know i think to me are more

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,400
urgent and

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,400
top of my mind so

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,080
i want to talk about really

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,560
the things that are changing around us

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,880
and what linare is doing or has

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,160
been doing or has done to counter to

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,280
adapt you know to those changes right

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,639
and of course there are many things

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
turning around this but i'd

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,880
like to highlight a couple that i think

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,720
are very important

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,280
if you think about the semiconductor

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,800
field industry right you know that

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,039
is where linaro is playing and most

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,039
you know most or almost all of our

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,560
customers or member companies are from

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,560
that political field

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,759
if you look at that field in terms of

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
soccer

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,000
you know matches or soccer teams what

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,560
you realize

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
is that many more teams and players are

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,639
coming into play

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,960
and what i mean is not the typical

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,280
situation where a startup makes a better

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,240
product and adds about a

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,479
old player it's not that sort of simple

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,560
replacement what's happening

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,360
is that many companies are coming to

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
play

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,199
not necessarily replacing old players

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,400
but they come in

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,880
at different angles right and

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,759
they they they come you just you know if

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
you just look at

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,840
the whole world there's just so many

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,639
more companies seem to be

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,199
making trips right making their own

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
chips

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,479
right and you wonder why because in the

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
past

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,680
if you are a system vendor you buy the

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,319
chips from

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,759
some supplier and then you make your

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,840
system and if you are an

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
operator you buy the system from some

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
other vendor right then you'll build

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,240
your

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,680
your your operations

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,080
but these days almost anybody of any

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,360
note

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,000
is i either making a trip or thinking

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,919
about making

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,880
a ship and i think there are fundamental

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,400
reasons why this is the case number one

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,919
is that people want to differentiate

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,520
their product

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,639
and people have realized that

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,680
the ultimate differentiation is in chips

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,000
right and uh

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,919
so instead of stopping it

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,440
differentiating at systems

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,720
level people are going into the chips

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,400
uh even try to do customer you know

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,039
customer design trips

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,520
the other factor that makes this

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,800
interesting is that the cost of building

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,639
customer chips is decreasing

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,240
so it's you know there are contract

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,240
houses designing chips

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
for it for you then there are concrete

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,800
houses making them

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,479
for you right so it's a lot more more

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
affordable for companies

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,160
to be designing their own chips but

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,160
that's not the only

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,400
reason there are other reasons at play

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,520
for you example by

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,080
making their own chips is one way of

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,120
securing access to intellectual property

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,039
right and to supplies and if you have

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,240
watched uh the recent uh

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,360
u.s final technology war you will

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,919
realize that that's the

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,879
important part of the equation that

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,759
people are

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,199
calculating every day now right that's a

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,199
fairly recent

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,599
uh consideration but is the important

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,759
one so

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,919
companies people the left and right

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,080
they're they're coming into this field

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,440
and they have an inevitable

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,120
impact on what's happening because

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,039
number one there's certainly more

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,240
companies competing

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,800
but more you importantly if they're

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
by doing their buying their own trips

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,759
instead of

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,520
you know doing their own trips instead

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
of buying from somebody else

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,839
that has a huge impact on the other

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,120
people who used to sell chips right

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,240
so so that's really changing the

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,479
landscape

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,519
for us and another

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
uh observation is that if you consider

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,920
on

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,480
ecosystem as a whole it's no longer the

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,959
case

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,680
that the major players are just hot you

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,800
the software this is our hardware

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,000
vendors right because software vendors

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,640
can also play a very important role uh

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,839
because because the variety and

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,279
diversity of

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,600
different device types and applications

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,839
that is supported within the arm equal

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
system anybody who has a major software

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
play

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
occupies a specific you know very

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,560
important place in

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,600
that space so so

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,360
we need to enlarge our our scope

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,000
to to look at not only

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,880
the existing long-time semiconductor

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
players

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,640
but also the new entrance plus all the

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,800
software

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
vendors that are playing in this space

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,519
right so

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,480
what are we doing to adapt to

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,080
this sort of challenge right so so i'm

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,320
going to speak to several points

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,320
number one is that we are now examining

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,080
you know if we look at the armed equal

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,080
system

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,720
we find that it's not a linear system

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
where use arm plus all the people who

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,959
license

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,519
from our it's really a very complicated

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,680
ecosystem where there are other

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,399
companies and entities in that system

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,440
that has

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,279
their own little equal equal system i

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
say little i'm just

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
sort of a figuratively speaking they're

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,839
not necessarily small right

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,640
you know they can be very very large but

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,839
there are other players other than arm

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,160
who occupy very critical spaces

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,880
and we call this come you know we now

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
you

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,800
internally call these companies

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,040
franchise companies because they own

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,839
important franchises within the arm

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,880
equal

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,560
system now

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,360
you know anybody who makes products or

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,240
what you know

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,360
hardware or software that attracts a lot

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
of followers and

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,440
collaborators those are the companies

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,959
that own

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,959
franchises right so so so the number one

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,160
thing that we are going to do

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
is to be squarely focused on engaging

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,079
with

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,560
franchise companies right uh

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,640
by the way so as i said be before a

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,480
franchise company doesn't have to be a

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,079
soc vendor right a software company can

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
eagle you know can be an equally

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,200
important franchise company

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,200
the second

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,200
step that we're we're doing to

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,720
meet this new challenge is that earlier

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
this year we made see

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,800
significant changes to our membership

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,040
model and structure

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,399
so we now have a very simplified and

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,920
streamlined

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,040
clear model where we have the four tiers

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,600
the core

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,240
membership the club membership the group

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
membership

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,920
and then the project membership

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,000
and for people who would like to learn

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,320
more about the details

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
you can just email us and we'll be happy

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,200
to have a convert

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,480
conversation but the short description

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,600
of this is that it's very simple

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,240
very streamlined it allows companies

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
large

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,200
or small to be able to engage with

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,240
us at different levels and so this

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:25,040
we hope we encourage many more

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,880
companies to come and work with us

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,839
and the third uh point about how we are

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,720
changing is that we're also very focused

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,399
on delivering

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,639
value to our members or to our

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,680
customers you know leonardo over the

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,639
last 10 years have accumulated lots of

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,800
know-how lots of you know expertise we

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,680
have lots of maintainers working for us

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,120
you know we have

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,959
you know over 100 maintainers in various

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,440
projects if you're counting

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,880
uh all the member assignees you know

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,519
member engineers and the

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,079
signings with us right so it's more more

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,200
uh more than 100 maintainers in over 40

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,760
projects right

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:11,360
so dinaro has a lot of capabilities

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,639
where some of those have been uh

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,040
inhibited in the old in the previous

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
world

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,399
right so what we are trying to do

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,200
currently is to unleash them so that we

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
can do more

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,720
for our customers for our members and so

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,360
in the coming year you will see

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:35,600
major actions happening happening there

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,240
and i've taught in the abstract

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
for you know for a few steps that we're

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,920
we're making to

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
extend to the new world but let's you

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,680
give the example

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
for example take google as a example

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,639
right so google

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,760
is not a traditional some economic

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,160
company right

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,839
well it may or may not make chips i

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,600
believe that to

00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:01,040
to other people to especially them but

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,240
google became a core member at linaro

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,760
this year right and that's really a very

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,040
significant piece of news because

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,760
previous previously prior to google

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,800
all the core members of lenara have been

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,800
traditional also

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,920
in soc vendors the fact

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:27,519
that google became became a core member

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,720
means several things one

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,399
is to us google owns multiple important

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,199
franchises within the arm equals system

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,160
android is the most obvious example

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,000
right

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,160
uh all the smartphones use you know 90

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,680
or more smartphones in the world use

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,839
android and

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,880
and android phone runs on arm chips

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,519
right so

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,639
android is a clear example but of course

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,360
you have chrome os

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
you have a number of other things that

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,639
google does

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,079
that each can be a very important

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,399
franchise so

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,279
so if google owns multiple franchises

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,720
within arm

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:10,399
the other direction of this is that

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,880
what linaro does is that we can serve

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,160
google very well by not only

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,360
working on the franchise pieces that

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,959
google has

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,320
but we can also work with them to

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,519
serve their community right so

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,440
this is where leonardo adds a lot of

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,959
value right so uh

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,959
i'm not signing google she's singling

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,519
out google because google is large but

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,360
just

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:46,000
this is a very timely example

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,000
of what where we can do when we look at

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,199
the franchise model to see which

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,279
companies are doing

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,320
important work and how we can work with

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,680
them

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,360
to bring their customers uh into us

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,000
right so um

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,600
one other aspect i want to talk about is

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,399
how we're changing

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,639
is that linare has made important steps

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,639
recently in the recent months in terms

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,839
of opening up our projects and

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,920
processes what this means

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,040
is that basically anybody from anywhere

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,399
in the world

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,959
could participate at different levels to

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,560
in various projects so if you are

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,680
interested in the project

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,680
that we are doing you

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,040
quite possibly you will find the product

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,360
priority page

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,880
completely open so you you can see the

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
schedule you can see the technical

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,160
specification

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,519
you can see what is being discussed you

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,399
can see what is being

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,480
designed or what is being worked on and

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,880
you can participate

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,839
so this is very important because we

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,639
want to really

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,240
you can enlarge the engagement space for

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,079
dnro beyond the member

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,399
member companies of course we'd like to

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,800
have more member companies but

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,799
but beyond that we like to be able to

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,280
engage with other people as well

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,480
so that not only we can help them but

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,039
they can help us

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,760
and so we can help you each other so

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,919
that's a very

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,839
important thing that we are in the

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,280
process of opening up

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,559
many of our projects

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,679
so what this means is that going forward

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,880
we will have

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,480
will hope for is more members and more
