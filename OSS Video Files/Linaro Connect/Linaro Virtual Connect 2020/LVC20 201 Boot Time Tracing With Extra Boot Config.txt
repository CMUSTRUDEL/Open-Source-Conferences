Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect 2020
Description: 
	Boot-time tracing is one of the latest Linux kernel tracing proposal, which allows us to trace kernel booting with full tracing features, like per-event filters and triggers, histograms, instances, dynamic-events etc. Along with the boot-time tracing the kernel command-line interface is also expanded by Extra Boot Config (XBC) so that user can specify complex boot-time settings with structured-key value configuration file.
This talk will show you what the boot-time tracing and the extra boot config provide, the advantages and how you can use it for your boot-time features.
