Title: LVC20 119 Extending SCMI beyond Embedded
Publication date: 2020-10-08
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect 2020
Description: 
	The ARM SCMI specification provides a standardized interface for OS/Firmware coordinated power management. SCMI has been adopted today for platforms primarily targeted at the mobile/client/embedded segment. As Arm-based SoCs increasingly find their way into Infrastructure and Automotive, standardizing Power Management in products targeted at these segments becomes a necessity to prevent software fragmentation.

In this session we will explore how SCMI can be extended to standardize power management for Arm-based SoCs targeted at Infrastructure and Automotive. We will look at how SCMI can work through ACPI which is commonly used in most kernels targeted at the Infrastructure space. We would also have a look at how an Automotive Power Management stack can be setup with the help of SCMI.
