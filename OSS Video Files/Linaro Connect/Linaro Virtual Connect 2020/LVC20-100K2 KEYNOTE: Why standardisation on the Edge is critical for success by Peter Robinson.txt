Title: LVC20-100K2 KEYNOTE: Why standardisation on the Edge is critical for success by Peter Robinson
Publication date: 2020-09-18
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect 2020
Description: 
	Standardisation on the Edge. The cloud and data centre industry is extremely standardised. You can buy any commercial off the shelf server and expect your choice of operating system or variant of Linux to just work. Why isn't this the case for so many of the device edge and IoT devices? We need the same SBSA/SBBR standards and numerous others for provisioning and device management to ensure real success on the device edge in deployment, life cycle management and security or else we will fail!

hi welcome to connect

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,759
it appears when i'm i'm one of the first

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,599
up after lee's keynote

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,960
with a new format for this connect we

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,000
don't even have

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,440
joe's witty facts or dave's always fun

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
challenge anyway i'm peter robinson

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,640
i'm sure a few of them know a few of you

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
know who i

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,480
am but here's a quick intro

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,279
i work for red hat i'm the principal

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,000
architect for device edge and iot

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,559
for the os layer basically it's my

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,880
team's

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,920
job to make the device boot and be able

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,520
to run apps

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,840
so that everyone else can do the cool

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,840
things

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,719
so today i'm going to discuss why

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,320
standards are important for the edge

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,559
as part of my role i work on

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,120
standardization efforts

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,120
as well as engaging and working with

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,039
internal teams at red hat

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,960
open source communities and with

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,359
customers and partners to work out what

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,719
the problems we need to solve are

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,159
and there are many but also

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
um to solve for red hat but also for the

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,439
wider

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,040
linux ecosystem so that customers have

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,560
choice when running their iot platforms

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
if you look at the enterprise data

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
center there's a lot of commercial

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,000
off-the-shelf

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,640
systems that boot and generally work in

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,520
the same way

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,759
but customers are able to run a vast

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,799
array of general or proprietary software

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,159
to execute vastly different workloads

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,040
in a similar method speaking with

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
customers

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,560
they expect the same on the edge

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,119
but a lot of their experiences to date

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
haven't met with the expectations

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,600
so i'm going to cover some of the ways

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,360
edge is different from the data center

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,880
but why standards are still just as

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,640
important

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,759
even in this diverse environment

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,200
so what is edge

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,320
edge is many things and different things

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,640
from the home to the enterprise to telco

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
and even multiple those things to the

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,920
same industry

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,040
a bit like cloud the edge means many

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
things to many people

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,440
it has many advantages these include

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,280
things like reduced latency and

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,840
bandwidth requirements

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
increase resilience and even things like

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,800
data sovereignty

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,760
for where countries can require

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
data to be in particular locations in

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,760
some

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,319
circumstances it provides increased

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,879
security and reduces cost

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,720
but it also has its challenges you'll

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,840
notice some things like security and

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,680
cost appear on both sides of the list

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,440
but also things like environmental

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,319
challenges scale

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,800
and other factors in as well i once had

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,879
a

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,360
customer say to me we deal with

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,680
everything with some of our sites

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,519
including pirates

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,640
as i alluded to in the last slide

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,920
there's also a number of various

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,480
definitions of edge and various tiers

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,000
everything from telco and provider edge

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,159
these can include things like

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,360
5g and 5gb ram cdns and a number of

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,159
other services

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,440
that that telcos and service providers

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
provide

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,879
enterprise edge like retail and branch

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
offices

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,440
as well as factories and warehouses are

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,920
another section of edge

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
but then there's also device edge and

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,280
this area is just

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
massive it covers many different facets

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,519
and types of equipment

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,159
from small battery-powered sensors

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,080
through to

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,599
systems almost as powerful as those in

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,599
the data center

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,879
these can be everywhere from a washing

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,000
machine in the home

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,560
cameras in the street to cars and wrist

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,560
watches

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
different people and different customers

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,360
um

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,599
define edge differently and the

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,360
definition of edge is always quite

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,920
a fun topic to discuss with people

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,400
anyway so why do open standards matter

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,280
on the edge

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,359
i feel open standards are important the

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,000
pc became the instant success

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,720
it was not because of any one particular

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
feature

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
but because it could be readily claimed

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,880
and all these clones could run

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,680
the same software even if the hardware

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,400
was different

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,360
it meant they were widely available and

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,720
wide

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,960
relatively cheap to acquire

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,280
but also things like the internet came

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,400
became a success

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,199
um due to open standards like tcpip

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,600
and http who remembers networking

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,479
protocols like ipx sbx

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,960
net files or decnet they've all been

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,280
replaced by tcpip

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,280
and even some of the early pro internet

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,560
protocols have been readily replaced by

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,560
http

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,880
who remembers gopher being

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,199
open protocols allowed everyone to

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
implement them and for different systems

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,440
to interoperate

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,840
even old mainframe systems that have

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,720
been

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
constantly upgraded from the 1960s that

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,639
used to run

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,800
serial and various other protocols now

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,520
are now connected via ip

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,560
um to do basically the same thing they

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,000
were probably

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,160
doing 20 30 years ago even if the

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,840
hardware underneath has changed

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,560
open standards provide low barriers to

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,360
entry

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,320
so open implementations in software to

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,320
consume

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,320
but they also protect companies

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,759
investments

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,720
they prevent lock-in remember

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,560
lock-in is a two-way street well it

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,520
means customers can leave you and go

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,479
elsewhere

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
it also means that your platform could

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,080
be the reason

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
the customer is leaving it also means

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,479
your platform

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,479
could be the reason customers are

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,960
leaving the others

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:15,520
it allows competition and allows

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,319
companies to move and adjust as

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
various things change some companies may

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
not be around

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
in a few years time and so the ability

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,039
for them to be able to move software

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,000
or hardware to different platforms

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,000
is very very useful

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,680
i won't spend a long time on this slide

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,720
as i'm sure everyone has seen it

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,120
and if you haven't go and check out xkcd

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,960
standard slide it summarizes the need

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
for open standards quite well

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,160
i mean just look at the amount of

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,400
wireless standards there are

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,400
so

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,360
um you know while we're talking about

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,280
hardware and software um

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
hardware standards and various other

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,560
things there's also other standards that

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,759
are useful on the edge

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,599
enterprise standards things like

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,080
um companies are used to things like

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,919
linux distributions just working

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,520
um and so standard enterprise

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
distributions like

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,000
rel and umantu as well as other

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,599
community ones like fedora

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
centos and debian being able to run on

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,440
any platform

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,160
without changing and having custom

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,919
kernels

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
and various other bits and pieces are

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,880
important companies whether they're

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,599
telco or

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,280
enterprise don't want different os's and

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,120
different procedures

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
for each different device they need to

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,479
support

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,160
on the edge there could be thousands of

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,000
different devices

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,560
from larger servers high-end machines

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
doing artificial intel intelligence and

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,720
inference

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,319
to small gateways and

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,000
they don't want every single different

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
device to have a different operating

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,759
system and a different software stack

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,080
they want to be able to choose a single

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,360
uh software operating system

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,759
an operations stack that allow them to

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,800
run

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,680
on whatever hardware they want and

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,919
whatever hardware is best for the job

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,680
if they've got tens of millions of

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,680
devices or even only

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,319
thousands of devices out there there may

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,039
be three or four different requirements

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,400
for devices and having different

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,680
software stacks

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,080
for each of those makes it hard

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
because

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,760
so and and having a single software

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,760
stack and a single

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,240
standard for booting and securing

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,279
enables more secure systems knowledge of

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,279
reuse by data center admins

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,600
and and then to choose the right

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,600
hardware for the job rather than being

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,839
stuck with single hardware because of

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,000
the software stack they chose

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,839
they basically want their edge software

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,480
to look and work like the data center

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,519
software

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,880
so their developers can deploy the same

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,040
things the same way

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,320
and their operation teams and sysadmins

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,320
can share the same knowledge

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,480
this sort of rolls into security as well

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,399
devices on

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
the edge are often running workloads

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,200
similar to the data center

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,080
they contain critical information such

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
as vpn

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,240
proprietary software and algorithms but

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,040
rather than just the physical security

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,040
of the software

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,920
um rather than the physical security of

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,000
the data center with four walls and

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,200
access control systems

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,279
um and authorized audited people

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,320
they they're strapped to light poles

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,360
pipelines

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,240
pumps often in the middle of nowhere

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,000
um a customer once said to me you know

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
we don't even bother putting up fences

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,680
around most of our equipment because

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,200
it's so isolated that someone could just

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,839
drive through the fence

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
or climb over it and even if we had

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
cameras there

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,120
they would be away and gone with all the

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,320
pieces before

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,800
we even um managed to respond

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
in in the central location so they just

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
don't even bother us an extra cost they

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,760
don't need

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
so we need so to secure devices at the

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,000
edge we need higher levels

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,079
of security and lockdown to provide

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,040
security as close to the physical data

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,040
center as possible

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:36,720
things like tpm's for critical recovery

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,560
of non-critical information the trusted

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,120
computing group standards with

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,640
the linux aimer for measurement and

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,120
assesstation

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
ufi secure boot to verify that the

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,959
operating s or the

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
software stack hasn't hasn't been

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
changed

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,839
between reboots and also emerging

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,320
hardware technology like security

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,760
enclaves

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,399
with um

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,760
softwares such as those technologies

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,160
working being worked on in the

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,800
confidential computing

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,320
confidential computing consortium will

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,920
also help here

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,399
um and also standards like parsec from

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
the arm

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,200
also standards like parsec to make it

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,440
easier for developers to secure

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,880
critical information and data across

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
different devices that may have

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,680
different hardware

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,000
that way they don't need to care about

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,120
whether they're speaking to a tpm

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,240
or a pkcs11 interface

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,720
or some other hardware technology they

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,600
can basically just use the same api

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,279
and and be guaranteed that the

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,279
information is stored securely

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,839
that also brings me to provisioning on

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,600
and on boarding standards

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,639
there's a number of ways to

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,079
implement devices uh implement os and

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,680
deploy devices

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,399
um from bare metal um how do you get a

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,839
remote

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,079
device up and running without specialist

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,160
people

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,440
how do you make these devices work

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,720
without rolling a truck

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,480
or if one fails get it up and running as

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
quick as possible

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,720
how does a company ship a device

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,720
directly from the manufacturer to any

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,680
site they like and have

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,200
an on site employee such as an oil

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,519
worker

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,279
or a retail assistant get it up and

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,839
running without the

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,360
needs of it specialists and how do they

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,120
do that for thousands or tens of

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,600
thousands of devices

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,360
for any device from any manufacturer in

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,760
any region

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,040
if an i.t team is centralized in the us

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,639
and they need to deploy

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,880
a device to australia or to singapore

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,680
or the middle east do they want to be

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,440
flying out specialist engineers

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,720
or do they just want to um

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,639
log a ticket with a supplier and have

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,560
that supplier ship the device from the

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,160
nearest location so it can get there as

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,120
quick as possible

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,639
so things like secure device onboarding

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,079
that came out of intel

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,320
and is now an arm and intel

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,200
collaboration i feel are critically

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
important

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,079
um to some of the standards for edge

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
being able to securely onboard these

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,720
devices

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,200
using people in the field

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,839
is the only way we're going to scale and

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
secure

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:37,440
devices um in a way that

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,320
edge needs and similarly

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,000
as we go up from hardware into the

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,279
software layer

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,279
it application standards are useful

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,839
and containers are where it's going in

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,839
the data center

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,440
and are completely hot for development

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,600
process

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,839
at the moment oca oci containers

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,959
continue the vendor agnostic standards

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,560
further up the stack

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,800
you can easily deploy the same

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,839
application in the data center

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,000
as on the edge using the same methods

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
each application is independent of the

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,720
underlying operating system

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,600
and ever every other opera every other

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,639
application

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,639
running on the system they can each have

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,199
their own choice of libraries

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,639
they can be updated independently

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,680
controlled separately

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,440
and isolated from one to the other

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,440
so that if one of the applications get

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,800
compromised it doesn't necessarily mean

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,079
all the applications

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:42,000
are compromised or the underlying os is

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:46,000
compromised and it can be dealt with

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,240
in a single way also having

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,440
you know devops processes and ci

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,480
pipelines

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,800
um assists in

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,279
um deployment and standardization in

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,120
this method

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:04,079
thank you um i'll be around

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,800
on slack for any other conversation and

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,279
there's also

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,560
a bunch of other talks later on in

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,040
linaro connect

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
around some of these things um including

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:18,959
a parsec one

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,959
