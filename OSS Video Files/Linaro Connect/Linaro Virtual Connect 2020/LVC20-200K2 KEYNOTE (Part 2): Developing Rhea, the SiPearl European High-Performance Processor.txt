hello i'm craig prunty vp of marketing

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,799
for scipro

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,559
i'm glad to be here virtually at lenaro

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,080
connect 2020.

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,400
today i'm going to talk to you about

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,799
sci-pro and the european

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
server processor i'll give you an

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,199
overview of sci pro for those of you who

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,400
don't know us

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,119
and our value proposition our target

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,279
markets

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,960
key partnerships and then i'll discuss

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,039
the high level architecture and design

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,320
elements of our first generation

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,640
rhea processor and the common platform

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
associated with our processors

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,640
we'll talk a little bit about ecosystem

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,559
and then the software elements and where

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,879
groups like lenaro are making a

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,200
difference

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,160
sorry pro cipro was founded out of the

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
european

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
processor initiative to develop the

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,680
european

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,960
processor solution our headquarters are

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
in maison lafitte

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,320
it's just west of paris with a second

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,160
design center

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,120
in duisburg germany near dusseldorf

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,199
our head count we were founded in 2019

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,880
our first employee came on board in

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,280
january 2020 we're now at 22 people and

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,680
growing coming from companies like intel

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,880
like atos like marvel with good

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,080
hpc and server processor experience

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,680
our architecture is based on the arm neo

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,680
neoverse zeus cores and we're targeting

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,640
our first generation to go into the eu

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,320
pilot machines as well as the hpc

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,479
european exascale machines

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,079
our value proposition can be summed up

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,439
as p3s

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,720
so four elements performance security

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,200
safety sovereignty so first performance

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,799
our first generation high performance

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,600
server processor is defined on the

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,040
designed on the

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,960
arm neoverse zeus cores the zeus knock

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,920
and associated acceleration

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,479
eu serenity is important for us we were

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,399
founded

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,680
through the eu commission we are

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,799
developing four

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
european customers for european markets

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
and we will sell

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
outside of europe but our target in

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,640
terms of development

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,239
is the european market the flexible

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,840
common platform the idea here is

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,840
decoupling the design and scalability

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,959
of the general purpose processor and

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,520
accelerators

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,560
while closely coupling the performance

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,920
of the two

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,760
and we'll talk about that in later

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,400
slides and finally

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,800
safety security and data protection are

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
key

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
values of europe and the european

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
commission

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,319
in terms of our target markets they're

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,160
very important for hpc

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,599
but even more so for the follow-on

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,599
market such as edge

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,480
and automotive and we'll be bringing

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,080
innovation there

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,080
our market strategy is tied to

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
sovereignty we'll target european

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,400
markets and design for

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
european customers our first market will

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,519
be high performance computing with our

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
rhea processor

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,760
and we'll work on focus on time to

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,200
market to ride the european

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
exascale wave beyond that then cloud

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,440
computing is

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
growing in europe and the european

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
commission is pushing this forward with

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,360
initiatives

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,760
like gaia x

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,360
the edge workloads quite often are

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,440
similar to the cloud workloads with a

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,040
different cut in software focus on

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,400
focusing on elements like lower latency

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,560
and local processing capability so

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,120
overall scipro cover the full range of

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,400
advanced computing from high-end hpc

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,239
to edge devices the world

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,280
of arm hpc so ecosystem

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,799
being key here a fully fleshed ecosystem

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,480
allows you to build more systems the

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,159
more systems you have the more you can

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,200
do develop your ecosystem

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,319
so folks here at lenara are not

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
surprised to know

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,879
that arm is the most widely

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,159
used isa on the planet over 200

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,879
billion processors sold today 200

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,959
billion

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,000
that's a lot of processors if we look at

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
the map here the

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,439
the arm world uh obviously across the

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,439
u.s europe

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,799
china and japan we can start in japan

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,080
with the fugaku system for hpc

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,759
this took all the top awards this year

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
the first uh arm system hpc system to

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,320
hit the

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,080
top of the linpac scores top of the hpcg

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,040
as well as the green 500. in europe you

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,919
have the

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,880
montblanc systems at cea as well as in

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,840
the uk

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,560
the catalyst systems and the izambard

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,400
system

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,560
at gw4 and the us sandia

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,520
astra system as well as the system at

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,080
stony brook

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,000
and other research systems are driving

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,520
ecosystem development

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,880
application porting and really growing

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,280
the world of hpc

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,520
the epi is an important partner for

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,039
cipro actually epi consortium has

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,639
26 important partners for cypro

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,479
i'm not going to spend a lot of time on

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,560
this slide jean-marc just gave a great

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,800
15-minute presentation ahead of mine

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
describing the api but i am going to

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,320
summarize the

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,360
goals of the epi to tie them into this

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,039
presentation

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,520
so obviously the development of a

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,680
general purpose high performance

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
processor which cypro is bringing to

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,039
market high performance

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,440
risk 5 based accelerators

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,720
computing a common platform for edge and

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,800
autonomous cars

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,080
and also targeting other important

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,840
markets in europe

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,280
such as ai and big data so the target is

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,880
to take

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,720
ip2 product and epi innovation

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,720
into cypril end products

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,919
now we're getting to the meat of the

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,199
presentation we'll talk a bit about

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,440
ria or hyperscale processor now this is

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,319
a non-nda presentation so i can't go

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,360
into great detail on our block diagrams

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,440
or design elements sorry our design

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,199
specifications but i will talk about

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
some of the design elements that we're

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,919
using

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,039
starting with the zeus cpu core

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
and again a very high performance cpu

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,680
core

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,000
connected to an intelligent memory

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,840
subsystem and supporting of course

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,440
the arm ecosystem

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
uh this is connecting up through a

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,600
coherent network on chip

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,639
a memory coherent network network on a

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,639
chip

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,960
and it's topology aware so we can scale

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,240
this

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
up and that's important for us to be

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
able to address multiple markets again

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,639
hpc

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
a very high performance market a lot of

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,720
cores but some of our other markets

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,240
requiring lower performance so you want

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,759
to be able to scale the chip

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,880
or even an hpc to uh to either create

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,680
multiple number domains in a single chip

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,039
or a single pneuma domain across

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,680
multiple chips

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,880
and of course arm gives a good isolation

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
between the compute units

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,560
which is also important for our markets

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
um rounding out the memory subsystem you

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
see here

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,960
high bandwidth memory for uh high

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,840
bandwidth of course

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,520
and then ddr for high capacity and again

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,120
these all connecting to the network on

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,120
chip so having coherence

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,080
between the memory domains and finally

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,039
our high speed interface so pcie gen 5

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,120
as well as

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,160
c6 links for coherent interfaces

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,400
and then a low power low latency

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,319
dyed to die interface to support our

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,319
common platform

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,720
which we'll talk about in the following

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,720
slides

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,560
here we come to the common platform this

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,080
is an innovation coming

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,400
out of the epi the idea is to

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,560
separate the design of the general

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,440
purpose processor and the accelerator

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,240
to allow them to scale separately but to

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,720
closely

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,240
couple the performance this allows you

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
to integrate the best in class

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,160
processor cores and you can innovate on

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
the acceleration

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,639
side you can leverage uh industry ip

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,120
and share that as appropriate across

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,160
the two technologies and you'll be able

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,319
to leverage

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,599
the foundry and manufacturing

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,199
technologies

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,479
that make sense for each element

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,319
we'll talk about this more in the next

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
slide

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,520
so here we have a representative diagram

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,840
of the

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,440
common platform this is not an actual

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,800
diagram this is just representative to

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
show the different ways that we can

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,479
connect

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,279
up the accelerators to the general

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,839
purpose

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,000
processors so traditionally you have

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,599
the accelerator connected over a pci

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,159
express interface as shown at the top

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
here

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,519
and that would be either on the

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,080
motherboard or on an adapter card

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,600
um maybe even over a network more and

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,240
more you're seeing connections

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
over coherent interfaces here we show c6

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,800
could be in the future

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,720
cxl or some other coherent interface

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,800
and this gives a more closely coupled

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,200
performance because it's memory coherent

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
we are developing a dye to die interface

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,880
we plan to make

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
this an open standard so anybody can

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
design

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,640
design on this die to die interface now

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,959
the advantage of this is

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,000
you can put then a chiplet in package

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
that chiplet

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,839
again it's decoupled in the design it

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,959
can be in different geometries you can

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,480
scale the size

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,880
as you wish you can also take advantage

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,399
of

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,440
ips sitting in the general purpose

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,720
platform by using a high-speed dynadie

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,920
interface you can avoid

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,440
avoid putting interfaces in your in your

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,040
accelerator chip or

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
memory in your accelerator chip and you

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,320
can take advantage of that

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,000
over the low latency high bandwidth

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,519
die interconnect to use those ips

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
in the general purpose processor this

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,880
can save you on development time

00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,320
time to market and development costs

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,320
overall ip costs

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,680
in terms of a design goal we're focusing

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,839
on a balanced high performance processor

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,560
we say balance we're talking about

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,360
calculation performance versus memory

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,360
bandwidth

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,480
and for hpc this is an important

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,200
measurement

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,000
traditionally in hpc you have very high

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
performance

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,120
uh processors with with poor memory

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
bandwidth

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,480
this is good for linpack scores but it's

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,279
usually bad for most

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,120
workloads you want to run so the goal is

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,000
to have a lot of performance but also a

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
good balance between

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,279
your memory bandwidth and this is where

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
the use of hbm

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,560
as well as in chip in core

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,560
acceleration the combination the two

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,560
gives you high performance

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,200
but also high memory bandwidth

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,279
typically uh hpc systems architected

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
today especially to get to exascale most

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,200
experts believe you're going to need

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,160
both accelerators and general purpose

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
processors

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,360
so the accelerator will give you that

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,560
flop engine

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,440
to get the high lin pack score or high

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,560
flop count

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,600
floating point operations count

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,480
so in a system getting

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,000
codes to run on a gpu or any kind of

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
accelerator takes a lot of work

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
and optimization so the number of codes

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
that actually run on a gpu is very

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,360
limited

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,160
most of the codes rely on the general

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,959
purpose

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,160
portion of the system to get the job

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,240
done

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,079
and this is where again having the high

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,560
flap count that gets you the linpack

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,200
score

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,519
gets you to exascale having a good

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,240
well-balanced general purpose processor

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,440
that gets you a good working hpc system

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,920
for the majority

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,920
of your actual workloads and customers

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,880
ecosystem so this is one of the most

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,519
important slides in the deck but

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,959
probably needs uh not that much talking

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
from me the folks at leonardo

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,279
i'm sure understand the importance of

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,079
ecosystem so

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,040
good hardware without software is a very

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,079
expensive

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,279
paperweight or doorstop

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,120
so here you see a lot of logos

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,320
there this is representative it's not

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,360
everybody in the

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,120
arm partner universe but

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,399
each one of these is a brick that had to

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,079
be shaped

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,120
and set over time to grow the ecosystem

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,320
for arm

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,959
if you consider calzetta to be the first

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,320
arm server company they started founded

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,440
in 2008

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,120
then this has been at least 12 years in

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
the making to get this ecosystem in

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,720
place

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,399
which i think it became self-sustainable

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
a couple years ago where it was growing

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
organically we

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,959
we didn't have any we didn't have to go

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,399
and push things to get done we had

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,320
people coming to us and saying hey i

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
ported my code ported easy

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,839
i'm i'm tuning it now but the port was

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
super easy or

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,200
my tool chain you know i bought a server

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
i ported over my tool chain it's running

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
now

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,800
um can you help me understand a little

00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,680
bit about these these performance

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,440
elements

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,519
so the ecosystem now is uh

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,040
is a key element for arm and it makes

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,079
arm a real

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,079
viable server processor alternative

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,560
our final slide is showing the hpc

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,560
software stack for arm which is another

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,360
way of saying the software ecosystem

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,560
so i get asked a couple of times a month

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,240
why we're not

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,360
designing server processors on risk five

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,480
cores why are we using

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:39,120
arm cores and the answer is of course

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:42,240
ecosystem the color coding on this slide

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,920
it goes from red to dark blue light red

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
to dark blue and

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,279
that's this is designed to show the red

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,079
is where we're showing spending more

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,440
time and effort

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,079
as it scales on things like uh library

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,079
support

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,839
or you know language

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,160
compiler support takes a bit of effort

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,680
on our part then going to the dark blue

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,639
where it's mostly the

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,519
end users or partners and we support

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,399
them

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,720
so thanks to the folks at lenaro and

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,600
other organizations developing

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,800
this software ecosystem the entire

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
ecosystem

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
this has made a big difference in terms

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,440
of bringing arm server processors to

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,279
market

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,279
please continue helping with this

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,320
this concludes our keynote you can

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,440
we appreciate the opportunity to speak

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,519
here at leonardo connect and we hope to

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,519
