Description: 
	Guide to Parsec
Parsec is the Platform Abstraction for Security, an open-source initiative that aims to create simple, standardised, ergonomic software interfaces for interacting with hardware-backed security features on any platform in any programming language. Parsec has now been accepted by the Cloud Native Compute Foundation as a sandbox project, which makes this the ideal time to learn how to contribute. There is plenty to do! This developer-focused session will provide an overview of the Parsec architecture and its long-term vision, along with a guided tour of the code base, and some pointers for getting started.
