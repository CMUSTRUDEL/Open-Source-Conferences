Title: LVC20 212 Let's Grow the 96Boards Community
Publication date: 2020-10-08
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect 2020
Description: 
	96Boards team and partners like Arrow Electronics worked hard to promote, and make 96Boards visible in the embedded designer community. During this session I am inviting the audience for an open discussion on how to make the 96Boards more popular, more competitive against the standard development platforms / board makers.

	00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,160
so welcome everyone my name is attila

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,720
ambrose

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,359
i'm from arab electronics uh working

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,160
here for

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,320
more than five years responsible for

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,519
some sport solutions

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,560
also covering the emea 96 boards

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,600
activities

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,320
inside the room uh today

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,680
i will have a very short session so i

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,199
will be fast

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,920
uh i would like to hear your comments on

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
on how to improve the awareness of the

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,559
of the 96 boards

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:38,559
uh what can be what can be done

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,280
better and what are the main uh problems

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,760
which actually blocks the 96 boards to

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
have

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,800
bigger awareness on the developer

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,160
community

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,120
so let's see the 96 boards in numbers

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,559
uh if you check on the 96boards.org you

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
can see that we have

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,600
18 boards from the consumer specific

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,320
edition

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
we have five from the enterprise edition

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,920
nine

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,680
iot boards three some edition boards

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,320
and 22 mezzanine cards if we add

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
all these together we will have around

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,040
60 boards

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,680
in comparison on the project uh number

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,640
of posted projects on the 96 boards

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,840
it's only 84. so if you calculate this

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,400
it's like uh 1.1 1.2 projects per

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,759
per board that was created for the 96

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
boards

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,840
so actually this means to be

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
a brainstorming session so i'm really

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,880
encouraging

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,079
you to to give your uh input

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,920
how can we be more visible for the

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,920
developers for the community

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,000
how can be more competitive against the

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,320
alternative development kits like

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,439
raspberry pi arduino platforms or the

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
dedicated soc manufacturer development

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,040
kits

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,399
so i really would like to hear your

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,240
thoughts on what are the

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,159
issues we have with the 96 boss

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
community and what are

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,599
the things that we should done to make

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,720
it a better way

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,800
actually i'm listed for example some

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,879
uh problems but i i'm assuming we have

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
so the still low awareness in the

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,920
development world i'm

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,080
organizing a lot of trainings

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,120
based on 96 boards platforms what we

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
created

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
actually i'm starting always with

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,000
whoever

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,560
heard about the 96 sports community and

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,680
the

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,160
result is really low like 1 in 20 people

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,120
pricing comparing the competition like

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,879
raspberry pi

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,599
is uh is can be one issue

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,239
and competing against soc manufacture

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,519
dev kits can be another issue

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,560
a lack of real 96 boards

00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,599
cross-compatibility

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,480
because we have the standards we have

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,920
the

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,480
specification that provides the

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,480
compatibility on the hardware level

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,040
but actually when you just want to plug

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:19,840
and play any mezzanine to any baseboard

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,840
you will be facing uh so much trouble

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
so actually i'm really interested in in

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,239
your thoughts

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,280
in your inputs what can be done better

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,680
i think we can we can see the slack chat

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,519
or

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
or you can you can post any anywhere on

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,640
the zoom if it's possible i don't know

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,720
so i'm checking the the slack chat if

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
you have any inputs please free free

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
also if anyone wants to raise their hand

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,200
i can i can unmute them

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
that's that's that would be the best

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
yeah

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,159
um i'm sorry i'm already in the position

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,519
so i can do it myself

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,720
but um i have a couple of

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,639
comments on on the issues um

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,080
especially like being so close to the

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,120
team um

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:33,360
so the i don't see the price

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,199
factor going down unless someone

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:41,040
takes a hit on the actual sale so

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
till stock vendors

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,120
treat it treat the boats as a product

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,759
it's always going to be

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,120
expensive but once you treat it as an

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,240
investment

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,280
uh and actually take a price hit or like

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,120
even a loss on sales of each board

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,120
in order to gain more traction and more

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,400
more customers for your stock itself

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,759
till then prices can't be lowered down

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
we saw this with the

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,120
chameleon 96 recently it just went down

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,600
in price

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,280
by a lot uh it was being sold for more

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,479
than a hundred dollars and it went down

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,440
to 30

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,080
um and sold within minutes because uh

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,680
just

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,280
it was cheap enough that people wanted

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,080
to get the hands on like

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,199
now uh after that board has been

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
released so many

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,759
years after that people are actually

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,720
working actively like i have

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,600
we am on one of the telegram communities

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,479
um

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,720
on our discord on the arm dev cave on

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,400
the arm discord channel and everywhere

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,320
like i've been talking to people who are

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,120
working on bill root bills

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,680
uh working on getting up distros using

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,320
the

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
upstream linux kernel working but what

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,199
what happened again back in the day was

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,000
that chameleon 96

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,759
um i am not just i'm talking about the

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,560
camille 96 as an example

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,880
and and don't want to name shame anyone

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,479
but

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
because that board just suddenly went

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,160
down in price and we saw the immediate

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,520
effects of that

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,039
so taking price

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,400
as the factor um like

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,160
vendors needs to understand that

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,039
that taking a loss is why you make dev

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
boats

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,160
not to make profits um

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,479
same what happened with the uh dragon

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,479
board

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,240
14c like it was almost sold at a cost

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,520
from what i understand at 75

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,120
and then the ultra 96 again uh like that

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,600
fpga is expensive and 200 is

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,639
a very very very low price for what that

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,160
fpga can do

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,160
and what it's actually worth so

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,800
yeah so as you are you are seeing a

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
big potential in in investing in

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,840
development kits

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,080
yeah just to lower the price below the

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,960
the market price and

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
and with this we can we can reach uh

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,080
wider

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
audience with little boards yeah that's

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,120
a good point

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,280
um yeah actually actually we are

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
at least arrow i can i can speak in the

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,919
name of arrow

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,000
we are trying to reach at many many

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,720
customers many many people with

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,599
with actually free on hand boards so we

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,560
are running

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,560
multiple campaigns we are giving away

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,000
boards on on events

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,440
uh so we usually cannot go lower

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,639
on that you need to understand that uh

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,479
uh we cannot just give away boards

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,560
without you know the

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,560
the project potential behind it

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,319
so any other points

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,720
from anyone else

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,919
don't be shy we are certain in the line

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,639
and

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,639
we are really interested in anyone's

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
opinion

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,159
so i don't see any inputs on the chat

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,159
actually i'm being pinged on discord by

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:45,200
david he cannot unmute or join slack so

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,240
um his question is what about booting

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,160
and what how would

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
like would standardization standardize

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,240
booting help

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,279
um and i i guess what he's trying to say

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
is like

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,959
like upstream kernel support and

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,440
upstream bootloader support

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,839
so that you're not always tied down to

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,720
vendor bsp

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,279
and you know the wind sometimes like the

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,600
drivers

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,200
they provide are not what you really

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,240
need so again i'm

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,240
i'm kind of going back to my gpu session

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
that i just had

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,399
um a lot of the times i've seen like

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,279
vendor drivers being locked down to

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,560
westin

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:28,959
or api sorry the westin

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:32,080
renderer and

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,760
that's all it can do and other other

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,760
weird works like that

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,200
where you you'd want some functionality

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,920
with uh

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,360
that's introduced in linux government

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,519
5.8 or 7

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,560
but like the vendor bsp is locked down

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,760
and not upstream

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,120
and you're getting like 3.12 or 4.2

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,440
stuff like that so um this um and again

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,279
uh taking one of the examples of the

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,480
boards we have the avenger 96

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,560
uh the song provider dh core invested

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
and they actually uh sponsored up

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,040
streaming of this bird

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,839
and you know it has great surface

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,560
support now

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,040
um so i guess that the question is that

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,399
how

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,880
like better upstream uh from the

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
get go

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,079
yeah this to be a good point also we are

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,440
we are

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,160
seeing that from our soc partners

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,600
uh this is a demand more and more from

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,120
their side as well

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,120
and actually they are they are going

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,480
that to that direction to

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,600
to have upstream and mainstream uh

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,880
lineup support on their bsp uh

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,079
so what we can see that uh they they

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,360
really recognize that this is a must for

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,519
their uh

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,640
processor solutions and those are for

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
the dev kits

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,800
uh so actually i think in the future it

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
will be

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,360
more like standardized and this will be

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
driven from the soc side as well not

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,120
just

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,959
from the 96 board partners

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,720
yeah i think also we we might want to

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,720
start advertising that

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,240
actually using that because like again

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,839
for the avenger 96 and a couple more

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,839
boats that's been up same there's no

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,800
actual distro that uses that upstream

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,000
kernel

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,160
um so maybe talking with guys at fedora

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
or even having like a york or metal

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,279
layer that

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,040
uses the abstract upstream kernel rather

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:28,880
than the psp one

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:31,519
makes life a bit more easier

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,519
yes i agree

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,800
so we have a chat have you guys followed

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,560
what pine

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,360
book pro pine book python uh are going

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,519
or are doing sorry it's a very active

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,720
noisy community 96 wars

00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,560
could do well in trying to convince and

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,040
one of the oems to open up an older

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,040
products

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,959
so actually i'm not really aware of this

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,240
uh

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,240
uh pine phone and and buying book

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:25,839
i will check

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,160
and there is a post from dania thompson

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
how much of the 96 boards ecosystem is

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,560
professional development

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,600
being paid to make products they will

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
never contribute

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,839
projects for the community they are also

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,839
happy to pay enough

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,839
to allow the boards to be sold

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
profitably

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,720
yeah so actually uh we are we are in

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,720
partnership with a lot of

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,360
companies and there are different uh uh

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,320
business model with them actually we are

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,800
we are

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,720
trying to force them to create a

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,320
profitable product

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,399
which then it's they uh initiative as

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,920
well to drive it and then support it

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,600
well to finally or in the final

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,920
it it will sell each uh sell itself and

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,399
we

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,120
we don't need to need to really force it

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,320
and

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,000
and and to make a really

00:13:50,320 --> 00:14:02,800
big market around it to to be sold

00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:05,120
and this is the main target for us now

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,160
what about trainings uh around the

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,760
boards i don't know

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,560
no one reached this point uh

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,720
if we can we can build up some uh

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,000
general 96 boards uh

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,880
trainings or webinars which

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,160
actually the people can go through have

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:30,639
a certificate at the end or something

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:32,560
what do you think sahaj

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
oh i i was reading another comment

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,040
someone posted

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,240
it on uh on my older uh

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,440
slap chat which is actually

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,000
for you for you so they're posting your

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
slack now can you can you repeat your

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,959
question

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,279
yes actually i was thinking about

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,480
organizing some standard

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,839
96 boards webinars or seminars

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,600
around the 96 volt ecosystem like

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,680
multi-week

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,600
webinars where the people at the end

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,920
will get a certificate or

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,560
or something that they can use

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,000
do you think that it would open open up

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,760
a huge

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
channel for the for the audience

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,519
um yeah i i think so but

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,800
like we really need to

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,880
invite more sock manufa

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,560
soft retailers and board

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,199
like both builders pro makers

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,639
um so people you've already worked with

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,440
people

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,199
and people that already have uh 96

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,560
sports products that we feel

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,320
might might not reach our expectations

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
uh in terms of compliance and all of

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,759
that stuff so like a few webinars

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
um to just go through what the actual

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,839
compliance

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,720
means uh and that

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,519
ups and and then a few more about up

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,399
streaming and

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,199
stuff like that that should do some good

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,199
maybe educate people a bit more

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,399
rethink the ways they've been operating

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,040
because like

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,639
it's it's a known fact like you know

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,279
providing a bsp within a

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:21,040
virtual machine image that's not uh

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,360
that's not uncommon like that's a very

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,240
common practice in the embedded space as

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,120
bad as it may seem but people do it so i

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,199
guess there's a

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,399
fair bit of education that's required um

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,320
to get people uh to understand what is

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:40,560
actually required to

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,560
sell associates and sell the boards

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,000
he actually would be great to to

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:56,000
give the people the basic knowledge so

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,639
using that they could really uh boom the

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
the project sites of the on the 96

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,720
boards

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,640
because i believe that the 84 projects

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,039
which already exists on the site is

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,880
is a really low number in comparison of

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,679
the of the number of boards that was

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:19,839
released

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:19,839
in the last couple of years

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,400
checking in in the chat there is one

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,400
on slack as well

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,400
for 96. i've always wondered why there

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,360
is not

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,200
more of an emphasis put on the boards

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,919
being open source hardware

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,360
schematic and layout cad files published

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,320
as open source

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,160
this helped grow the viewable community

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
and i think it is a way different from

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,200
the raspberry pi

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,120
where there is no interest in open

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,200
source hardware documentation

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,120
isn't it the best interest of silicon

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,320
vendors and linear members

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,440
for 96 boards to be to go different

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,280
divine

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,880
reference designs for their sources

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,919
so it's actually a good point um

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,360
for some of the some of the boards i'm i

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,400
can speak in the name of aero

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,960
electronics

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,760
uh we we have the design files and

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,000
everything

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
but actually it's so complex so i

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,720
believe it's

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,840
it's it's not easy to to use it for your

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,000
own product to customize your own

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,960
product

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,400
also we are working with with some and

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,760
board manufacturers who

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,640
of course don't want to to give out uh

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,760
the work they put into designing these

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,760
boards and storms

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,360
so in that case of course they want to

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
sell their products as well

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,200
so it's not possible to to make it open

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,480
source

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,760
so this is the the two options uh

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,799
but i believe that as as the

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,720
socs and dram routes

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,840
and everything is getting more and more

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,600
complex

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,440
uh the customers are not

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,799
really can make benefit from having the

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,720
the design files of such a board this is

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,760
my feeling

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,919
and and i believe uh the software

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,000
support is is is really

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,880
getting a bigger and bigger help for

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,120
those customers who want to

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,120
actually work with these new processors

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,160
and and yeah just to like add to that

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,960
as as per our compliance we do require

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,960
all of the

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,480
board manufacturers to provide

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,200
schematics

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,720
and we try to enforce that as much as

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,240
possible

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,559
so schematics and uh

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,120
the layout cad in terms of if you just

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,480
want to like make cases and stuff

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,240
that's usually generic uh between a lot

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,880
of the boards sometimes the stock

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,520
placement is a bit different depending

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,360
it's

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,200
uh depending on if it's on the top or

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,960
the bottom side of the board

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,320
um but like the it we we do

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,880
have a fair amount of codes that

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,600
uh provide both current layouts and

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
schematics

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,120
yeah that's true and also usually when

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,600
the

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,640
uh customer is coming to aero

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,520
electronics

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,120
and want to actually uh do something

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,520
similar to

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,159
what he has in this hand knight six

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,559
board

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,240
we are really happy to to support it on

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,200
on any any level

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,320
from schematics to to designing and and

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,080
whatever

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,080
mainly mainly on the bomb level

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,679
so it's not uh not a

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,799
hidden stuff but actually we don't

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,240
really want to

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,480
to have the customers go directly uh

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,679
our business model is is like uh selling

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,080
components so

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,280
that's why we want to want to keep the

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,880
customers what we

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,880
reach out with the 96 words

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,840
so any last comments because we have

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,840
three minutes left

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,559
so a couple of things coming in chat

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:59,840
i'm not sure i can answer or reach

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:59,840
each of them

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,159
so we are still

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,520
uh discussing the the

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:19,039
layout and schematic and pcb cad files

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,840
uh on the chat so

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,400
there are some people who are agreeing

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,679
to

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,200
to to source it out and some people are

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,840
not agreeing to

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,600
to share it with with customers because

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,039
