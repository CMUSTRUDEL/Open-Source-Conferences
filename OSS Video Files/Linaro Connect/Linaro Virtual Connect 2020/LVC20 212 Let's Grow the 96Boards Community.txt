Title: LVC20 212 Let's Grow the 96Boards Community
Publication date: 2020-10-08
Playlist: Linaro Virtual Connect 2020
Description: 
	96Boards team and partners like Arrow Electronics worked hard to promote, and make 96Boards visible in the embedded designer community. During this session I am inviting the audience for an open discussion on how to make the 96Boards more popular, more competitive against the standard development platforms / board makers.
