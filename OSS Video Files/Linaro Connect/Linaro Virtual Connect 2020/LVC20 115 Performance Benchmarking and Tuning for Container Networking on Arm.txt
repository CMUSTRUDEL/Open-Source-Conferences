	Performance Benchmarking and Tuning for Container Networking on Arm

Arm ecosystem is becoming much more popular in cloud native applications than ever before with its increasing wide use. Arm devotes to be a cloud native vendor and puts much resources to enable related projects on its platform. Container networking is the key to high performance connection for cloud native computing and there are a number of Container Networking Interface(CNI) solutions, such as Flannel, Calico, etc.

In the presentation, we would like present our recent work result on the performance benchmarking and tuning on various CNIs of arm:
1. High performance evaluation environment and tools used for benchmarking;
2. Networking models used by CNIs which actually affect the final result;
3. Benchmarking metrics(IP, TCP/UDP, HTTP) and results of the various CNIs on arm
4. Comparison between CNIs and analysis to the bottleneck factors with the graph
5. Our performance tuning to them and their improvements
from the Linux system and usage model aspects
