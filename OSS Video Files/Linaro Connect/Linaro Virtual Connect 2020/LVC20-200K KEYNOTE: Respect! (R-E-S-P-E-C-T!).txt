Free, open source software is mainly founded on legal tools, like copyright, licenses. From a lawyer's perspective, that means "compliance". But I want to extend the concept of compliance, by outlining that complying with the rules means *respect* for other people's work and interest. With the paradigm shifting, with more and more workloads happening on the cloud, this is all the more a crucial point, needing respect, besides compliance.https://sched.co/dU7C

hello

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,559
um thank you for having me

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,960
i always feel a little bit awkward

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,080
when i speak at a technical event like

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,760
this

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,199
on legal things because well

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
legal things are boring and there is no

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,880
denying

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,840
that so finding something that is useful

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,040
and keeps the audience at least

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:36,480
alive if not entirely awake

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,480
is a major challenge

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,079
therefore i have picked up

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,480
one of the most boring subjects

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:52,239
i could possibly come up with compliance

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,000
so i confess i tricked you into thinking

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,120
i was going to

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,079
speak about rhythm and blues songs

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,879
or indeed the subject is one of the most

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,799
intricate

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,920
subjects i could pick up

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,360
but fear no more i'm

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,600
not going through an endless list of

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,920
things you need to do

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,200
i am going more to the root of it

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,680
why do you comply or do not

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,680
comply

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,759
one easy answer would be because i fear

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,960
fines and damages or

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,240
also because i would

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,520
disrepute it if we

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,040
i will be called

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,960
or again because if we are forced to do

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,960
something when the product

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,079
is already out there will be much

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,200
higher cost

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,479
all these answers include

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,719
an element of fear which is indeed a

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,280
strong motivator

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:11,599
but does that tell the whole story

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,440
i submit it doesn't

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,440
but first a question

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
how many chances do you have to ever get

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,440
caught

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,280
for not achieving perfect compliance

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,440
how many copyright holders do know

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,319
what the conditions are actually imposed

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,160
by

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,800
their own license are and how many of

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,840
them

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
actually bother

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,480
mileage varies but the answer is

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:53,280
by and large fewer than one will think

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,160
i have only anecdotal evidence

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,080
for instance um i and a client once

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,440
found a very clear violation

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,330
concerning a a gpl

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,640
library committed by competitors

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,800
[Music]

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,519
we told the developer a phd student from

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,239
the us

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,680
that his library was distributed in

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,959
software

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
that was downloaded in probably millions

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,720
of copy

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,280
in italy but it was

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,239
totally unimpressed and decided not to

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,200
do anything about it

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,400
and of course we not being copyright

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,440
holders

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,840
had no business with enforcing his

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
rights

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,360
many times likewise

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,480
in a public list of free software

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,159
foundation europe

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,720
where i do volunteer some of my time

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,640
we receive violation reports by

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,400
non-copyright holders

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:03,120
and sometimes really hardcore

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,120
but nothing we could really help with

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
in all these cases

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,400
was it a wise decision to be in breach

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,600
of the license

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,359
the outcome maybe yes

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,880
or was it well with the remarkable

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,560
uplift in the use of

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,280
open source there are surprisingly

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,160
few cases concerning free and open

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,160
source licensing

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,560
when i'm recording these

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,360
i i wasted the green light for

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,080
announcing

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,160
that we have settled the first

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,400
reportedly

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,280
case hitting a courtroom in italy

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,479
other major jurisdictions report one or

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,199
two cases some

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,919
report none what do we make of this

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
what are the reasons for this very

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,000
little

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,600
level of litigation well

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,160
deficient and enforcement are a costly

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,440
exercise in some jurisdictions an ip

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,560
case is simply out of reach for many

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,919
but i believe this only provides a small

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,919
part of the story

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,280
compliance perhaps incomplete and

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,440
patchy but in a good enough fashion

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,639
does exist and more and more companies

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,680
are getting

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,840
more aware and sophisticated

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
in compliance why

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,120
we are in a complex society motivation

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,240
for compliance could be

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,240
of different nature but i submit

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,720
it comes from observance of social

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,759
norms punishment is rarely applied

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,680
rarely but despite these facts we are

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,000
not going down the streets robbing

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,360
everybody and their dog neither we do

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,880
we enter in break

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,840
shops and dwellings there are

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,240
rules that are complied because people

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,840
feel

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,520
this is the right thing to do i concede

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,199
there are parts of the society where

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,639
these basic rules are not

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:34,400
necessarily observed by heart and

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:38,560
deterrence must be there just in case

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:42,479
but after all the very word

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,919
normal comes from norm

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:50,160
anomalous in greek therefore

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:53,199
according to the rules indicating that

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,080
what is in accordance with the rules is

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
normal

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,120
and vice versa in my

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,560
observation the most voluntarily applied

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,599
roots are those which

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:12,400
meet some basic requirements

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:16,639
they are simple and straightforward

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,479
at least the gist of it is

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:25,759
and therefore they can be known

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,759
and followed up without too much effort

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,240
they are reasonable and

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,240
self-evident

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,919
predicting if the rules would work in

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,199
practice

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,960
is seldom easy

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,160
but apparently nearly all kind of open

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,280
source licensing

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:52,160
seems to fare well in this respect

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,120
not just because open source is

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,720
behavioral better

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:03,039
not necessarily at least but because its

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:07,759
requirements once explained

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:10,720
and understood are reasonable

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,199
i'm telling you a story which is in some

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,280
ways surprising

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,160
on a totally unrelated subject

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,720
smoke ban in public areas in my own

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
country

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,080
italy has been one of the first to adopt

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
a total

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,880
ban in public areas

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,560
but in designated ones when it was

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
announced

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,599
everybody was concentrating on issues

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,919
like

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,039
who is going to make this law comply

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,320
with

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,320
who is going to check

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,640
announcement of disobedience were

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
announced by

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:57,120
some public figures almost nobody

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,120
predicted an easy entry into force

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,600
indeed there was already a law dating

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,360
back

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,120
1975 prohibiting more or less the same

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,760
in the same terms and

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:15,839
more regulating regulations followed up

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,080
all doomed with failure

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,600
you know restaurants in old bars you

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,600
know pubs you know

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:28,800
public public areas it was impossible

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,800
to find a non-smoking area

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,080
moreover the first day of enactment was

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,360
january 1st

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,560
people were supposed to huddle

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,080
out in the cold winter to get their shot

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,920
of nicotine

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,959
no way skepticism

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,160
was paramount we

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,760
all expected a swarm of litigation to

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
put the law to a stencil

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,080
january 1st passed and so did january

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,800
2nd

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,800
and 3rd

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
although all of the sudden we allow

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,399
realize that

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:16,839
everywhere and i mean everywhere

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,519
people stopped smoking public

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,720
areas in the middle

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:28,079
of a cold winter smokers indeed

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:31,519
huddle outside but inside

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:35,040
the air was clean and breathable

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
what does this story tell us

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,959
that if a rule is sufficiently clear

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:49,680
and with limited exceptions

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:52,800
it is more likely to be to be followed

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,160
even in a culture where finding

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,040
loopholes

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,040
in laws is the second national sport

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:08,079
second making a rule work in practice

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:10,399
implies making it socially acceptable

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,560
when it's socially acceptable and

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,959
accepted

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,160
then you are somewhat compelled to

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,440
comply

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,800
because everybody else does

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,640
and this is what you are expected

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,640
and expect others to do

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,800
as adults we have learned

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,560
that in order to be respected we need to

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,560
show respect unto others

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,440
and this is why i

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,360
chose this title of this speech respect

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,880
r-e-s-p-e-c-t not just because it's a

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,760
wonderful song in

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,279
one of my favorite movies but because

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,639
compliance

00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,240
in a nutshell means respecting

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,600
and being respected

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,560
after all what does compliance do open

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,760
source licenses

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,279
terms mean it means

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,079
my house my rules i am giving this for

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,120
free

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,360
but i demand that at least

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,320
abc are respected conditions

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,160
the deal is clear there is no hidden

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,360
small breed

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,040
you know everything everything you need

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,399
to know

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,600
beforehand there is

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,800
then it's up to you whether to engage in

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,360
this transaction

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,800
or to leave it what would be intolerable

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,440
is that you take it anyway

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,160
while openly ignoring the conditions

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,639
that

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:56,240
would be disrespectful but i

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,760
hate all the intellectual property

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,880
language as is

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,800
in you you stole my intellectual

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,160
property

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,560
instead of you trespassed on my rights

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,560
but since the legal deed for open source

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,360
is some condition to receive the

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,480
software for

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:19,360
free then using a word like

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,360
immoral will not be very far from truth

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,360
how you showcase your respect

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,760
first by acting respectfully

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
but of course others could simply not

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,519
notice

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,720
which is not necessarily a bad thing

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,600
after all

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,760
one does not get praised for being a

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,000
decent person

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:48,079
does she another way is to

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,839
pledge to something specific

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,880
something that runs the extra mile

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,320
to show disrespect uh

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,959
this other action could be some hallmark

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,560
of

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,160
excellence some commitment to a higher

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,279
standard

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,680
something verifiable

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,320
this is the case for instance of formal

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,680
programs

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
certification programs

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,639
one of them is obviously

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,959
open chain uh the

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,920
the linux foundation sponsor standard

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,720
but there are programs that are worth

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,839
noting

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:37,920
maybe less known or less far-reaching

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,720
for instance reuse or

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,720
clearly define

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,279
already using spd-x in the bill of

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,480
material and in the

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,519
software heaters rather than just

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,519
natural language

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:59,440
is a part of open chain process but if

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:04,079
everybody started with just announcing

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:07,440
what their software is licensed under

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:12,000
in machine possible way wouldn't that be

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,880
a good thing making a gentle move making

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,720
it easier for others to read through

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,320
your technical and illegal stuff

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,279
instead of just rolling

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,000
legal documents and placing source code

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,440
in a massive way just to make the cut

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,519
that is a form of respect it's like

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,720
having good handwriting

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,000
mine is terrible but i

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,320
make efforts

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,519
of course people could read what you

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,800
scribbled what

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:50,000
why making their life

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,360
miserable and having your name cursed

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,800
for the

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:59,279
extra effort that this requires when

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:04,079
with a little bit of well respect

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,079
you could avoid it so

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:12,880
by doing it and by announcing it

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,920
and following your promises up

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,199
with something recognizably

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,320
useful you would reassure your

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,440
counterparts that they can rely on you

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,639
and that you are

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,880
therefore a respected member of the

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,480
community

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:38,320
the more we all do it the easier

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,680
and normal it will become

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,959
and the more we will all

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,959
breathe cleaner

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,800
unpolluted air

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,480
thank you and i remain available for

00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,880
any questions especially

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:05,839
what is italy's first national sport

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,839
thank you

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,720
