The Embedded Base Boot Requirements(EBBR) specification defines requirements for embedded systems to enable inter-operability between SoCs, hardware platforms, firmware implementations, and operating system distributions. EBBR is targeted at making operating system/distros agnostic to platform. Same operating system image should run on any hardware with a well-defined firmware interface which is EBBR compliant.

There has been a significant work going on in U-boot with regards to EBBR in the open-source community. Various features like bootefi are already available with many other features in queue.

This presentation aims at explaining how EBBR specifications gets mapped to NXP platforms and demonstrating EBBR compliance for NXP platform. The reference boot-architecture will be based on TFA, u-boot, device-trees, Linux and OPTEE (for secure uefi flow). This will demonstrate distros like SUSE running on NXP SoCs using bootefi command, secure uefi flow, etc

Also efforts are going to ensure that the U-boot is EBBR compliant by running FWTS, SCT for EBBR. The idea is to make the u-boot feature complete and can be demonstrated as EBBR compliance on NXP devices.
