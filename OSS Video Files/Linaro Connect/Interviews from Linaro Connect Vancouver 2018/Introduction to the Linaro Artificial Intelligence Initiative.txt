00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:09,660
we're donating RNN which is arms

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,450
software inference engine which is

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,700
designed specifically to plug into the

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,830
existing machine learning frameworks but

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,710
also to be optimized to run across the

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,949
widest range of arm ARM based platforms

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:27,599
CPUs GPUs called XM called XA etc it's

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:29,310
constitutes about a hundred man years of

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,759
effort we've been working on this for

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,130
some time we've had it under open source

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,559
licenses for some time but we are now

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,930
donating our men in into the denaro

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,629
machine intelligence initiative in order

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,250
that we can have open governance as well

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,230
as open source the announcement we've

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,270
made is that we're going to open source

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,430
arm and then we're going to work with

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,190
lonardo on a machine learning initiative

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,440
and continue to resource this with the

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,379
aim of getting Arman n support across

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,379
all of the common arm platforms that you

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,390
see so that means support for CPUs and

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,129
GPUs that aren't produced it means

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,140
support for other people's devices as

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,460
well through a plug-in interface and the

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,439
idea is that you've got good support

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,720
across all of those different pieces of

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,159
IP and good connection into the machine

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,740
learning frameworks and the tools that

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,310
you use on top of it the arm and an SDK

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,680
announcement to me is about identifying

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,110
that there is a lot of fragmentation in

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,479
this space and that there is a lot of

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,119
duplicative work being done by companies

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,680
that are solving the same problems and

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,049
doing the same work and a lot of it's

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
not differentiating and so this is an

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,860
opportunity for companies to try to

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,310
identify where there are areas for

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,170
collaboration and then to try to let

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,180
companies do the differentiation is

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,670
really a cold warm call to action for

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,520
other companies to come on in to join to

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,920
contribute and get involved so this is a

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,100
major change and we're really excited

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,380
army is taking this big step that will

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,700
really make an impact in in the industry

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,070
joining the machine intelligence

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,570
initiative means that they can join the

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,829
board of the technical experts that are

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,170
planning the evolutions and the

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,930
improvements joining the initiative

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,450
means that the engineers will be able

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,640
to use their hardware platforms in the

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,230
daily development and they get all the

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,510
continuous integration testing and

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,600
builds on the board

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,600
