Title: Transition to OpenBSD 5.6, part 1 - Peter Hansteen
Publication date: 2019-10-13
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Who should take this course

The intended audience or attendee profile is anybody who is considering making the jump to OpenBSD 5.6. You may be considering moving your systems wholly or partly to the new release from an earlier OpenBSD release or to move specific parts of your operation from a different Unix-like operating system to OpenBSD.To help make the session more targeted to your specific interests and needs, I would appreciate if, when you sign up for the session or soon after, send me an email to transition@bsdly.net with a brief description of what you would like to learn in this session, and to the extent you are allowed and feel it is appropriate, what your near or longer term future OpenBSD project is.

Description:

OpenBSD has been the source of a number of BSD innovations over the years, including but not limited to PF (the OpenBSD packet filter, now including a new traffic shaping engine), significantly improved IPSEC tools, OpenSSH (the free Secure Shell server and client), security enhancements including preemtive exploit mitigation, and various other advances of the art and engineering in various parts of the system.At the time of writing (early May 2014) the big news items for OpenBSD 5.6 seem to be the removal of the legacy ALTQ traffic shaping system after a one release grace period (the new traffic shaping system is now the only option), OpenSMTPD as the default mail transfer agent, the debut of the LibreSSL library as an in-tree developed project, the removal of BIND as the default DNS server in favor of nsd and unbound, plus switching the base httpd to nginx (retiring the forked apache 1.3), but itâ€™s not set in stone yet and every release has enhancements that may not be immediately obvious until you start using the system.This session intends to help you tackle the transition to the newest OpenBSD release, highlighting enhancements in the new release and how to avoid any pitfalls that may turn up during the process.

Speaker biography:

Peter N. M. Hansteen is a consultant, writer and sysadmin based in Bergen, Norway. He has been tinkering with computers since the mid 1980s, mainly while working to document how the systems work and why they donâ€™t, in English as well as his native Norwegian. Peter rediscovered Unixes about the time 386BSD appeared. After a few years on Linux, which included participation in the RFC1149 implementation (2001), he eventually migrated all important systems in his care to FreeBSD and OpenBSD.A long time freenix advocate, he is a member of the BLUG (Bergen (BSD and) Linux User Group) core group and a former vice president of NUUG (the Norwegian Unix User Group). During recent years a frequent lecturer and tutor with emphasis on OpenBSD and FreeBSD topics, author of several articles and The Book of PF (3rd edition No Starch Press 2011) and maintains his blogosphere presence at http://bsdly.blogspot.com.

better okay same again anyway you will

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,150
learn to appreciate that the you were

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,519
let's call this question here set up a

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,859
user do you want to disable this is HD

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:34,680
root logins and of course it defaults to

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:36,030
yes and we're all good and well there's

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,399
a magic trick here and that actually

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:45,210
managed to figure out that we're in

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:47,579
Europe and Sophia next up thank you

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,640
whatever your root disk is if you have

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:54,840
several disks it will find them you may

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,370
have to muck around with fdisk at some

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:03,239
point if you have several disks to start

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:05,850
with this is a very simple one one tip

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,890
here you could you can choose here what

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,229
they want disk you IDs which are

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,750
Fairless for along Springs unique

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,820
identifiers for your disks which also

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,299
becomes part of the partition name for

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:22,170
your your Efes tab you want this but you

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:28,040
can still choose no here and and go with

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,040
the old-fashioned wd0 way and so forth

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,700
which of course risks that whenever you

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,890
put another disk in well the numbering

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,880
might change and you don't want that you

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,740
really really want the DUI DS next

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,530
question here is well where it gets

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,689
scary at least where if your multi

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,500
booting do you use the whole disk or

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:57,060
edit the MBR you could edit the MBR that

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,299
drops you into the death disk let's

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,369
steal the disk in this virtual machine

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:08,039
so we'll skip the MBR editing but let's

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,369
have a look it looks like this what we

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,369
could do here

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:19,440
basically we have four petitions and you

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:23,970
if this was not your boot disk you would

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:28,410
want to zero out the three three nonzero

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:31,530
ones but we do not want this and we used

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:35,250
the whole desk and it comes up with a

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,500
default partitioning Straczynski now if

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,810
you notice the mount points you have a

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,340
small partition you have something like

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:47,850
temp where you will not wear the mount

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:52,320
options will include no executes no

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:56,160
device and so forth and it tries to make

00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:00,330
a sensible choice for how much space you

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,050
actually want to use and fairly well

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:08,600
actually fairly minimal amounts of space

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:12,360
and whatever is left over after the

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:17,150
after reasonable amount of space for

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,590
your for your system it's automatically

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,060
suggested to them to go to your home

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,470
partition which is where does the course

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,630
for you or your own directories will be

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,470
created you can play with this you can

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,950
go ahead and that it's done again just

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,000
to demonstrate that we can a an obesity

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,260
install these almost all pressing enter

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,299
maybe just go for the automatic layout

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,299
and now it creates the file systems

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,690
and we go to finally we're starting

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,690
reeling syllable to evil assets' now

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,310
here you could if you have have your

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,660
sets in a different location you can you

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,669
can unistall off the a local hard disk

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,960
well on a new install let probably isn't

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:31,110
an option but for upgrading whenever I

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,510
I myself tend to go snap snap shut it

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,960
snapshot and I just downloaded sets boot

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,180
off the bc rd yeah install from local

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,130
disk and in just works we can welcome

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,740
through that later but here we go from

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:52,229
the CD set that's the default for know

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:55,530
the path on the CD and this is where we

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,930
it makes it an intelligent choice here

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,870
that too

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,669
well since the default qmu virtual

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,870
machine is not a multiprocessor machine

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:10,370
it does not want to turn to install the

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:15,389
bsd MP which is multiprocessor kernel

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:19,500
the rest of the sets the rest of our

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:23,700
services at once you will notice all

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,200
this is actually slightly past 5-6 but

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,460
you will notice that there is no add

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,720
sets here

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:35,220
there's only exits and we'll get back to

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,620
that but anyway we go install yes you

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,479
will perhaps have this problem the

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,330
directory does not come main and contain

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,780
the signature continue without

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:49,410
verification on a new install hopefully

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:53,360
you have you verified your your sets

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:56,360
anyway so we can just go ahead and

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,360
install

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:23,450
though this will take a come on qmu that

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,450
unfortunately is not a high performance

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,450
solution

00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:42,129
there was some talk about open beastie &

00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:43,479
beehive I don't know if anybody I don't

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:50,039
think anybody's working on that at the

00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:50,039
moment but yeah

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:14,389
anyway from here on you know it's the

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:18,380
installing of beastie you can safely go

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:22,520
over the the defaults basically enter

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:25,220
and reenter through your through our

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,790
install and after this you will need to

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:40,180
type reboot and you'll be putting into

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:40,180
the system we can take a peek round yes

00:07:46,330 --> 00:08:00,830
yes be flash boys what you could do that

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:03,380
um I think I need as long as the

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:22,940
whatever you put on your your flash

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:24,260
drive this has been verified okay um you

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,740
could put it in that case you could

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,880
probably do there and all right now it

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,110
sounds like in that environment that's

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,390
very really the right for an auto

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,099
install you know it's just never risk

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,640
your response file we're ready and uh

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,200
yeah which we could we could say could

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,190
take a peek at that and while this

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:49,089
completes that's in the other

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:49,089
presentation we can

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:36,740
yeah well for the fee auto-install you

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:41,420
have something like we would do is put

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:44,290
up a in yard httpd.conf on the well

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:50,810
assuming you already have a working OBC

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:52,700
or working server here basically would

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,760
he put in here of course the ethernet

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,400
address of the thing the the IP address

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,820
is supposed to have a file name with

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:09,110
visits auto install it will do the

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:12,020
install sequence if it's auto upgrade it

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,870
will do an upgrade only on existing

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,690
system and you would have a response

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:21,350
file like something ok your system post

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:26,330
name password which is the encrypted

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:28,490
version of the password and well

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:37,400
basically your questions and the

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:47,060
matching answers and I think we can

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:48,980
actually run that demo here you know our

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,970
our regular installed has almost

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,970
finished

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:36,400
yes this what this is what a Anna I know

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:40,510
install it looks like all they say this

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:44,470
isn't before so it's actually this is

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:46,990
actually cheating I saw mother mother

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:52,080
there might be some some small

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:58,720
differences basically this is the boot

00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:01,120
and pretty soon when you will see the

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:06,120
automatic okay his it waits for a few

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:09,250
seconds for whether you you choose to

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,450
you know so I think the timeout is yeah

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:16,090
Thomas five seconds for and it just

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:18,310
retrieve see the information and it goes

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,800
through all the partitioning and so

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:25,600
forth and really a really high tempo

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:28,320
here and we have here here in contrast

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,630
to what we had earlier this one has the

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:39,640
signature file it actually starts by

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:41,370
verifying the sets and the first person

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,370
visit for a verification like step is

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,370
installation

00:12:52,900 --> 00:13:00,290
yeah I managed to put that anis also a

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:04,430
part of it is probably because the disk

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,190
was fairly small so there's a there's

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:10,520
limitary I forget which little earnest

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:14,990
but if the disk is really small

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:19,240
it won't offer that 11 partitions it

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,240
won't just okay go route swap whatever

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:33,880
so well I think in you should be able to

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:57,330
well in I think you probably should be

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:59,430
able to specify I forget the details

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:04,680
sorry but yeah you should be able to

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:07,170
specify a did we stop something no okay

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,340
it's just it takes a little time and of

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:16,260
course because this went by the default

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:20,930
default choice of sets so we get even

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,930
the the games like stuff like PC Tetris

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:43,980
come this will conclude as you know this

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:51,890
is almost done anyway it will much like

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:51,890
the one in the background here well yes

00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:02,430
what this will do who say we it saves

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:04,080
the comic configuration files and as we

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:11,330
notice in the background here this one

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:17,250
is there's also also boots into the

00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:19,080
installed system so and basically if you

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,800
have a number of number systems you want

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:25,220
to install automatically this way and

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,220
you do it

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,710
now if we'd return to yes there's a

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:43,320
pretty manual install well it's this is

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:48,930
where it's where it stops where you

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:53,390
actually need to enter reboot and we

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,390
will have a version 5.6 system

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:13,980
yeah and the oh install this apparently

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:21,000
on repeat in the background I think

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:23,970
we'll just kill my now this is what a

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,080
regular booth look like looks like

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,080
[Music]

00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,210
yeah anything only things like PF is

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,820
enabled P if P is actually enabled

00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,240
before the network yeah I think it's

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,240
configured

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:06,339
which is one thing that well free BCE

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,069
users will perhaps find a little strange

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,990
but what happened is is 1pf is enabled

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,480
for the zero stage it also loads a

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,029
default rule set that will be in place

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,089
in case you up your your real PF

00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:21,089
calm so you can log in and fix things so

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:30,309
and yeah well you can see the mall

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:32,760
generates the house keys this is the

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,760
first boots

00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:04,020
yeah actually a currents about it day

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:09,990
after it was cut but I I overslept that

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:14,310
day or something oh the the binary is

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:16,440
cells called the same but it's in five

00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,240
five six it is libris a cell but you

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:26,220
know the pilot the filenames didn't

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:34,080
change now back when I started using

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:38,220
open beasty I was I was really impressed

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:41,130
by how our tighter system was like

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:45,150
little ads when I and everything had a

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:47,970
man page and so forth what happens in an

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:51,480
open beasties five six is that it's it's

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:55,050
actually a lot smaller what what

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,130
happened is that a lot of the config

00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:04,980
files it used to be here for non default

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:08,430
services when birds simply moved to its

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:12,360
examples so if you happen to write let's

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:14,610
have a look at examples if you if you

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,890
don't run a BGP you don't you don't want

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,230
BGP dot-com anyway but you have an

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,780
example here please we can start by

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,450
copying that back and editing and so

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,450
forth or you can just be the

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:30,780
documentation so basically your system

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:34,110
got a lot less messy know even less

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:39,270
messy beastie five out six perjury

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:41,910
earlier now on a on an upgrade you might

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:44,550
see if what if things lying around

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:48,950
anyway but now at least you know you can

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:52,740
remove them stuff you don't and I

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:56,940
suspect when the actual release happens

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,310
there will be documentation on the web

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,910
on

00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:09,540
exactly which files to remove if you're

00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:14,640
going for a pristine system now this is

00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:19,110
that's for a clean install if we're

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:25,200
interested we could go for an upgrade

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:28,820
from some earlier version or well or I

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,820
could start listening to your questions

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:38,160
the again the formula this session is

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,920
yeah let's start and start demo here yes

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,410
one thing I did not mention is that the

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,940
Installer it used to be that Network

00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:50,760
installs could be you have to pee or

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:58,920
HTTP uh for various reasons we are

00:20:50,760 --> 00:21:02,460
dropping HTTP works just well and we do

00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:05,010
have a very nice FTP proxy for PF

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,830
firewalls but you can't really rely on

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:09,270
that being in place so HTTP general it

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,130
works and if you're running a mirror

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:15,560
well this one the last thing you need to

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:19,500
worry about so that's starting with five

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:26,400
five six we only have R actually that

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:31,230
was my fight so for anyone coming from

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:34,800
the Linux world beastie well basically

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:37,860
there are not a lot of well there are

00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,520
fewer knobs to to twiddle and obesity

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,870
than in several other operating systems

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:48,140
well once you do twelve little you put

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:52,440
in your RCL local because our sitcom is

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:56,000
its defaults file so if you look at the

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,000
pristine system here

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:14,190
where's a cop local is well all of 12

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:17,280
bytes man is slow

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:20,100
and that's well basically it says we

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:31,740
unable to ntpd and it has no flag so it

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:33,660
just runs with a default you would nice

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,640
to calm our second as I said I'm open

00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:39,390
beastie is the defaults much like free

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,390
beasties as defaults are sitcom same

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,560
thing only we we are a convention as you

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,050
Paul

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:50,490
well it's that ammunition did not used

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:52,230
to be that that's strict but well I

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,890
people have been known to hit this and

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,660
this is a really bad idea because this

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,170
font will be overwritten next time you

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:05,100
upgrade comes out of the base sets or it

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:09,780
used to be the es sets so this is the

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,620
format and this is now a really simple

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,920
file either

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:18,020
there are basically three things you

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:23,190
could do each setting you can disable

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:25,860
disable stuff with no anything does not

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,460
know including well if it's if it's

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:31,490
empty its enable enable a demon but run

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,410
with them whatever defaults or

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:37,920
alternatively you can put a set of flags

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:41,400
and quotes here so much the same as on

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:46,200
the FreeBSD but you cannot put commands

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:51,420
scripts here that would be for your RC

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,280
comm some local no RC RC local nice if

00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,820
account local is basically just an

00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:03,690
extension of where I actually overrides

00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:06,240
our sitcom and again I one thing we do

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,330
not put in the you know in contrast with

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,270
with FreeBSD would it up put the network

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:14,310
interface configuration in in our

00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:17,340
silicon if it actually goes in host name

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:22,350
does not interface name files much like

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:24,630
your traditional iris nephew others and

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,360
of course well anything you put in your

00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:31,710
ads directory for sub directories

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:34,950
as you want them config files for our

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,870
various demons and a really important

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,650
here Errol an open BC everything has a

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,179
man page

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,780
everything has man patient usually

00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,980
usually that's readable so well if you

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,510
were a little braver

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:52,670
we're just dive into the man pages and

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:56,010
skip my tutorial but anyway so basically

00:24:52,670 --> 00:25:00,770
something yeah one thing is good to know

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:06,809
is we have a specific setting package

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:10,850
scripts packages are anything installed

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:12,750
by the package system or our demons no

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:16,290
installed by the package system

00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:20,970
generally are started by a some script

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:24,440
and that's our CD named semo's demon so

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,330
and the ones you want to start

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:32,790
automatically on on boot you put in the

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:37,500
package scripts arrival and here is for

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:40,500
a mail server I am running it starts XM

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,890
because I do not like sent mail and open

00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,480
as MDPD wasn't quite ready yet

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:48,299
sparrows hasn't clam de fresh clam and

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,100
grace canner grace Conner is a program

00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:54,150
that runs in tandem with the open

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,429
beastie spam D if you don't if you

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,900
haven't sample spam D yet well any

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:05,250
running in the mail server you're really

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:08,780
missing out and yeah for your local you

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:12,299
can actually are see a lot local exists

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:15,260
if you have stuff that doesn't fit in

00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:19,490
the middle market you need more modern

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,490
version of how to do things

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:31,380
um yes things are good to know is that

00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:35,150
the bass demons are generally proposed

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:42,780
separated so and someone on the chroot

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:46,380
so that well the practical upshot of

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:50,610
this is that your that's password and

00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:56,700
that's groups this group file on a

00:26:50,610 --> 00:27:04,580
typical open beastie system is a little

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:07,230
more crowded then you you have these

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:11,370
basically everything runs as long as its

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:13,200
own user with a specific set of

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:16,799
permissions and usually a home directory

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,110
that's not really usable and most of

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,789
them will not have a well Muslim it

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:26,909
would have a non-interactive shell and

00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:32,100
small so yeah let's that's me at the

00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:36,350
bottom there which is you know bending

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:40,770
the traditional unix unix permissions

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:45,690
system to do your well even even without

00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:48,120
the what I call it role based you know

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,940
this is as close to role based access

00:27:48,120 --> 00:28:01,500
control as you get using using UNIX

00:27:50,940 --> 00:28:04,620
permissions so and well one thing that's

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,510
important to remember is well well one

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:10,610
things that always trips up Linux users

00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:15,809
coming to vez de bin bin SH is not bash

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:22,110
on obesity it's the postman Bourne shell

00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:25,710
and the one thing that will get you

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:28,799
around the ridiculed and open beast in

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:31,920
misc is changing routes shell - don't do

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:36,540
that don't do that because well

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:39,510
some wool system scripts have not been

00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,550
extensively tested using - so well

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:46,590
though it's it's likely things will

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:48,690
break and of course for your basic

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,700
environment you want manager if you want

00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,700
to excellent raise one we have the real

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,980
VI and we have mg which is a strange

00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:02,550
animal let's a I'm a gimmicks clone

00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:06,840
that's just manager I grew up with Emacs

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:10,830
will be quite happy with mg but you know

00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:16,350
it's just an editor or not that not that

00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:17,880
big monster but new Emacs is available

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,620
through a package system if you want

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:26,600
that if you want to write read email

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:26,600
with your edit text editor you can yes

00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:47,290
yes our our look at wasn't for you yes

00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:51,280
unfortunately and unfortunately Cala

00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:52,920
support is has been a most disturbed

00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,530
working progress for quite a while

00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:00,670
playing at once your annex that's it's

00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:09,040
generally generally better burgers they

00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:12,430
can care of so but yes on the even no

00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,650
agents like like myself we do not this

00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:17,410
is supposed to be no slash and this is a

00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:20,530
II actually the a year late ligature

00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:23,530
actually becomes a on the shell here so

00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:30,180
that that is a remaining problem so

00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:30,180
basically utf-8 is not told an yet it's

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:39,820
it's been a set of working produce for

00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,600
quite a while it's possible that work

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:48,700
has stopped and might be restarted if

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:53,710
somebody steps up its thing is with look

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:56,250
at Unicode support it it's a fairly

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:59,350
large set of code that needs to be

00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:04,350
verified to actually work so it's a lot

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:07,270
of work involved and in polluting the

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:11,650
like it has been referred to as

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:13,860
polluting the base systems was question

00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,860
over here

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:27,810
now once you've once you've installed

00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:32,230
your 5.6 release well there is already a

00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:37,680
patch for OpenBSD 5.6 yes wondering why

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:43,500
the bill - paid fix for several popular

00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:46,930
network adapters this one oh the

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:51,960
recommended way to do to go is really

00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:55,990
not what I tend to do when I want to run

00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,860
stable systems is maintain a stable

00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:08,170
check out of the check out of the stable

00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:11,610
source tree it is basically pick you the

00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:14,830
mirror nearest to you network wise

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:19,600
you'll you'll find a client list of

00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:26,740
mirrors via this you know by the add-on

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:30,280
CVS page on obesity rhetoric for money

00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,450
for most people in Europe the EU the

00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,570
humor will work

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,280
this one says CA because well the

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:40,420
previous presentation was given in

00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:49,920
Canada and a good thing here is that if

00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:52,840
you check out a the the the stable tree

00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,570
you probably will notice that same files

00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,210
that are referenced in the the patch

00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,800
file in the errata well yeah well it

00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,200
will be much changed when you do the

00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,790
check out but you can oh we should do

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:10,450
anyway is when when there is a an errata

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:12,850
out I fetched a file anyway over just at

00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:16,750
least look at it and you can go for me

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:19,710
this is basically a diff and it's also

00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,710
got the

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,460
now it looks like the signature here is

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,910
a separate file but anyway you go by the

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:40,929
whatever says on top of the top off the

00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:44,950
end of the patch so here's the flighty

00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:48,340
of the patch and you actually put a

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:51,160
flying patch by running a sign if I

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,740
command that verifies that Apache is

00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:59,200
there's real one and then runs runs

00:33:53,740 --> 00:34:01,720
patch and using the using national patch

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,910
here you can fairly easily eyeball

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,630
whether to you well the year L and files

00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:11,260
have been changed and again go and build

00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:14,740
your kernel and then again if you

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:18,310
maintain a lot of systems you might want

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:20,730
to actually build local releases and

00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:25,419
it's a little more involved but the

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:29,500
release the man release page is actually

00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:37,030
quite complete another thing if you want

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:41,590
to if on more literature on the current

00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:44,800
feeding of open beastie Michael Lucas is

00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:47,200
absolute obesity second edition it is a

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,869
really good book about open beastie it's

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,730
not a couple of versions old so it

00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:55,780
doesn't he doesn't have sign if I for

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:58,570
example and the and the PF part is

00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,780
missing the new queuing system but you

00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:08,740
know the book is really worth worth

00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:13,150
getting are we are they setting up

00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:17,859
coffee out there yes okay so maybe we

00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:21,990
should break for coffee and I'll promise

00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:21,990
