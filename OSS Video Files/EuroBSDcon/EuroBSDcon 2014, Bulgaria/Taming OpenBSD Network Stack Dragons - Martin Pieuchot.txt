Description: 
	Abstract:

After more than 30 years of evolution, the network stack used in OpenBSD still carries a lot from its original architecture.The ongoing work to make it process network packets on multiple cores, led us to reconsider some parts if this architecture after understanding how its data structures and interfaces were really used.This talk describes some of the non obvious internals of OpenBSDâ€™s network stack, the dragons, and the work that has been done in order to tame them.

Speaker biography:

Martin Pieuchot is an OpenBSD developer and a R&D engineer working for Compumatica secure networks, a Dutch/German networking appliance manufacturer.
