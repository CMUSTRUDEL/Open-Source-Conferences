Title: Snapshots, replication and boot environments - Kris Moore
Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

In early 2013 the PC-BSD project decided to re-focus and fully embrace ZFS as its default and only file-system for both desktop and server deployments. This decision immediately spawned development of a new class of tools and utilities which assist users in unlocking the vast potential that ZFS brings to their system. In this talk we will take a look at ZFS Boot-Environments and the new Life-Preserver utility which assists users in ZFS management, including snapshots, replication, mirroring, bare-metal restores and more.
