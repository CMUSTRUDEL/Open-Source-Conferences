Title: Cross Building the FreeBSD ports tree - Baptiste Daroussin
Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

Building packages is a resource consuming task and can take very long on embedded devices or low power architectures. Being able to use the power of amd64 servers to build packages for arm or mips allows to make this task faster and less tedious.

This talk will cover the following topics:

- State of art to build arm/mips packages on FreeBSD from a powerful amd64 box
- How to create a cross building environement
- How the ports tree does automatically handle cross building
- How dependencies are handled when cross building packages
- How to workaround non cross buildable or broken build system like perl and python
- Cross build monster ports: chromium, libreoffice, openjdk and firefox
- What are the current limitation
- Future directions for the cross building framework in the ports tree
