Title: Keynote - FreeBSD: looking forward to another 10 years - Jordan Hubbard
Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

The FreeBSD project is now over 20 years old, and the Berkeley Software Distribution from which it originated is almost 40! The last 10 years have seen some fairly radical changes in the mobile and embedded computing markets, with the number of FreeBSD-based appliances also on the rise. What this means for FreeBSD, and what the project can learn from the various members of the Fortune 500 who have put BSD technology to good use, will be the topic of this presentation.

Speaker biography:

Jordan Hubbard is a long-time open source developer, authoring software such as the Ardent Window Manager and various other open source tools and libraries before co-founding the FreeBSD project with Nate Williams and Rodney W. Grimes in 1993, for which he contributed the initial FreeBSD Ports collection, package management system and sysinstall. In July 2001 Hubbard joined Apple Computer in the role of manager of the BSD technology group. On July 15, 2013, he became CTO of iXsystems.

bulgarian company my employer actually

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,520
the netbsd foundation

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,550
so a couple of quick announcements

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,099
before we start with the keynote the

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,890
social event will be tonight at Sophia

hotel Balcom and will start at 7:30 p.m.

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:42,390
also we had to make a few couple a few

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,120
last-minute program changes there will

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,030
be no freebsd dev summit reports but we

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,100
have three new stocks on the schedule

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,819
this afternoon and those are the talks

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,150
there will be on the website in 15

00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,150
minutes

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,330
and of course your live streaming the

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,600
event and those are the links to the web

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,880
streams

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,620
ok so enjoy the conference and I now

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,580
give you Jordan Hubbard who will give

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,580
the first you know

00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,879
you

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,830
hi I'm Jordan Hubbard I am currently the

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,160
CTO of iock systems one of the sponsors

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,670
of this conference and obviously FreeBSD

00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,870
and I go back a long ways in fact I

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,730
probably should have called this talk

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,280
looking forward to another 20 years to

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,320
be symmetrical but I can't see more than

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,450
10 years ahead and in 20 years I plan to

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:48,970
be dead so so I'm gonna talk a little

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,230
bit about the future and the title of my

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,790
talk is a little bit of a double

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,440
entendre right I am looking forward to

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,870
another 10 years I think there's some

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,320
great things ahead of us but I'm also

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:02,290
going to try to make some suggestions

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:06,690
and and and points about what we need to

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:08,770
do to be relevant in 10 more years so

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,620
I'm going to predict that I can't win

00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,120
this either way because if you disagree

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,170
with me you will say that things don't

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,090
work this way in the open-source

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,010
community it's a big hobby and we do

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,540
what we want and if you agree with me

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,980
you'll say things don't work this way in

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,500
the open-source community and we do

00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,970
whatever the heck we want but I hope to

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,660
change your mind a little bit about that

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,100
because I think for many of us here

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,900
especially myself but certainly not

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,290
limited to myself this is not a hobby

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,570
anymore this has become more than that

00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,430
and we have we have achieved more than

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,290
than what you would achieve with the

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,230
mere hobby and I think we're we're

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,180
certainly all in personal positions

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,700
where FreeBSD is a lot more relevant to

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:53,590
our daily lives so but let me first look

00:04:51,700 --> 00:05:00,010
at let us first look at where we came

00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:01,720
from so freebsd 1.0 November 1st or

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:07,510
November 2nd depending on what time zone

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:10,570
you're in 1993 just over 20 years ago I

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,770
did the first as the release engineer

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:16,570
but obviously we're working with many

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:20,770
people 1.0 release of FreeBSD and this

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:24,190
was our this is our 20th anniversary so

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,900
we're almost 21 years old now and as I

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,680
said we can we can drink legally in the

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,970
US and just

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,590
couple more months yes well we'll touch

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,740
more on the drinking theme in a little

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:40,949
bit so this was our first distribution

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:44,530
media okay I'm lying just a little bit

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,729
but not by much this was our first

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,160
distribution media

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:52,470
I remember installing FreeBSD a number

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,430
of times over a 1.2 megabytes floppy and

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,020
that's of course when I couldn't do it

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,710
over a parallel port because that was

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,639
faster

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:03,729
that was really high-tech and this had

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,199
ramifications which which will kind of

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,289
touch on ramifications throughout this

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,940
talk you'll notice for example that all

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,190
of the files in the bin dist and this

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,940
was true until comparatively recently is

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,590
about just over 230 K and that's because

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,900
that was the size that we could break up

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,669
the media and fit into both a 1.4 4

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,470
megabyte floppy and a 1.2 megabytes

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,660
Lappe so in case you've ever wondered

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,520
why we picked that specific size it

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,970
divided evenly into the installation

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,430
media of the day and BST turns out is

00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,840
full of these little Easter eggs where

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:39,099
you wonder why did they do it like that

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,280
well let me take you 20 25 years back as

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:45,159
Kirk can certainly tell us many stories

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,659
about this was the 1.0 ports collection

00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,659
back when it was manageable

00:06:51,470 --> 00:07:02,789
you can see bashes there so it might

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,800
have been we don't know

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,389
can we scooch the projector over a

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,849
little bit I think we're clipping

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,770
clipping off the left edge I don't know

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:15,000
if that's possible but in any case

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,240
obviously some humble beginnings and

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,919
this was my first build machine that

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,270
actually is not an actual picture of my

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,340
first build machine I don't think I ever

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,669
photographed it but it's pretty much

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,039
what it looked like and it had a

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:33,389
absolutely blistering 50 megahertz Intel

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,190
dx2 processor in it and I paid no

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,139
kidding

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,550
$1600 for the first one gigabyte hard

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,860
drive I remember when they first came

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,750
out and I went and paid cash for it so

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,930
that I could do builds of FreeBSD this

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:52,319
was the first dream laptop many of us

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:56,039
had this is Warner Loesch and I in Japan

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,330
that's me touching of Sony Vaio very

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,039
lustfully because I couldn't actually

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:05,370
afford one at the time but yeah yeah

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:10,409
obviously a little lighter back then and

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:14,339
we'll touch on that too so and this was

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:19,740
our very first conference as you can see

00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:22,979
not much has changed and it's Kirk

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,810
hoisting a pitcher of beer and as David

00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,199
O'Brien in the background bringing two

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,180
more pitchers of beer to the to the

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,899
podium at the Radisson I think this was

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,310
you giving your BSD Talk where you yeah

00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,019
and you got progressively more

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,149
inebriated as the talk went on but you

00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,740
remain remarkably lucid I think we

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:44,850
actually understood you for pretty much

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:49,010
99% of that talk but this was at the

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:51,180
Radisson Hotel in Berkeley and it was

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,310
it's really interesting just think about

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,670
how humble our beginnings were I mean

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:59,130
the first morning the the water lines of

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,600
the hotel was cut so nobody could take a

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,510
shower and everybody showed up with

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,019
their hair all plastered to their heads

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,880
looking and smelling not great and but

00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:13,220
we had a great time and we managed to

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,510
pull it off and here we are more than 20

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,500
years later still having these

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,449
conferences and having them

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,860
internationally so I think that's really

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:24,279
awesome so the other thing that has

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,079
certainly changed is that 20 years ago

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,420
our targets in the commercial space and

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:32,899
we did want to be relevant and have have

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:37,190
commercial users where ISPs pretty much

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:40,940
that was at least 90% of FreeBSD x' user

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,579
base we also did a lot of small and home

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,709
office web servers and routers people

00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,120
got a 386 out of the closet with a

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:50,410
couple of Ethernet ports and made a

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,000
router out of it very do it yourself

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,519
remember from all the traffic on

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,060
questions and if we had any any major

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,980
companies at all

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,800
that was Yahoo which remains to this day

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:08,230
a free beastie shop and hotmail which

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,149
does not we also obviously were were

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,089
used on a lot of basic developer desktop

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:16,370
machines you know x11 plus 50 terminal

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,889
windows was considered an acceptable

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,980
developer desktop again not much has

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:25,160
changed and the majority of FreeBSD

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,949
machines were physical pcs that ran on

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,560
AC power and that may seem like a pretty

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:32,389
obvious statement to make but again this

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,620
is something that we'll come back to

00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:38,779
later because things have changed and

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,269
the key takeaway from this slide is that

00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:44,089
free beasties role in the world was

00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:45,980
pretty overt the the brand meant

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,139
something when he talked about freebsd

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,360
at least in the network services

00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:53,510
community and whatnot it had a had a

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,639
certain cachet and there was there was a

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,220
certain brand value around it and

00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:02,630
everyone was very upfront about using

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:07,430
freebsd so here we are 20 years later

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:10,300
that's a 64 gigabyte USB thumb drive 64

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:13,730
times larger than the hard drive I spent

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,550
$1,600 for and now most of you have one

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,329
from your keychains and probably got it

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:22,579
free at some conference as a giveaway it

00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:24,589
just amazes me and you know what you can

00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:25,339
obviously put on one is it's just

00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,949
astounding

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:30,350
we don't actually put much more than cat

00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:32,449
pictures and and smallest elation images

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:37,610
on them but we could do a lot more with

00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:40,190
these and this little $35 device I

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,510
rounded up to 50 because you have won an

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:45,470
SD card obviously has more power by

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:50,060
probably almost an order of magnitude

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:52,610
than my first for 860 X 2 so that is a

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:57,160
game changer and it also means that it's

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,930
entirely different part of the world can

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,029
can do this now right this is something

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,910
you can sell into into much poorer

00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:08,510
countries I paid a lot of money for my

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:12,230
first PC again many orders of magnitude

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,610
more than $35 and the fact that you can

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,709
now do meaningful development on

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,500
something like that is again it's it's a

00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:19,940
game changer

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,130
and obviously my dream laptop has

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,740
evolved somewhat as well I don't have to

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:28,130
stroke it anymore I do own one and again

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:32,449
this machine has far more power almost a

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:34,880
terabyte of flash storage huge display

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:37,100
density very powerful multi-core

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,310
processor is just you know like I can

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:43,160
run 5 or 6 instances of FreeBSD under

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,010
virtualization faster than I could ever

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,690
have run it on a physical machine before

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,360
where Sony Vaio just fell by the wayside

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,350
somewhere and the other thing I want to

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,959
point out which i think is pretty

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,949
relevant is that this has BSD included

00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:59,839
you may not consider OS tend to be BSD

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:02,360
in the in the most classic sense of the

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,310
word but there's a lot of BSD in there

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,980
and more importantly there's Unix in

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,480
there and when we bought our Sony Vaio's

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,790
way back when when we could finally

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,180
afford them you basically got Windows on

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,160
it and our OS 2 if it was that long ago

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,370
and that would those were your only

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,139
choices and you had to to rip off some

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,730
other operating system to get a UNIX

00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,850
desktop so the fact that we actually

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,880
have a UNIX desktop this many decades

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,070
after Microsoft

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,380
their very very best to kill eunuchs

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:36,300
dead I think says a lot about the the

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:38,430
staying power of eunuchs so obviously

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,920
the current release version is 10-point

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:46,020
Oh working on 10.1 is sepia bleed we

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:48,150
speak there now 24,000 ports somebody

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,080
asked me if I had known then what I know

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,760
now if I would have done it there are

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,110
hundreds of committers from both act I'm

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,570
not going to answer that question there

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,520
are hundreds of committers and a lot

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,830
more we still have a lot of strong

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,540
showing in academia but as I mentioned

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,520
earlier a lot more of us during the

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,280
commercial world a lot of us have

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,940
actually been paid to come here and

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,710
that's a very interesting and very

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,670
telling development that again we've

00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:20,010
grown up we also for the first time have

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,830
long term sources of funding the FreeBSD

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,910
Foundation broke a million in donations

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:29,760
last year that's that's that's real

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,350
money now and it's not they're not just

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,180
standing by themselves there are there

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,700
were a lot of sponsors we saw on that

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,470
slide a minute ago and a lot of people

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,540
putting putting real sums of money into

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,820
FreeBSD and sponsoring the development

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,470
of it which i think is a really great

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,000
thing because there are there's always

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,190
going to be a category of really

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,800
annoying things that nobody really wants

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,140
to do that much for free or just in

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,240
their spare time and so the the funding

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,240
makes tackling those sorts of challenges

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,280
possible but what's also interesting is

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,810
that the markets have really changed you

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,100
know we're not aiming at where we were

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,070
twenty years ago or at least we should

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:09,720
not be and one of the things that's

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:13,680
really changed is that the GPL has gone

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:17,130
to Version three and it has created a

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,640
renaissance in interest in the BSD

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,200
license in the commercial space I use

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,580
that particular animation because I

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,500
really you know you think of kangaroos

00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,450
is nice cuddly animals and then one

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,340
kicks you into the water which is how a

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,660
lot of people felt when in the

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,810
commercial world when they follow the

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,880
GPL bandwagon and then suddenly v3 came

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,280
out and as of technologies that they

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,800
were reliant on went v3 and there was a

00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,779
whole bunch of new scary

00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,290
is a security language in there that

00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:47,060
most lawyers scares the crap out of most

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,110
lawyers I mean I've been in a lot of

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,790
meetings with a lot of lawyers were

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,990
there going in line by line through this

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:57,410
thing and going take it out so that's

00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:01,550
actually helped us quite a bit in roles

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,410
that I'll touch more on in a minute so

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,290
one of the areas in which it's helped us

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,660
is that you're seeing FreeBSD and other

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,290
variants of BSD or pieces of BSD

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,589
technology being used in a lot of

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:18,620
appliances routers load balancers

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:21,470
security appliances monitors file

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,180
servers obviously and it's also the

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,620
basis for a lot of software appliances

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,110
which you can put on more generic

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,339
Hardware obviously I work on free ads so

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,050
I had to put it on there but it's by no

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,880
means the only one and if you look at

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,230
the commercial page at the FreeBSD web

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,320
site you'll see a bunch of different

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,240
things there and as I was surprised to

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,300
see last year it's even the base OS for

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,320
a popular gaming console so what's

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,940
really becoming more evident than

00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,089
anything else though is that what we

00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:52,120
used to consider the embedded market was

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:54,260
engine computers in cars and and

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,709
avionics computers things that were

00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:00,649
really really small and special-purpose

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:03,050
had very limited capabilities not much

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,990
memory and some sort of our toss that

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,319
ran on them but that is really changing

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,270
overnight and if there's a key takeaway

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,870
to kind of set against my previous

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,360
takeaway

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,870
it's that FreeBSD is now becoming much

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:22,480
more covert in its usage people rebrand

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:24,380
it right juniper calls it - Juno's the

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,210
company whose name I can't remember

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:31,910
right now up in Seattle calls it a 1 FS

00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,929
EMC and then their subsidiary again if

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,460
you look at the website there are

00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:37,370
probably a dozen different names for

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,080
FreeBSD now people just I don't even

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,400
know what Sony calls their operating

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,230
system they probably don't even refer to

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,740
it it's just the operating system that

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:49,669
runs in the PlayStation 4 what's that

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:53,659
orbit okay well there you go interesting

00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:55,070
name but it's not called FreeBSD and you

00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:57,950
know is is that a bad thing

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,990
not really what it is is it just says

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,899
that FreeBSD has reached a certain

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,480
commodity value that it's useful as a

00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:07,520
brand name to know what technology with

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,320
where the technology source is but you

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,460
don't have to call your product FreeBSD

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,559
in fact you probably don't want to

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,820
because it you're gonna you're gonna do

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,830
different branding exercises around

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,840
whatever your product is if your

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,610
security appliance you're gonna try and

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,649
put the word security in there somewhere

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:27,380
if you're a gaming company I guess space

00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:29,029
or you know and so again that's that's a

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,980
very interesting development for me at

00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,230
least because it really does mean we've

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,830
reached the CIM the OS commoditization

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:39,500
era where FreeBSD is a brand is both

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,970
meaningful and not meaningful and in

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,230
fact I've had a lot of arguments with

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,460
people where they've said well you

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,220
really need to change the name of it

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,820
because FreeBSD what is that a free has

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,340
weird connotations and BSD well that was

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,070
25 years ago at some obscure place in

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,220
California and my rebuttal is always it

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,620
doesn't matter it's just just a brand

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,590
right when when when we came up with the

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,000
iPad at Apple there were a lot of people

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,000
talking about the connotations of that

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,250
word nobody thinks about it anymore

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,049
it is just a brand and FreeBSD has

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,480
reached the same place we don't need to

00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:20,090
change the name it's it's not it's not a

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,919
problem so looking at trends and I just

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,179
grabbed this slide from from Gartner and

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,100
I don't really care for it very much

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:27,049
because it kind of tries to put all of

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,350
us somehow at the iPads doorstep and I

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:32,240
don't think that's perfectly accurate

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,100
obviously mobile devices in general or

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,990
what have caused that curve to happen

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,840
it isn't just Apple releasing the iPad

00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,029
on April 3rd it was probably the the

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,179
match or the the match that lit that the

00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:47,330
Gunpowder but we're really seeing mobile

00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:51,860
devices take over the world and that's

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:53,529
not going to stop and in fact if we look

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,570
at US deployments today by sheer numbers

00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:58,920
or sort of UNIX OS deployments the

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:03,270
phones are obviously the biggest

00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,830
tablets watches that's an artist

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,550
conception by the way I have no idea

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,850
what the actual iWatch looks like and

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:13,470
cables

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:16,110
what UNIX runs in a cable yes as a

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,630
matter of fact it does there are a

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:23,330
number of peripherals out there that do

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:26,190
video transcoding DRM I hate to say

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,710
various tasks that require a pretty

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,260
robust software stack you don't want to

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,120
really take an mpeg-4 decoder or stack

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,030
which is half a million lines of code

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,980
and put it on top of an arc house

00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:39,780
because it turns out that that code was

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,210
written on some sort of UNIX operating

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,400
system and it makes all kinds of system

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,680
calls and relies on a number of

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,750
libraries so as you start kind of

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,880
pulling on that piece of string you very

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,160
quickly find out jeez I need a unix in

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,720
here well it turns out that's not a big

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,190
deal because there's enough space in

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,130
those little connectors to put a tiny

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,690
little arm chip at each end and so one

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:08,850
of the first thing that cable does is

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:11,670
boot and yeah what could go wrong you

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,490
know our cables gonna have heartbleed

00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,830
bug zorina

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:21,390
it's it's an it it's an interesting

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:23,610
question so so yes as I said the

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,980
embedded market is really morphing what

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,780
you think of it as embedded is so

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,910
embedded you don't probably even realize

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,680
it and when we get fully into the

00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,960
internet of things whatever the hell

00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,690
that means you're gonna see even more

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,820
tiny devices that are in these various

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,280
ubiquitous roles that you never imagined

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,660
a UNIX operating system being and but

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,800
people are going to reach for UNIX so

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,200
stick it in there because it's the

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,660
easiest and cheapest thing to do and the

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,640
the hardware's powerful enough all the

00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,440
reasons that that you know restricted

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,350
you from doing it like having only 4k of

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:59,970
memory or a 1-bit processor that is so

00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:01,890
yesterday so you know talking a lot

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,660
about mobile here but obviously the

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,790
enterprise space is kind of the other

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,250
end of the barbell and I think it

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:11,160
deserves its own own chapter so to speak

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,980
and even there it's kind of interesting

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,770
you're

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,600
a lot of pressure at what we considered

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,850
the classic enterprise desktop space

00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,010
with people bringing their own devices

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,480
in that's that's the BYOD movement

00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,880
people talk about and it drives IT

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,410
administrators insane because they have

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,419
to take this huge array of devices that

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,240
people insist and usually people by

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:36,250
people I mean the CEO insists on

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,900
bringing to work and insist on you

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,970
operate interoperating with their

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,220
software and working with Salesforce and

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,690
all the various things and so for about

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,100
three or four years they fought tooth

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,370
and nail against it and finally they

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,720
just gave up and so you're seeing that

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,730
what what is considered sort of the

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,890
classic desktop deployment even in the

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,200
enterprise I remember an era when people

00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,780
like GM and Unilever had ten thousand

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,290
twenty thousand desktops there they're

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,540
going the way of the dodo bird why right

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,549
just take your iPad with you or your

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,820
tablet of whatever flavor you like or

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:11,290
your phablet your large phone and use it

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,520
during the meeting and that's what

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,280
people are doing and they can project

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,630
from it and do a lot of other things the

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,970
other thing that's squeezing it from the

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,919
other end is this whole cloud computing

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,980
thing is becoming a little less nebulous

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,320
and a bit more specific in that if you

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,870
want to do computation and you want to

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,200
do storage and you want to do a certain

00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:35,860
known set of things the the economics of

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,929
off hosting to the cloud and I hate that

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,720
word because it means some so little and

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:43,240
so much is actually becoming pretty

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,980
compelling and plus you're seeing a lot

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,230
of software vendors a lot of is vs

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,480
saying I won't sell you a copy of my

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,650
software any other way I don't want you

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,040
hosting this yourself

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:56,400
we're hosting it in the cloud so you you

00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,950
sign up and you pay your monthly fee and

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,419
pretty soon why do you need anything

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,360
more than a web browser to run the

00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:06,010
software the other thing that's kind of

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,000
interesting too and I've been noticing

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:12,700
this had a older friend of mine even

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,669
older than me say that he just got a job

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,350
at one of those San Francisco startups

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:19,780
that are kind of going under the the

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,890
collective description of two guys with

00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,650
two laptops in the coffee shop

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:28,400
and he was amazed that they were able to

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,990
do an entire offices worth of work from

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,760
their laptops in the coffee shop because

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,080
every time they committed a change to

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,000
the code it fired off this huge

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,040
chef-driven set of automation which

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,530
would spin up machine virtual machines

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:47,900
and Amazon ec2 and start various tools

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,190
running and there do regression tests

00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,560
and a whole bunch of things then some

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,180
more VMs would fire up and it would go

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,670
to a staging server and then they would

00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,200
connect to their little URL for the

00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,970
staging server and they'd look at it and

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,220
say you know click around use it yep

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,780
looks pretty good they took a shipit'

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,030
button and then boom it would go and

00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,770
deploy and during the peak of the

00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,540
automation and they would run a lot of

00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,760
tests I mean this wasn't just a fly by

00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:14,300
the city or past kind of operation they

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,510
probably had 50 or 60 VMs running and so

00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,120
they didn't need a data center they

00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,130
didn't need a dedicated IT guy they just

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,780
they just had somebody who understood

00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:27,260
chef or saltstack or one of those

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,880
automation frameworks and spent a few

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,190
days or maybe a few weeks or a few

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,870
months even spinning up all of the

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,760
automation infrastructure they needed

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,400
and then they were done and they just

00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:44,660
use that so again this has ramifications

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:47,270
which I'll get back to so no one stone

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,160
argues that UNIX is basically Lego right

00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,600
it's it's a bunch of composable pieces

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,270
you can put together in interesting ways

00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,920
and and one of the one of the aspects of

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:57,050
Lego is that it's a great general

00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,060
purpose tool kit and we kind of designed

00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:02,270
UNIX the same way it's very composable

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:06,560
and we see it as this elegant awesome

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:10,310
ass-kicking kind of thing the world sees

00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:12,470
us more like this which is just a pile

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,270
of Lego man we just we're gonna take the

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,550
leg list that we want and please try to

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,860
make them all square and we'll put them

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:21,220
together it's for these automation tasks

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,830
and these sort of mobile and embedded

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,750
development things but of course they're

00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,940
not all square because this is really

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,220
more what it looks like it's a lot of

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,090
square pieces and some very specialized

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,150
pieces that you can

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:40,610
do anything but one thing with so what

00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,860
what's what's hitting us hard in our in

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:47,060
our insufficiently abstracted LEGO

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,650
universe is again the fact that we have

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,570
a we're carrying around a lot of weight

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,510
to support physical hardware that really

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,580
no longer exists in quantity the most

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,890
most I think I don't have any metrics to

00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,660
make up on the spot but I would say that

00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,060
probably the majority of OS deployments

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:05,060
today are virtual if you just counted

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,590
sheer sheer number of seats and of

00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,720
course the devices attached to those are

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,060
also virtual so the quality of your

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,740
virtual device drivers is probably more

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,970
importantly becoming more important than

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,710
the ones for your physical device

00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,920
drivers now there are exceptions of

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:22,700
course ten base yeah

00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,980
a ten gigabit NICs and whatnot or 40

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,720
gigabit or soon 100 gigabit they have

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,550
very specific demands that they place on

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,220
physical hardware so at some point you

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,290
have to run your your copy of ESXi or

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,960
Zen Center or whatever on some physical

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,080
hardware that has to work but everything

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,460
from there on up is virtualized and

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,980
again to talk about the the two guys

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:46,190
with two laptops in San Francisco coffee

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,980
shop scenario well most of what their

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,900
automation tools actually do is to do

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,360
their best to erase the notion of a host

00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,490
personality that to take all the

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,560
configuration information and take it

00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,680
from some other place and splat it on

00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,720
top of a running OS instance so a lot of

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,630
the the beautiful abstractions that

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,970
we've built for for configuring and for

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,820
sort of personalizing a box or even the

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,250
the workflow that we're used to where we

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,690
get a copy of freebsd on a cd-rom or

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,400
thumb drive if we're a little bit more

00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,810
progressive and we install it on a

00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,420
physical machine and we go through all

00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,800
the configuration steps and lovingly

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,670
tailor it to our needs

00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,320
that's dead it really is I mean we do it

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,360
because we're used to it it's really

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,320
really familiar to it I mean we kept

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,330
using system stall for how long so but

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,640
that's not how the rest of the world

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:41,650
wants to do it they want to do it in an

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,650
automated fashion they want to script it

00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,350
so getting back to mobile again I feel

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,030
very comfortable and saying that the

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,220
number of UNIX machines running on a

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,960
battery are now several orders of

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,430
magnitude above those running off of AC

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,750
and they're not plugged I mean I'm

00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:01,360
physically plugged into a few things

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,190
because I have to be but again you're

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,810
talking to radios now you're talking to

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,340
bluetooth you're talking to Wi-Fi you're

00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:09,700
talking to near field communications

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:15,510
devices your is a radio it's an RFI

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:19,000
world and that creates some interesting

00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:21,070
design pressures on you obviously power

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,360
consumption becomes absolutely key if

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:28,030
your watch or your phone goes dead after

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,250
just 24 hours of use you consider that a

00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,570
very unusable device or at least you

00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,220
you're pretty pissed off that you have

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,760
to go plug that thing and every night or

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:42,540
it's dead the next morning and because

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:44,830
radios tend to to make very sporadically

00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,020
what's the word I'm trying to find here

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,330
the quality is variable in a radio

00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,730
signal and the things like interference

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,310
and whatnot become real problems things

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,770
like channel a congestion so all of

00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,360
these things put back pressure on the

00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,330
operating system to do things like

00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,150
become more agile and hop around or or

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,800
change the the radios configuration to

00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,900
to dynamically seek out the best

00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,820
possible connection opportunities and

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,220
obviously if you're a truly mobile

00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,560
device you might be doing 100 miles an

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,270
hour down the Autobahn and continuously

00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:20,200
disconnecting and reconnecting to

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:22,330
different cell towers so that that puts

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,470
some some really interesting constraints

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:29,290
on the OS so one of the less obvious

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:32,260
points to make is that trying to debug

00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:34,450
this and actually diagnose problems in

00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,240
the field also put some some real

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:40,180
challenges on you and our telemetry

00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,130
sucks our ability to do remote debugging

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,350
sucks I'm not going to not gonna mince

00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,030
words we have some work to do there

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,010
because again if you're trying to make a

00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,260
genuinely mobile device you need those

00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,500
things you you will live and die on the

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,400
strain

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,720
those technologies so I wanted to point

00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,520
out something else that was interesting

00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,840
because if we look at our open source

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,660
brethren

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,640
one of the biggest desktop providers in

00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,590
the Linux space I think we can point to

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,320
now is abun - they're they're a huge

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:10,330
success story Mark Shuttleworth opened

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,710
his pocket book and you know basically

00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,180
wrote them a lot of blank checks and

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,030
they were able to do pretty much

00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:18,250
anything they wanted and if you look at

00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:21,220
the evolution of their website over the

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,440
last year they used to be a desktop OS

00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:28,090
and now if you look very carefully you

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,880
see cloud server desktop phone tablet TV

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,020
management and all of the large panels

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,580
down there are about how they're ready

00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:37,180
for smartphones and they're number one

00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,160
for cloud they they are they are not

00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,050
skidding toward the puck is going but

00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,900
they're chasing it they saw the puck go

00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:50,620
by and they went whoa what happened that

00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:53,470
way and we have to do the same so what

00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,410
that means in technical terms is we need

00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:59,020
to be really open to fundamentally new

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,630
approaches one of the really one of the

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:04,870
the best things that I got to do when I

00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,370
went to Apple in 2001 was get given

00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:09,040
essentially a blank check on the

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,080
engineering side I was told look we

00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,170
already pissed off first install base of

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,310
mac OS 9 users there's really nothing

00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,010
more you can do to them that hasn't

00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:22,180
already been done you're you're starting

00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:24,910
fresh with OS 10 and do whatever has to

00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,590
be done to make it the the best OS for

00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:31,510
the kinds of products that we want to

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:33,220
make and we I took them up on that that

00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,250
we all collectively took them up on that

00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,570
and we we we went I won't say we went

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,610
nuts that that would be there would be

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,950
two too strong a word but but we took

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:44,830
full advantage of it we ripped cron out

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,960
we ripped inot D out we ripped a bunch

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:49,090
of other weird legacy services for mock

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,250
out and we consulted it all at launch D

00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,520
we wrote all kinds of different

00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:56,980
mechanisms for dealing with dynamic

00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:59,290
device arrival and removal and power

00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,240
management and we just we just went to

00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,950
town and we knew that we were going to

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,140
be able to extract all the system and

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:09,280
issues through a way through the GUI or

00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,780
later with iOS with almost no UI at all

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,140
at least not for system administration

00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:17,240
and so we were able to fundamentally

00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:20,030
reaaargh attacked big big chunks of the

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:23,240
system and that was actually a wonderful

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:25,070
thing because for the first few years we

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,690
dealt with all the same reactions that

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,179
you would expect in a classic unix

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,880
environment you did what you changed

00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:34,010
what you you can have my eye netd when

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,919
you pry it from my cold dead fingers but

00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,260
we had all the same reactions it wasn't

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,510
like everybody was just like oh sure but

00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,160
a couple of years down the line when

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,110
everyone saw gee you know i can just

00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,540
launch this by dropping this file into

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,370
this directory and i can specify in a

00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,929
very flexible fashion how to scrub the

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,210
environment and how to launch in a

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:55,370
secure fashion I don't have to worry

00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,290
about people prepending stuff to my

00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,840
command line you know there were a bunch

00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,309
of of security ramifications and just

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,220
ease-of-use ramifications that came

00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:05,450
along with the Ryoka texture that in a

00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:09,250
couple of years it was like of course

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:11,780
you do it that way why wouldn't you so

00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,060
again that's really hard an open-source

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,440
then we have the the famous bike shed

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,629
effect that we like to talk about in

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,369
freebsd where you know any proposal that

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:21,919
that that threatens to change of status

00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:25,310
quo gets bike shedded to death and I

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,050
think that's really not as charming as

00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:29,179
it used to be I think that needs to

00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,889
change because to do all the things that

00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,840
I'm pointing at and to move into these

00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:34,389
markets means some things have got to

00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,000
change we've got it we've got a

00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:39,290
fundamentally we architect some things

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,859
we also need to be willing to to

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,649
shamelessly

00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:44,300
I mean adopt and and learn from things

00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,770
that are that other people are doing I

00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,030
mean we don't have to do this all

00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,359
ourselves there are a lot of

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,800
technologies out there that have been

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,240
practically offered on the plate to the

00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,280
FreeBSD community in the past and

00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,380
they've kind of said yeah it's not

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,630
really our flavor we didn't we didn't

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,850
architect that ourselves yeah well think

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,980
about it and then years ago past and

00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,270
opportunities are missed so I think we

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,700
need to be a lot less proud about that

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,680
because again we are commodity OS now

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,380
there's not a lot of point in being

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,860
truly unique in DC and

00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:17,000
more and the the last thing is I think

00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,550
we need to be willing to take on some

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,200
big-picture challenges back back in the

00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,690
90s when I first started doing this I

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,390
used to stand up in stages like this and

00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,920
talk about finding a mountain and and my

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,450
big analogy was you know when you're

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,190
going on a mountain climbing expedition

00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,140
it has a wonderfully focusing effect on

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,400
everybody involved you got a pack for it

00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,710
you got to get all the right supplies

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,450
and now it's kind of dangerous and

00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,850
you're climbing up a peak and it's hard

00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,960
but it's also incredibly rewarding and

00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,150
you're doing something that you've never

00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,880
tried to do before at least if it's the

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:49,040
first time you climb that mountain and

00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,570
it brings you all on the same page right

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,950
you're gonna climb that mountain and try

00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:56,660
not to die and I think I think we may

00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,980
have lost sight of that a little bit I

00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,810
think we need to find some more

00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,750
mountains to climb we need to pick some

00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:06,590
big-picture challenges that will be hard

00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:08,630
because you know when I I first got

00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,430
involved with this I was I was thirty

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,270
years old and thirty pounds lighter and

00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:16,250
I'm getting old and a lot of us in this

00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,840
room are getting old and we need to find

00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,760
something we need to find challenges

00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,340
that will appeal to the next generation

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,770
of of hackers and that's something we

00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,590
actually did pretty well in in the 90s

00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:29,990
and the first part of this millennium

00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:31,880
it's shocks me sometimes to realize that

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:34,100
some of the movers and shakers in this

00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,010
project that the leaders the grand old

00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,840
men were just starting college when they

00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:42,830
first came to FreeBSD they were the

00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,990
young snotty nosed kids right and now

00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,790
they're not they they they have they

00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,860
have become the new generation and and

00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:51,320
the leaders well that's going to happen

00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,880
again again if we're trying to get 10 20

00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,640
years further down the line we have to

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,930
think about that now and thank God for

00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,130
the google Summer of Code by the way

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:02,090
because I think without it we wouldn't

00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:03,680
even know what interns were so again I

00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,900
want to get specific I don't want to

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,750
just keep waving my hands up here but

00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:12,710
one obvious project idea that we need to

00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:14,420
take on is to automate a machine to to

00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,730
really run it through all of its paces

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:20,390
cradle-to-grave you need to be able to

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:23,240
monitor its configuration data and slash

00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:25,310
Etsy is a septic tank it is just a whole

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,570
bunch of weird-ass formats and

00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,060
things that have been there forever and

00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,710
ever and ever it's really really time to

00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,630
just toss that out that's one of these

00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:36,530
three architecture goals I'm talking

00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:38,570
about and I don't care about the format

00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,240
it can be yeah mole there can be JSON it

00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:44,300
can be XML but there should be a single

00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,530
way of accessing it reading it writing

00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,120
it finding it and you know it's really

00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:53,120
kind of sad that even in this day and

00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,670
age and the year 2014 if I write a new

00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,260
utility that's going to be a new demon

00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,030
that runs on my system and I need to

00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,960
have a configuration file format for it

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:05,960
there is no API I need to write my own

00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,730
bison parser and invent something and

00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,760
put it in slash let's see because why

00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,380
not everything else is there that's and

00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,970
let's not even talk about the dot files

00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:19,310
in your home directory right this is

00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:21,590
just architectural II yes and obviously

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:23,540
we need to have the the cojones to go

00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,100
back and alter all the existing tools to

00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,810
use it that's the thing that everybody

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,070
always stops at well yeah but if I come

00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,780
up with the library and I come up with a

00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:32,270
single unified format then I gotta go

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,280
change these things change them it's

00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,330
it's more trouble to talk about it than

00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,160
it is to just to do it

00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:41,230
it really is I've been there done that

00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,790
it's not as hard as it looks look and

00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,560
just to point that out that it's not as

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,750
hard as it looks to use this little

00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,760
machine here as an example everything in

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,010
OS 10 whether it's system configuration

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,200
data per app configuration data per

00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:56,390
service configuration data it's all an

00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,060
XML P list in a couple of known

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,830
locations and that's it and we went we

00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,470
hacked the utilities we did everything

00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,790
required to to unify on that is it the

00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:12,470
best format that ever walked the earth

00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:13,700
no is it good enough yes what's that no

00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,830
you just look at

00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,290
corefoundation light and you can again

00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,970
to steal the ideas you don't have to

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:22,340
take the implementation just I mean

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:24,410
there's not a lot to it there really

00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:27,470
isn't and there there are probably 50

00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:30,290
XML parsers it's you know you don't have

00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,820
to write this yourself so another thing

00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,830
that needs to be done especially if you

00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,940
want to work in the mobile space is you

00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,590
need a notification Trull eyes

00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,520
notification system you need to be able

00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:41,400
to register for notifications and

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,410
- post notifications right now on your

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,930
average FreeBSD based appliance if I

00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:49,410
even just changed my host name a bunch

00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,790
of stuff stops working that's really

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,530
silly it's one of the first

00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,020
notifications that OS 10 added was

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,880
calmed system got hostname you subscribe

00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,490
to that anybody changes it from anyplace

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,540
boom you know it's changed go do

00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,050
whatever you have to do to your internal

00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,369
State adapt move on

00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,050
obviously radios powering up and down at

00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,580
all times like I talked about that were

00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:11,130
configuration changing because you're

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,850
moving between cells your IP address is

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:16,440
changing chef or puppet has gone and

00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,210
whacked a new set of configuration it

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,340
onto you entirely and everybody now

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:23,130
needs to go and you know the world has

00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,990
fundamentally changed and right now that

00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,310
is done so crudely it's just you run

00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,590
around hit everything with a hammer that

00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:30,030
you think might have been affected and

00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,150
restart it and there's just no

00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:34,860
technology there it's just brute force

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:37,320
and it doesn't need to be it really

00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,030
doesn't what you also see is a result of

00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,710
not having a distributed notification

00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,930
system is there's a bunch of things like

00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:45,480
Active Directory libraries and one of

00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:47,970
the cache information and since they

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,930
have no way to do cache invalidation you

00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,340
know they break the first rule of

00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,290
computer science never catch anything

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,940
you don't know how to invalidate well

00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,740
what they do instead is they run a cron

00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,600
job once every hour or whatever to shoot

00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,480
the cache in the head so they do a bunch

00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,490
of work wasting a bunch of power and you

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,859
know and possibly doing needless network

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:07,290
traffic to recreate a cache that didn't

00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:09,450
need to be recreated or during that one

00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,820
hour period when that user got added

00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:14,670
over there and now people are going you

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,880
can't chose something's wrong well that

00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:20,880
cash is still screwing you up so you

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,320
really really need it and again because

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,980
I want to talk about real examples

00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:29,130
here's the notify API notify API was

00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,109
done probably in all of two weeks and a

00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,060
simple notify daemon if you have an OS

00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:35,630
ten bucks you can send it a cig user 1

00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,420
and it will dump all the subscribers

00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:41,329
into var on notify in the

00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,700
kid status and you see there's just a

00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,890
huge number of notifications and when we

00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,630
first did this we probably had five six

00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,849
in fact I think we first did it to do

00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,109
with time zone changes because we found

00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:53,779
out there was coded Lib C that was

00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:56,599
standing at C local time thousands of

00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:59,269
times a second why well because the time

00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,619
zone might have changed so it's one of

00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:03,710
the first things we did is make that a

00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:05,420
notification and you'll see if you can

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,279
read the slide that some of those smells

00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,990
just slid over too far but some of them

00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:10,730
are you know direct point-to-point

00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,710
notifications some of them are using a

00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,230
little shared memory cell so if you want

00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,549
to pull periodically just to see if your

00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,650
cache is invalid and you can do it that

00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:20,299
way it'll send you a signal it'll do any

00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,210
number of things it's open source so

00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:27,819
again either use the implementation or

00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:31,339
just use the ideas so I keep mentioning

00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:35,990
the whole system startup and service

00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:37,880
wrangling stuff is there there's an old

00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,660
saying you you you can't polish a turd

00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:46,759
but you can paint it and at CRC D is a

00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:48,589
painted at CRC so you know I was one of

00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:49,789
the architects of this stuff I think

00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:52,940
I've probably checked in the first copy

00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:55,910
of our C dot local or c.com actually

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:58,789
kiss hey let's add some knobs what harm

00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,319
can that do and it's it's evolved it's

00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:02,630
incredibly sophisticated I've actually

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,190
looked at the NCRC dot to decode and

00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,869
seeing all the little provides and you

00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,579
know require stuff in there and it's

00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:10,039
seeing how it builds a directed acyclic

00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:11,900
graph and runs all the things in the

00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:15,440
right order and it's like wow this is

00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:20,180
kind of a triumph of brute force over

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,460
adversity but it's also wrong it's just

00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,079
not how you want to do it you want to do

00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,119
things dynamically you want to

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,920
essentially just register and say hey

00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:31,130
when something who tries to talk to me

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,619
start me up and I don't want to make any

00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,329
dependencies explicit anywhere because

00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:37,970
the problem with explicit dependencies

00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:41,660
is they keep changing and you keep

00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:43,460
having to chase that dragon and anyone

00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,309
adding a new service doesn't even

00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,990
necessarily know which what they depend

00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:51,210
on they find that out by trial and error

00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:54,660
so again

00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,160
you know I'll talk about that a second

00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,630
but you know I'm not gonna sir I'm not

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,690
gonna see us launchkey because I've

00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,250
beaten that drum enough times but even

00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,880
the Linux diehards have gone with

00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,730
systemd

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,010
they've refactored their system and it's

00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:10,859
you know again just having a broker that

00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:13,559
you can register with and you know on

00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:16,440
demand with IPC or timed events or

00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,599
Hardware arrival removal will do the

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,550
right thing using some metadata to tell

00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:22,410
it what the service needs to do and what

00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:27,450
it needs to run is really the right

00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:29,099
architecture and to that last slide if

00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:32,010
you really want to do power management

00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:34,319
you also fundamentally need this because

00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,329
you can't let things run too long you

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,890
you do need you know you do need an

00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:40,020
adult in the room write something that

00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,579
says you have been running for too long

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,250
and I can see your per hour consumption

00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:46,380
going up you've run away and you know

00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,910
people write crappy code it's a fact of

00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,440
life and you're not always going to be

00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,609
able to even control what crappy code

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,990
gets installed on the system because

00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:53,670
there are these app writers who write

00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,140
these apps and they stick them on there

00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,760
and they run them in the background or

00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,799
they run them from cron or whatever and

00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,349
when one of those things runs them up on

00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:02,849
your mobile device all you know is that

00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:04,980
the mobile device which should have had

00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:07,140
a battery life of five or six days had a

00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,089
battery life of two hours and now you're

00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,770
pissed off and you blame the device you

00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:13,770
blame the crappy operating system on

00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:15,299
that device you don't blame the errant

00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,849
app because you don't even know that it

00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:19,349
was errant where where do you get that

00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:21,990
information from what what telemetry

00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,940
tells you that it was errant so you need

00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,260
to shoot it down and/or you need to at

00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,809
least have something that's in charge to

00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,099
report on it say hey this guy is acting

00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:33,000
weird you should probably do something

00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:36,839
about that so again I keep coming back

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,420
to this but yeah we need we need

00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:41,880
telemetry and speaking with my FreeNAS

00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,099
hat on we're gonna do it at iock systems

00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,290
we're gonna create a telemetry a daemon

00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:47,670
and some api's for it and we're going to

00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:50,790
pretty much destroy meant the crap out

00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:52,440
of everything because we we are at the

00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,970
pointy end of the spear in terms of

00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,799
dealing with enterprise customers who

00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:57,690
have file servers which are one of the

00:45:55,799 --> 00:46:00,089
most critical pieces of infrastructure

00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:04,030
for people and when those things go go

00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:06,730
hinky they rely on us to figure out why

00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,140
and far too often we have no idea we

00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,640
come we come to the scene of the

00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,930
accident an hour or two after it's

00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,960
already occurred and all we do is see

00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:15,220
bodies lying all over the road and we

00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,420
don't even have things to measure the

00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,680
skid marks with because there are no

00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,620
skid marks right these are virtual

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,280
bodies and it's a virtual accident and

00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:26,890
so we need to we need better than syslog

00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,930
we need some way to say all right let's

00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:31,750
look at your telemetry well what was

00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:34,090
going on in the hour prior to this event

00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,380
and maybe even what was going on from a

00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,000
couple of different data collection

00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,580
points because guess what people break

00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,500
their networks people have clients that

00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,470
go completely insane at 3 o'clock in the

00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,300
morning usually on Saturday night and

00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:48,850
start flooding you know that the server

00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,460
with with with NFS requests or just

00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,930
otherwise acting bizarre and you can't

00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,370
even always detect that from the server

00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,410
all you know is you get a lot of traffic

00:46:54,370 --> 00:47:00,310
was that good was that bad I know I

00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:02,670
don't know so usually when you talk

00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:04,900
about telemetry and remote debugging

00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:06,580
certain three-letter agency gets

00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,250
mentioned and everybody starts throwing

00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,320
things let me tell you something the NSA

00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,300
does not need our help they do their

00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,220
data collection much further upstream

00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,590
where it's already pre aggregated for

00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,180
them they do not need to attack the

00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:23,530
individual boxes that would be a waste

00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:26,110
of their time but the the users do need

00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:27,760
the telemetry because again to keep

00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,590
returning to this point maybe harping on

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,110
the little we're running in a lot of

00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:34,810
appliances now and those appliances the

00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,880
users just want them to work and you've

00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,770
probably used a hundred products just in

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,240
the last year where there's a little

00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:42,100
question do you want to help make this

00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,870
product better and unless you're really

00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,550
paranoid you probably said sure

00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:49,120
guess what that meant you signed up for

00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:50,830
telemetry so finally on the debugging

00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,900
comment which I think should be totally

00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:54,700
uncontroversial we do need a way of

00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,260
doing IP debugging and that's another

00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,820
thing that I suppose is going to sponsor

00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,280
we have a rough prototype already

00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:03,400
working but I'll tell you I could never

00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,860
have worked on this or the phone without

00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,350
some way of debugging it remotely it was

00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,180
just just insane trying to do anything

00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:12,210
else you know you're not going to always

00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,970
have a serial port or

00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:17,220
a serial over IP or you know any of

00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:19,410
those sort of kludgy ways of getting at

00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,810
debugging and of course sadly firewire

00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,980
is going the way of the dodo too and

00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:26,400
that was really cool because you could

00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:29,040
do firewire or DMA but it's leaving so

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,530
we need to be able to deal with panicked

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,140
boxes in the field over IP and that

00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:36,810
means basically a very simple IP stack

00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,580
that gets that gets used in the in the

00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:41,640
times of last resort and sighs alright

00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,530
debug me now and guess what when you

00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,910
have that feature you can also start

00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,950
doing other interesting things which

00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,510
I've used as well which is a little web

00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,790
portal things that do nothing but say

00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,920
give me an IP address and I will go

00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:55,170
connect for you and I will scrape that

00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,700
box I'll run a bunch of gdb scripts on

00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,560
it and I'll grab all the relevant

00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,630
information and I'll file a ticket and

00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,360
I'll attach the stuff to it and I'll

00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:05,160
even tell the triage team hey it's still

00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,280
there at that the debugger prompt if you

00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:10,080
want to connect and do different things

00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,670
and if you don't well I got you

00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,630
everything that most people need to to

00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:16,110
debug a kernel panic

00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:19,020
so also being able to nmi a box when

00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:20,340
it's stuck or hung or really really slow

00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,740
or you know there's some weird lock

00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,970
contention problems going on it can make

00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,440
the difference between finding a really

00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:31,830
pernicious problem that's been annoying

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:33,600
people for years and not so one other

00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:36,360
thing I've raved about on the project

00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,670
metal is a little bit is I think I think

00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,420
the SBC's the raspberry PI's the

00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,700
beaglebones

00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,500
all of that as porting platforms have

00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,450
been really valuable I don't want to

00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,950
even sound like I'm disparaging them I

00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:50,010
think they're really cool they're really

00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:52,350
cheap they're really useful and we

00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:54,150
should keep porting to them but I think

00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,980
I think we've reached the level of

00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:58,170
stability and usefulness with the arm

00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,560
port that it's time to actually move to

00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:05,550
real stuff due to to a reference phone

00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:07,320
to a reference tablet and I'm not even

00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:09,360
sure what that reference phone or tablet

00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,210
is yet there's a plethora of them right

00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,120
now if you go to Singapore or Hong Kong

00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:17,410
you can go to a market and buy five

00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,540
tablets for 400 bucks

00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,420
you know there are really generic now

00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,530
and they usually run some weird

00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,330
concocted version of Android or

00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,370
something but they are getting cheap

00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,100
enough now that at some point we're

00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:32,620
going to be able to kind of look at the

00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:34,030
horrible the not so bad and the great

00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,200
and then pick something in the middle

00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,720
because the greater probably going to be

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,460
expensive and say that's going to be our

00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,220
first restaurant platform for up the

00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,860
phone port or for a tablet port and and

00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,600
the main reason for that is is is multi

00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:49,330
well there are multiple reasons for this

00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,620
one is as I point out here you're never

00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:53,460
going to know how to deal with real

00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:56,260
radios real devices like accelerometers

00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,790
cameras etc and so forth until you

00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,300
actually run on a platform that has

00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:02,320
those things and you want to be able to

00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,970
support those things because they're

00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:07,600
part of what make a phone or a tablet an

00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:10,330
interesting device to use also being

00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,590
able to carry around a copy of you know

00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,270
FreeBSD running on one of these

00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:15,070
reference things means we'll be able to

00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:17,740
actually validate that our telemetry and

00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,630
our debugging stuff works because if you

00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:24,010
don't use it you don't live on it so to

00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:25,960
speak then you're not validating that an

00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:29,830
end user in that same role it's going to

00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,750
have a good experience and finally again

00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,010
using those sort of things will require

00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,590
that we think of a little higher up

00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,750
we're not just a kernel we our

00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:39,340
collection of services and utilities and

00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:41,170
at some point we'll have something for

00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,660
dealing with Bluetooth and dealing with

00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:45,040
audio and dealing with displays and all

00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,390
those things are gonna have to be part

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,920
of the software stack and I think it's

00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,030
time that we we tackle some of those

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,670
things because again those are the

00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,840
interesting challenges it's it's FreeBSD

00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:59,770
should be more than just hacking on

00:51:52,840 --> 00:52:01,840
Carnales so to sum it all up I think we

00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:04,750
still have some rough edges in not being

00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,850
sufficiently lego like again OS is a

00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:09,100
commodity now it's it's been out for

00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:11,920
decades and decades so we should make it

00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,900
more usable for the people who want to

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,350
automate it and virtualize it stick it

00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,360
in a cable and and not have anything

00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:22,270
that stands in the way of doing that or

00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:24,370
or essentially force them to do the

00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:27,100
subtractive exercise of pulling stuff

00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:28,470
out it's it's one of the first things

00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,390
that people do

00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,640
is have to have to yank code out of

00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:33,840
FreeBSD and that's kind of silly we

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,369
should make it possible just to

00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,470
conditionally compile it in the first

00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:39,480
place and again just to reinforce my

00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,770
previous point we need to pick hardware

00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,980
platforms that are that are real and

00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:46,109
relevant phones tablets watches cables

00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:47,730
let's let's find some reference ones and

00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:50,550
actually start porting to those and see

00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:53,220
how it works and and because we're gonna

00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:54,599
be kind of late to the party we should

00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,550
be willing to look over the fence to

00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,349
people who've already done all this the

00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,330
androids and the apples of the world

00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:01,800
have already been down this path and

00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:03,720
they've done a lot of cool technology

00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,250
some of which is open source some of

00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,020
which you can just look at a header file

00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:09,480
and say alright don't see kind of what

00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,460
they did in this design or just watch it

00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,349
work and you can learn a lot from that

00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,090
and and clone it you don't have to

00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:16,500
necessarily take the same code you can

00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,930
you can create your own independent

00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,760
independent implementation but but

00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:23,280
skipping a lot of the hard work and

00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,800
figure out what it should look like so

00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,200
and let me just say that we do have a

00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,940
bit of a rep in being resistant to this

00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,980
kind of thing that you know if you go to

00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,300
the BSD folks oh they'll bike showed you

00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,890
to death they're not going to take your

00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,450
ideas on board they're not interested

00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:38,640
that that's a really unfortunate

00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,410
reputation and I don't think it's

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,170
entirely merited but to the degree that

00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:47,820
it is we should shake it off and change

00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:50,680
that reputation so in summary the future

00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:59,450
is ours if we want it thank you

00:53:50,680 --> 00:54:05,880
[Applause]

00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:05,880
