Description: 
	Abstract:

The FreeBSD project is now over 20 years old, and the Berkeley Software Distribution from which it originated is almost 40! The last 10 years have seen some fairly radical changes in the mobile and embedded computing markets, with the number of FreeBSD-based appliances also on the rise. What this means for FreeBSD, and what the project can learn from the various members of the Fortune 500 who have put BSD technology to good use, will be the topic of this presentation.
