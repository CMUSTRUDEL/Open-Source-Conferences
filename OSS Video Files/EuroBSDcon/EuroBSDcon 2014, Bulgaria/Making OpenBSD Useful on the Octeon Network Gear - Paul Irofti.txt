Description: 
	Abstract:

My work on the Octeon port made possible for OpenBSD to run on the D-Link DSR line of mid-range routers and also improved all supported models through the drivers I wrote. I’m continuing my work on improving the OpenBSD experience on the Octeon products by enhancing network support (including advanced switch support among other things) and adding disk support via USB and CFI. This presentation summarizes the developments I brought and the obstacles I faced.
