Title: JIT Code Generator for NetBSD - Alexander Nasonov
Publication date: 2019-10-13
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

The next release of NetBSD will have a support for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of bpf programs in the kernel; this change will greatly speed-up traffic sniffing on multiple platforms. Unlike similar interface in other operating systems, bpfjit uses a unified programming interface for code generation which is based on Stack Less JIT Compiler library (SLJIT) and which supports x86, mips, arm, sparc and some other platforms.The speaker will give an overview of SLJIT API and discuss some implementation details of the bpfjit code with emphasis on supported optimizations of bpf programs by JIT engine. He will also touch on unit testing of dynamically generated code running inside the kernel and on other areas in the NetBSD project where bpfjit can help in boosting performance.
