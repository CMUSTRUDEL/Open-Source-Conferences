	Abstract:

Smartcom Bulgaria’s switching family consists of Ethernet switches targeted at offering access and aggregation layer L2 and L3 switching solutions for FTTX deployments that satisfy today’s requirements for delivering TriplePlay services with appropriate levels of QoS and security.
The family offers fixed configuration (for the access layer), as well as modular configuration (for the aggregation layer) devices with up to 24x1GE + 4x10GE Ethernet ports.
The switches run Smartcom’s control plane software, a customized version of FreeBSD. The control plane software is modular, ensuring that, even in case of software problems, the switch will continue to operate with minimal or no service disruption.
