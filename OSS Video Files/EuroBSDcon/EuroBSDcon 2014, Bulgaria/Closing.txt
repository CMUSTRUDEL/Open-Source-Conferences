00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,629
projects and community we have a group

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,940

FreeBSD whether they're teaching or

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,100

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,160
documentation we have a staff we have

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,590
two actual full time employees and we

00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,990

our project manages all of our project

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:31,560
development and we have Edie and kostik

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,360
who do development work and then I don't

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,429
know if I said the right name but Glenn

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,709

00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:45,060
and cluster ed month and then we have a

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:48,360

we'll be doing this quarter that's going

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,690
to end this week and we'll post that

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,670
financial information and probably two

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,009
to four weeks when we sell our books but

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,450
we're always open with all the money

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,190
that's coming in and all the money

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,739
that's going out and so fundraising so

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,459
we're funded totally a hundred percent

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:18,030
by by you people and so all the users

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:21,209
individual donors and in corporations

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,069
and last year we raised seven hundred

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,760
and seventy thousand dollars this year

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,370
we have a goal of a million

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,900
and hopefully more we're at about six

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,830
hundred and twelve thousand right now

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:36,310
and and what we would like to ask you is

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:38,080
you can help I mean this is obviously

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,680
more for FreeBSD because that's what our

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,360
Charter is but but what you could do is

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,849
you can make a donation I know a lot of

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,080
you did here which we which thank you we

00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,000
really appreciate it

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,599
a lot of you are entered now into the

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,780
drawing for the book which is great and

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,569
but you can also help by by sharing our

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,239
efforts on your on social media that

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:03,010
really helps a lot and and then the

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,769
other thing is really going to your

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,579
company if your company uses FreeBSD is

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:12,400
approaching them and and trying to get

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:15,340
them to donate to to us and what we're

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,069
trying to do too is provide collateral

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,160
or material that you can use to present

00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,750
your company and if you need help please

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,670
ask us because that's one thing we're

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,989
trying to help with is getting that

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:31,120
information to you lastly what do we do

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,160
we do do a lot of things we one thing we

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,680
do is we sponsor conferences like this I

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,319
think we sponsor about ten events this

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,540
year and so they may be big conferences

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,060
like this or they may be developer event

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,840
vendor summits or other like

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,819
unconference type of events and and

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,940
those are BSD related so they're not

00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:54,250
just FreeBSD we provide travel grants to

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,590
developers and so at this conference we

00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,220
have four developers who who we

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,660
sponsored we do fund development

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,519
projects we were hoping to talk about

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,560
that here but we really we don't have

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,049
time in this closing session but we have

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,569
a lot of great things that were funding

00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,459
we're currently funding to help freebsd

00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:14,859
as well as some things that are coming

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,079
up release and we provide we buy

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,789
hardware for the infrastructure we have

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,449
three facilities around the north

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:25,330
america that we provide hardware for we

00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:28,120
do provide legal support and and that

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,520
includes protecting the trademark if you

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,199
ever need legal assistance or not you

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,930
individually but usually as a project

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,419
when issues come up and and so we

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,330
provide that we do have a new freebsd

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,819
journal

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,099
I sure brought that with me but we do

00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:45,710
have that that we're handing out at our

00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:48,380
table out there and and we're doing a

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,970
lot of advocacy and that's been the new

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,949
journal that we're producing right now

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,840
and we're really trying to get out there

00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:56,449
and educate people and provide brochures

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,419
and any type of literature that helps

00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:01,580
promote FreeBSD and and the bsd

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:04,160
operating systems and then the last

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,020
thing we do is support education and

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,599
scientific research we have been funding

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,639
programs in in universities so that's

00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,259
basically what we do we are hoping to

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,870
talk about projects but we really don't

00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,819
have time so there's a lot of people

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,130
that want to come up and speak so the

00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:21,889
last thing I'm going to do is we're

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,690
gonna raffle off this book and so I'm

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,849
gonna get a number from Ed it's going to

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,130
be verified and then hopefully that

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:31,430
person is here and we can we can give

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:38,150
that book to that person so Edie you're

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:43,730
gonna call it a number oh I don't do you

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:54,970
know who you're it's Philip okay okay

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:54,970
[Applause]

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,500
okay thank you yep

00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,960
since we're given great stuff there's

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:09,090
more stuff to give away as you know in

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,169
fighting Uriel to the phones and Julio's

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,260
representing Google one of our big

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:24,130
sponsors and you do has a very nice

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:26,410
Chromebook to give way okay yes I have a

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:32,950
Chromebook but before that couple of

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:34,840
words from me so first of all as Paul

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,520
said I work for Google some of you have

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,440
asked me well I might necessarily at

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,840
Google infrastructure and some of you

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,460
have asked me what that is

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm not going to spray now but if you

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,000
have more questions on what we do and

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,280
how the work is come find me later and

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,500
I'll let you know

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,419
so then Google is a sponsor for this

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,430
conference you've seen there and it has

00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,780
been for several years already so as

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,510
part of this we have the Chromebook as a

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,610
present for the raffle and I'll leave

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:06,250
that for the end so I say something

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:09,070
before that let's see so I want to talk

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,030
about diversity because Google has a

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:16,630
program called trouble grants and

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,979
trouble conference grants so you may

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,870
have noticed a while ago Google

00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,770
published some diversity numbers where

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:26,470
they mentioned things like the

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:28,360
composition of the employees where they

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,610
come from or what their ethnicity is

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,690
what gender they are and Google is

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,070
trying to improve that and part of the a

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,330
way to do this was first to publish the

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,800
report and then some of the companies

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,180
followed suit I think for example

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,450
Facebook and Apple were two companies

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,680
that did the same thing soon after so we

00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,440
were assigned to get the data out there

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,120
so people is the word of it and one of

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,680
the ways they are trying to improve

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,419
things is by these grants so they are

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,820
targeted at groups that are

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,650
underrepresented in technology and these

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,620
in Europe at least includes women

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,540
so Google has rented for because even

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,300
four of these grants for for women to

00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,370
come to this conference and Paul would

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,690
either take a picture of them so he has

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:19,150
found the right three of you but we're

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:20,860
still missing baharon mrs. Philemon so

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,630
if you're here please let Paul know

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:28,710
later when we are done and for the

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,710
picture and with that to the rattle so

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:37,810
64 67 people have provided answers and

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:44,290
no one has gotten the eight questions

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:47,890
correctly too bad it was only eight

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,630
questions but from the eight questions

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,970
three people have gotten seven of them

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,580
correctly and that's followed by eleven

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,870
people that have gotten six correctly of

00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,350
herself um that I don't have any more

00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:04,360
details but yeah so I wrote a list of

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,010
ten possible winners in order you have

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,209
to be here to receive the present and

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,450
only one of you will get it of course

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:12,250
the first one will get it and I'm

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,080
promised the list is random it doesn't

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,910
depend on whether you got the questions

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,839
correctly or not it just has been random

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,450
selection also sixty-seven from you so

00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,779
the winner is Peter Larson if you're

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,779
here

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:37,190
[Applause]

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:50,810
motivations thank you and that's all

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:53,660
from me so next on stage is Bendix

00:09:50,810 --> 00:10:05,480
worsening and I think it's all about the

00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:08,269
goat hi so this little fellow followed

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,470
me around since BST can because Allen

00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:14,480
Jude probably exact his revenge for

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,420
dropping a commitment on video you

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,230
probably saw it on BST now and I think

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,300
my punishment should to now end I now

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,399
want to give this to someone to get the

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,730
go to the next BST conference which is

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,100
me PST California and I already picked

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,810
that person would that person be so nice

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:38,560
to come over so we've never done this

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:44,589
before but I guess there is no official

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,589
thing to hand over a goat so here we go

00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,849
[Applause]

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,540
all right he has a Twitter account the

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,010
code so follow him at twitter.com slash

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:01,260
Groff the BSD code I think camelcase the

00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:03,240
you know the letters are important so or

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:08,630
just search you'll find him

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,630

[Applause]

00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:01,959
so next on my list think is the

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:08,380
Europeans Deakin foundation who are the

00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:10,240
people who I rely on for support the one

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,880
who are with me through the entire year

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,709
you know making sure helping me out salt

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,959
all different things related to the

00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:29,019
conference big thanks to everyone from

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:33,220
the foundation the organising committee

00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:41,790
is to be honest here I'm not sure his

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:44,380
team is here but thanks to them the

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:48,750
program committee who are responsible

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,750
for the great program we have this year

00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:07,910
of course the speaker is I had the great

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,260
team I'm you also how amazing they are

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,540
the video streaming the network

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,030
everything just worked so I wouldn't

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:25,530
have done it without them

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:28,590
thankful peak times we had a bit over 70

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,960
people watching the live stream which is

00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,610
I know it's the first time we were doing

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:41,970
it so who I think that's a great number

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:43,500
and that's thanks so thank you for

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,890
happening because you know the

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,650
conference is for you and without you

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:55,710
there wouldn't be point in organizing so

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:59,240
you know I think before that's a little

00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,240
bit about the foundation okay

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:12,890
so you've heard his name your beasty

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,360
confrontation several times and come

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:19,730
spend three or four minutes to tell you

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:22,310
about this in 2001 two guys in United

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:26,510
Kingdom had a great idea to try out a

00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:29,330
first European conference on BSD it was

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,630
then called mystic on Europe later we

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,790
changed name to euro Beasley Kong you

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,680
see the countries where we had

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,380
conferences after that one because it

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,920
was such a great success but one thing

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:45,950
was fundamentally wrong every year the

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,850
organization started from scratch had to

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,280
reinvent the wheel so that's why in 2011

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,410
when we did this 10th anniversary

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,200
conference in the Netherlands we decided

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,630
there must be some way of giving the

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,990
information the knowledge the experience

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,850
we have on to the next team and share

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,340
the resources so that you don't have to

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,290
start from scratch every year and that's

00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,620
when the we beat the Europeans the

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,220
confrontation started and so far we have

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,710
already

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,500
I think successfully supported the

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:23,960
conference in Warsaw Malta and the CN

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:29,740
Sofia 2015 yeah one or two more minutes

00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:30,860
and then you know how do we help local

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,590
organisations

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,170
well first by helping to seek new

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,660
candidates and when that doesn't work

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:42,260
which is appoint volunteers like we did

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,650
yesterday then we transfer our knowledge

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:48,980
and experience by a lot of personal

00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:52,190
interaction both in phase or by email

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,480
and IRC and we just help the local

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,590
organization through the whole process

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,210
having it done ourselves before we have

00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,420
a ready-to-use website and a

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,790
registration system the foundation is a

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,620
legal entity taking the risk of the

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,800
shoulders of the local organization

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:12,740
local organizers we have the bank

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,260
account financial administration and we

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,020
know our recurring sponsors and how to

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:20,290
contact them also quite important to

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,290
keep

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,410
we try to control quality a little bit

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:31,799
we had various levels of quality with

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:35,100
the first 10 euro bistec on editions one

00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:37,530
way we do that is by having members of

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:41,940
the various Beasley projects in our

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:44,370
boards so no more sounds of hey our

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,740
projects has not had a good

00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:51,049
representation in this conference we now

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:54,840
all get a fair share transferring

00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:56,909
experience also means that previous

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,030
organizers remain in the board for

00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:04,679
another year and have their firsthand

00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:07,740
experience to give to the next team we

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,020
also allow future candidates to already

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,929
join the boards listening on all the

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,500
meetings and see what's going on before

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:21,210
their before it's their turn to actually

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:24,169
