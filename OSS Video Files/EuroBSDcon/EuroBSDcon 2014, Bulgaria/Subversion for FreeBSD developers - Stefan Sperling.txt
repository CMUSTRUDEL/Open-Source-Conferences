	Description:

FreeBSD switched from CVS to Apache Subversion in 2008. It is the only
major BSD operating system using Subversion for version control and one
of the largest open source projects using it. This tutorial provides a
solid introduction to Subversion geared towards FreeBSD developers.We’ll start with a quick review of Subversion’s design from its conception
in the year 2000 and all the features and quirks added during its still
on-going evolution.We’ll talk about Subversion’s repository and working copy, merging and
merge-tracking, how Subversion’s tree conflict detection feature can
help but also get in the way, the why and how of pitfalls associated
with renames, and more.FreeBSD’s workflow built around Subversion will be discussed with
attendees and reviewed for problems and possible improvements.
Attendees are welcome to present any issues they’ve run into with
Subversion during FreeBSD development.

Stefan Sperling works as Subversion developer and consultant at elego
Software Solutions GmbH based in Berlin. He has been contributing to
the Subversion project since 2007. He’s been involved in OpenBSD
development since 2008 even though code he produces during hackathons
