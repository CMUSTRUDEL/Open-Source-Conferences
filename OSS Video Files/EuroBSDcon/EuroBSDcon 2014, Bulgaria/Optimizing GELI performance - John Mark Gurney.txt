Title: Optimizing GELI performance - John Mark Gurney
Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

Features, like encryption, need to have minimal overhead for them to be widely adopted. If the performance is to slow, few people will use it. The first iteration of AES-XTS using AES-NI in FreeBSD was not much faster than the software version of it. The talk will describe why the AES-XTS algorithm was slow and what was done to improve it. It will cover topics from intrinsics, adding them to gcc and advantages of using them over assembly to how to use HWPC that are included in most modern processors to evaluate performance to identify performance bottle necks.
