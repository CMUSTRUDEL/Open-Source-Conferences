Title: Developing Software in a Hostile Environment - Ted Unangst
Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

Previous talks about exploit mitigation have generally focused on changes designed to prevent or resist system compromise by an attacker. However, many of these changes are also useful in the general software development process. I’ll present an overview of features present on OpenBSD and how they can help developers for all platforms.
Speaker biography:

I have been an OpenBSD developer for 11 years. When not hacking and slashing LibreSSL, I’m engaged in an ongoing battle with the ports team to break as many ports as possible.
