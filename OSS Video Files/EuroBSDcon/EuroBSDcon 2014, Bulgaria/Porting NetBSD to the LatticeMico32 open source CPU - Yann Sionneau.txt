Title: Porting NetBSD to the LatticeMico32 open source CPU - Yann Sionneau
Publication date: 2019-10-13
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

I will describe the work I did on the open source LatticeMico32 softcore CPU to add a MMU to its pipeline and then how I added support for this enhanced LM32 CPU in the NetBSD 6 kernel.I will quickly explain what a MMU is and how it works in LM32. I will then show an overview of the steps I followed to add support for this new CPU and this new System-on-Chip to the NetBSD kernel. Afterward I will explain some of the choices made for this port, especially those in relation with the MMU handling : the (machine-dependant) virtual memory system (aka pmap).I will demo the boot of the NetBSD kernel on QEMU emulating LM32 CPU and then on the Milkymist One VJ Station.

Speaker biography:

Yann Sionneau is a 26 year-old French embedded software engineer passionate about learning how embedded systems work in general.Yann is part of the M-Labs (fka Milkymist) community that is working on developing open source digital designs on FPGAs as well as making it more and more easy to do so by providing a simple but yet powerful framework for System-on-Chip design.Yann contributed the original RTEMS Board Support Package of the Milkymist One video synthesizer, a Memory Management Unit (MMU) for the Open Source soft-core CPU LatticeMico32, and ported NetBSD kernel for the LM32 CPU and the Milkymist System-on-Chip. Yann recently became an EdgeBSD developer and his work on LM32 support is currently upstream in an EdgeBSD branch.
