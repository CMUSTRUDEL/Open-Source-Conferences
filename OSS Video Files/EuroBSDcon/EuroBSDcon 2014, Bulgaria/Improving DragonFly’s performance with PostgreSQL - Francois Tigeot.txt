Title: Improving DragonFly’s performance with PostgreSQL - Francois Tigeot
Publication date: 2019-10-13
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

Since its creation, the DragonFly operating system had contained a giant lock in its kernel, preventing more than one thread to use kernel resources at the same time. This big lock was finally removed after the 2.10 release. I then started to look for a good way to test the multi-processor performance and scalability of the operating system. PostgreSQL seemed to fit the bill with its PGbench tool.This talk will focus on how PostgreSQL was used as a benchmarking tool to check and improve DragonFly’s performance and scalability.
