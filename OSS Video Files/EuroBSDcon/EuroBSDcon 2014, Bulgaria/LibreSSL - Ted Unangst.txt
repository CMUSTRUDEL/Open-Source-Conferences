	Abstract:

A walkthrough of the changes the OpenBSD team has made to the OpenSSL (now LibreSSL) codebase in order to conduct an audit. Design flaws in a code base can quickly turn into real flaws. Often, a second design flaw then masks the existence of the first flaw, making it difficult to fix. We’ve tried to reveal, if not correct, many of these flaws by simpliyfing and reducing the code. Along the way, we’ve made some mistakes as well.

Speaker biography:

I have been an OpenBSD developer for 11 years, working in many areas, but have recently been spending a lot of time in the libssl directory. I stumbled into, and possibly initiated, LibreSSL development after trying to determine why OpenBSD’s exploit mitigation tachniques were useless against Heartbleed.
