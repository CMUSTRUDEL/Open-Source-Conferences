Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

Everything started with the desire to have a distributed filesystem better than NFS, which would be elastic and replicated with no SPOF. glusterFS was among the filesystems that could do that, but it uses The FUSE interface to the kernel, which was not available on NetBSD.We will therefore discuss FUSE implementation and its NetBSD counterpart which is called PUFFS. A first but isufficient bridging attmpt called reFUSE was done, but porting real filesystems required the more complete PERFUSE bridge, which we will present here.In a third part, we will look at the various unexpected roadblocks that had to be handled during PERFUSE implementation, in order to get a fully functionnal glusterFS on NetBSD.
