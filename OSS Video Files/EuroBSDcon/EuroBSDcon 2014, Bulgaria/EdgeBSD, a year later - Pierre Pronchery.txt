I think you can hear me better now yeah

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,120
I'm sorry about that I forgot yeah

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,309
so I just repeat briefly what I just

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,379
said I'm Corbin a busy developer and now

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:19,380
also HP SD uh-huh so why HP SD yeah

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,670
because net BSD is a modern and cool

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,260
operating system so it drives a lot of

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,710
research development efforts like rump

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,980
and MINIX it runs almost everywhere but

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,170
it uses CVS for development and

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,719
unfortunately modern coders like I would

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,000
define myself maybe no longer will like

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,540
to use CVS because it's a decentralized

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,860
world and also modern you just don't

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,570
want to phone with a Raspberry Pi

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,910
because it's cool to run at BSD no

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,230
raspberry pie but if you want to work to

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,879
run at least you on your phone for

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,730
instance well you don't want it to look

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,100
like this maybe it's fine for you I

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,870
don't know it's a really open phone you

00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,579
can see whatever is going on you can see

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,250
when your battery blows up it's right

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,049
there this is a really cool project

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,600
though and I don't mean to say anything

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,920
wrong but right now at BSD runs on this

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,170
but you may not want to have this in

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,270
your pocket every day however it

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,770
disproves the point also that net BSD

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,450
can run on a phony so it was one of the

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,840
reasons where I started in HBS the unit

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,200
first place one of the few reasons all

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,600
of the lots of reasons anyway that PST

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,100
has tons of cool features but a lot of

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,829
them are unfortunately disabled by

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,450
default or they are not used much and

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,189
they tend to rot and this is really sad

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,110
like Kim right here like net BSD was the

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,060
first major OS to have signed binary

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,470
packages or support for signed binary

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,860
packages because actually they were

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,829
never generated in the first place

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,750
officially at least a SLR was here a

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,530
long time ago but never enabled by

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,810
default so it has a few bugs still even

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,850
if it does work a bit

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,350
sspe is also used in some places but not

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,060
everywhere so it's not always possible

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,240
to build a tree if you enable it for

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,099
like our more this is like that

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,619
generally wise I wanted more freedom to

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,599
test break share and use your code with

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,270
friends and different maybe between a

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,050
different machine

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:21,400
and none of that and CVS makes it a pain

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:24,550
so HP st started as sort of a fork of

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,450
net bsd using it so it started in july

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,120
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,460
that's a bit more than a year ago just

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,100
before the announcement just in case a

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,840
beefed up the web hosting and i

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,180
announced it at frost con that same

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,590
month and my web hosting in spite of the

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:44,080
beefing up didn't survive a reddit

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,270
attack it went on on reddit and so after

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,360
that i presented to protect again a bit

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,600
less rushed at FOSDEM 2014 there is a

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:57,070
video for this also and i presented also

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,570
a more in-depth opinion about what we

00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,390
could improve in at bsd regarding

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,490
processes and so on in asia bsd colonies

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,680
here it's called coffee net bsd but it

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,750
was actually from Gumrah may you another

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,780
net busy developer that's me you and

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,120
myself and also right now i'm rushing

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,730
this talk unfortunately but i hope it's

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,280
going to be entertaining anyway or

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,780
informational at least okay so what do I

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,840
have today actually I have more stuff I

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,480
should have taken a bit more Hardware on

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,040
my table but I have some time for that

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,670
but before going getting into a hardware

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,550
I have some mirrors so yoga Nurnberger

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,040
and that busy developer has worked for a

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,650
while on converting the CVS tree to get

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,260
through fuzzy luxury and he's been

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,330
publishing this on github and so I felt

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,240
like okay when I try to work with this

00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,010
instead of the CVS tree so basically we

00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,140
have a mirror of these two original

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,780
trees plus two is where we allow

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,300
ourselves to modify stuff one for sauce

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,520
one for package sauce and any official

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,709
developer of the hpod project can just

00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,860
push code except for master and the

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,850
release of entrees which are managed by

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,480
the breeze manager

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,890
meaning me right now but you can join so

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,200
all it takes to be an official developer

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,030
is to agree on our current project

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,000
organization document just like one page

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,739
and to give me your public as a search

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,209
key I just fill it in to our system and

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:22,450
then you can do whatever you want over

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,729
SSH except pushing to master and release

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,419
branches because there is still a

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:29,250
process

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:31,020
anyway so we do have also a couple more

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,060
repositories than just saw same package

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,819
shows one for the infrastructure work

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,629
like what I push the cron jobs and some

00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,009
binaries which are used for build builds

00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,949
the artwork because we have a very nice

00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,870
logo on the Left we have a mascot but we

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,960
don't have a logo for the mascot yet

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,370
it's a hedgehog I have some pictures of

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,050
hedgehogs but I don't think you want to

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,840
you know I don't think you are here for

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,270
watching pictures of hedgehogs

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,180
anyway manage the tree with Geeta right

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,389
which is an awesome system for managing

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,199
privileged access on git repositories

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,940
does a lot of stuff for me

00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,009
which I really appreciate because I

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,469
really want with this project also to

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:12,479
automate a lot of the work sits right

00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:17,159
now still a small community but I hope

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:21,419
to grow it a bit maybe so anyway where

00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:23,520
we are now we have two releases the

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,090
stable release is based on NBC 6 so it's

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,860
HP sd-6 this weighs less confusing I

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:33,000
guess even if we skipped like five three

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,330
zero so an Aussie kid Mario's HP 87 is

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,300
already available even if it's just

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:42,840
actually a fork of the netbiz d7 branch

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,490
as of a few weeks ago and I just build

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,169
sets and they are there but right now

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,560
it's not automatically being updated

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:53,849
even though it's a requirement that we

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,710
have we provide signed binary packages

00:05:53,849 --> 00:06:00,000
which we maintain for security actually

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:02,879
so they are based on the 2013 q1 branch

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
from package shows and we maintain it in

00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,139
a long-term support fashion because

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,349
actually it's to a last branch of net

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:13,319
bsd of package shows with modular code

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:15,210
which was not broken on base so I had to

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,009
stick to this version of xorg and

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,960
drivers to keep it running on my laptop

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,150
with like possibility to use the

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,979
internal driver so that's another

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,050
motivation factor for starting the

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:27,000
project and maintaining this for

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,650
security in a longer term but it was

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,240
also a big experiment because I was

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,219
basically as far as I know the first one

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,130
to do this publicly and I wanted to

00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:39,449
check if actually I could do that the

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:41,520
answer is yes and no behind secret

00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,529
you update but on the other hand with

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,650
Gidget was very easy to just pull

00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:49,550
changes from the security updates on the

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,439
current branch and to get them back so

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:57,569
this this is quite okay it's not such a

00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:59,099
big deal and more than that noticing

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,249
that we achieved is to build the

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:04,020
packages in an unprivileged mode so that

00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:05,939
bsd packaged source if you want to

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,219
publish binary packages usually you will

00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,580
build them as route and I don't like

00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,129
that

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,110
so instead I managed to use fake route

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,330
and to trick package sauce into building

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,039
packages which which are exactly like

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,189
they would be if they would be built

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,050
privileged except they are not so the

00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:25,379
only issue is when I installed and the

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,669
packages inside the bulk the but builder

00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,349
where I have to feel to use spec route

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:29,939
sometimes when it creates users and

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,699
groups and I have to pre feed the users

00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,319
and groups but actually it's possible to

00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,300
automate all of that or so because you

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,249
can put hooks on package or packages

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,839
when they get installed you create the

00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,479
users in groups ahead of time and it's

00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,010
not also such a big deal so this works

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,320
and it we can do it yes

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,320
[Music]

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,190
so during build time I had absolutely no

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,630
issue with no package at all because

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,570
package sauce is usually meant to also

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,740
work and privileged so I guess the few

00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,590
issues that there might have been have

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,030
been ironed out already like we can

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,350
bootstrap in on privilege mode but then

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,760
it will generate different kind of

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,100
packages like which are mate only for

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,580
you and there are slightly different and

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,950
the issue that I have is when the

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,930
install scripts create users and groups

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,289
or do otherwise privilege operations

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,140
where they fail and so in this case

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,729
either I run them using fake route or I

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,080
create the users and groups ahead of

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:46,400
time and usually it it's okay so this

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,060
works so the current community if you

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,850
want to check out what we are up to we

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,140
are mostly hanging out on IRC right now

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,270
actually almost everything is on IRC

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,800
right now which is good and bad because

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,500
then it doesn't get archived even if we

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,010
have really fruitful discussions so we

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,320
have the HP SD channel on freenode

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,420
we have a like five six developers who

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,950
are like talking a lot and coding a bit

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,200
or cutting a lot sometimes like yawn

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,380
over there that's not a real picture of

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,460
yawn that's all I could find

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,870
sorry mate and we also have two mailing

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,570
lists which are therefore not very

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,300
active right now but we have one for us

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,860
and one for developers usually I cross

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,720
post anyway because I have only big

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,950
announcements there because yeah we

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,350
don't have much traffic right now but

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,670
maybe with more people hopefully they're

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:40,190
gonna be more useful anyway now to get a

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,900
bit more into details of more

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,200
motivations why I spoke about the phone

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:48,020
thingy and and another reason for the

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,300
for the project before doing all of that

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,110
and joining an NPS D I was part of the

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:57,290
open moko adventure which was a

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:59,960
smartphone looking like this so a bit

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,460
ugly I have to admit all plastic but

00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,230
other than that it was great some people

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,950
even say it was a new iPhone the open

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,660
source yeah I didn't have such high

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,340
hopes but I was trying really hard to

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,570
like make it work because it

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,950
should have been just the first step for

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,260
something better and some of the

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,890
objectives initially defined were

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,510
achieved

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,010
like some people managed to get parts of

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,410
the phone put something else inside it

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,240
and make it into a different phone more

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,000
powerful we reusing some of the

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,180
components and we now have three four

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,320
competing smartphone stacks in open

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,750
source including mine because at the

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,820
time I was not satisfied with open hand

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,440
which was abandoned or the pison stuff

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,180
from open moko which was also abandoned

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,190
then there was FSO we did study from

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,700
scratch and I did see it going anywhere

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:48,250
so I did my own stuff again so it's a

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,660
bits on one hand that there were so many

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:54,920
different initiatives in parallel and

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,529
not one with a lot of like active

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,140
developers on it but anyway I didn't

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:02,660
stop working on this but now I proof

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,339
annette bsd so i really want to have net

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,810
bsd running on a phone and to use it

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,660
instead of whatever and you eat crap I

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,630
could buy nowadays sorry if you have one

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,070
I mean it's just my opinion but even if

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,790
it has a pair of net bsd inside your

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:18,680
system so anyway I wrote a desktop

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:22,100
environment and as part of that I have

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,780
wrote it telephony framework and it is

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,530
my intention as the benevolent dictator

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,940
to impose the default desktop as I mean

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,920
to impose my desktop as the different

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,020
one but then we do have a reference

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,480
software stack on which everybody must

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,220
focus or at least it gets installed by

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,280
default so that things are tested and

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,280
hopefully being debugged and working

00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,450
properly so the project is called the

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,839
four hours something that I've been

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,990
working on about 10 years right now by

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,180
now if not 13 actually I studied in 2001

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,390
in a different way and it was based on

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,870
Linux I have to admit so d 4 is actually

00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,490
Debian for all it's not connected to

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,339
fedora whatever I had the domain name

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,230
before nowadays of course it's a bit

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:10,550
unfortunate that Fedora happened well it

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:14,240
for me at least but anyway the project

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:16,790
is decomposed composed of three major

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,280
directions for developments a

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,130
distributed framework a self hosting

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,960
environment and graphical interface so

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,410
my real goal is the gist

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,480
distributed stuff the self estate stuff

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,920
is more for fun and learning and the

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,890
graphical interface just happened

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,570
because I didn't like gnome or KDE or

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,330
whatever else there was at the time it

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,670
was all slow and sluggish on my sparc64

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,180
machine and i found out that by doing it

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,860
myself

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,980
I could achieve just as much and it

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,300
would be actually faster and today it

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,350
fits on AMOLED platforms

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,700
therefore so I can speak more about it

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,980
repeated stuff a bit later

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,860
technically it's a lot like what Jordan

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,110
mentioned inside the keynote to have

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,800
like distributed single point of access

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,140
inside the system and and one way to do

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,120
to do everything and to have events all

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,010
coming from the same place and this is

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,100
all there even if it's just a really

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,390
rough prototype really hawkish but it

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,980
used to work at some point now I'm

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,220
currently rewriting everything a bit

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,950
more seriously but it's a bit tough to

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:26,540
tackle everything at the same time so

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,970
anyway the desktop it has a file and

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,800
disturb manager it has a panel a web

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,390
browser email client telephony

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,510
applications that I mentioned

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:38,450
media player screensaver camera

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:41,390
application and so on and so forth even

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,830
documentation all written with gtk to no

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,839
other dependencies whenever I could

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,279
achieve it and the UNIX way you can just

00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,190
take like the media player

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,330
alone on its own it's going to work

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,860
unlike some of the chrome stuff and

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,230
whatever which need whichever bus or

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,970
whatever else what I don't have right

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,420
now still is a proper window manager and

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,770
a session manager also would be nice if

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,390
you want to have a quick look at it

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,150
actually I'm running it right now

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:08,720
so if I just leave the PDF viewer which

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:11,600
I I could have used mine actually what

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,850
it was written by your friend one of the

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,089
few contributions that I got so it

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,880
should be like this so this is from the

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:22,190
D for a desktop even walks full screen

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,279
as far as I know it's not great

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,890
it doesn't sue me not romantically yet

00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:31,120
but it's working progress so as to PDF

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:34,339
you also have a famine I do like in here

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,560
can make things bigger a bit so have

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,079
some nail support

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,089
a plug-in system here so you can have a

00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:45,529
directory tree goes through your system

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:49,430
like like you would expect I also have a

00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:52,130
camera application because I'm targeting

00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,730
emitted so I also have something to take

00:14:52,130 --> 00:15:00,529
pictures hopefully it's going to work

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:02,089
why it doesn't need work come on oh it's

00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:06,279
you okay I couldn't see it on my screen

00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:08,930
so it's it's busy you didn't busy

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:17,180
something is using my camera device for

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:18,740
some reason you when you say anyway

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,519
I could I could show a bit more of this

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,320
later for now back to the presentation

00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,320
unless you want to see more yes

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:32,149
so I'm walking on a graphic restorer

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,940
based on the same applications same like

00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:36,620
framework that I did a presentation tool

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,500
because my manager would be nice also of

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,910
course I have a beginning of a

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,339
development environment also based on

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,769
this with a simulator for embedded

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:50,540
devices where you have a small X window

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:53,269
with the same depth dpi but that by GPRS

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,339
same resolution as the actual phone or

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:57,230
device for emulating and you can touch I

00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,959
call so it the font size is fine the

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,579
picture resizing and so on a beginning

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:06,320
of a graphical is assembler and exist

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:07,490
Merida tour and so on of course I would

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,540
like to work more on the distributor

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,800
stuff that's something else but right

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,310
now as things are

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,730
I'm already fairly well integrated with

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:22,279
this met BSD as a thing I can even show

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,820
some of that like if I disconnect the AC

00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:27,260
it should say maybe yeah you can see

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,100
only part of that but on top right it

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,370
says ACPI

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,720
AC ad 0 adapter disconnect to it I can

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,199
put it back it will be

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,810
happy food performance awesome of course

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,189
for an end user right now a CPI acad

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,730
zero is not very talkative

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:47,420
but it's can be tuned of course I have

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,600
also what can I show at the battery

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,040
reports

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,079
if I just press the battery button on my

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,730
laptop it's going to show this which is

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,439
quite neat so this is like all fairly

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,649
easy to to implement like we just

00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:05,000
basically do panel message with like you

00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:09,079
can choose a separate icon I guess like

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:16,439
warning and or I can even have this

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:18,360
hello people and you should say yes so

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,039
you can easily script events from the

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,809
system have them integrated here have

00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,270
your own widgets up there I mean it's

00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:28,669
it's it works fairly easily

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:31,080
I have to document a bit more as always

00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:32,549
but I've been giving a couple talks

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,580
about this the different ways they

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,559
stopped at package shows gone and a bit

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,809
more in detail at first them this year

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,250
there are videos online so you if you

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,260
want to have more details if you don't

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,740
have enough time today we can have look

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:50,070
at this or come to see me at any time

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,590
the website is defraud org so you're

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,669
free to have a look even if I admit the

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,710
do website is not in the best shape

00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:57,690
right now

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:02,490
so now the hard way yes we can play a

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:04,320
bit more with toys so I brought some

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,710
stuff some of which I already

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,289
demonstrated a couple different talks

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,600
touch unit bsd at euro bsd con two years

00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:15,539
ago and there are more recent versions

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,610
of this talk it's about the tablet

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,470
device which are brought here which runs

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,950
net bsd

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:26,220
with my desktop environment in a finger

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:30,570
friendly mode i can show a big what he

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:33,000
looks like what I mean by that and I

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,640
really want to run net bsd or h bsd on

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,630
my phone so i also tried to work on the

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:42,120
Nokia 900 and I can talk about it at BSD

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:45,690
can a year ago so this is the tablet

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,090
that I'm working on sometimes

00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,980
so it's called the wetab it doesn't have

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,690
a BIOS so it starts directly into the

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,550
netbsd bootloader which is really cool

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,650
we can even hide that with a splash

00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,780
screen and it would look like a

00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,640
commercial device like just go straight

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,320
into like some nice screen and then

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,840
after 1 minute it would do user

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:09,510
interface it has like a slot for a SIM

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:11,040
card Wi-Fi and everything works so if

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,560
you are interested you can also show or

00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,300
come here and touch the device you will

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,760
actually react and hopefully in the same

00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,220
place as well you press the screen and

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:26,720
if not I'm responsible I've wrote the

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:28,800
 driver so let's have a look so

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,510
unfortunately my camera doesn't work it

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,000
wouldn't be very practical to show it

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:38,990
like this I don't think our livestream

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,400
customers non-clients is how we say it

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,480
you can see much right now so I'm going

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,990
to try to put some stuff on screen

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,540
instead stefan screen so I mentioned is

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,670
development environment I have something

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,870
called a simulator very original name

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:58,020
and basically it's like this it's like X

00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:01,710
nest or what's the other one that I'm

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:06,860
using forgot as if here as if you're and

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:10,860
so you can say ok I want to run no

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:13,170
producing in embedded the in slash panel

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,810
and if we run the same panel that I'm

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,600
running right now on my desktop but in

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:20,430
edit mode with my current desktop

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,170
configuration so unfortunately it's not

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,900
very variable right now because it uses

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:27,270
the same font size and everything you

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,010
don't have much time to tweak but I can

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,860
do more I can run the window manager

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:36,000
like I can show you much talk so far

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,130
it's not going to crush everything ok

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,660
it's not that

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:47,710
it should be okay otherwise I can't

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:49,960
Ramirez UT yes okay so now have even in

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,690
virtual desktops and everything and I

00:20:49,960 --> 00:21:01,450
can run the file manager again in

00:20:52,690 --> 00:21:05,680
embedded mode and here it is so the menu

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:07,450
bar is gone so the missing actions which

00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,400
were only found in a menu bar and I'll

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,570
go into the tool bar you still have

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,950
access over like different views here

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:18,490
you still have access to the plugins I

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,320
have some fancy ones like forget where I

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,120
can initiate oh we can actually play

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:28,860
with that so I can go to slash temp make

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:32,110
a folder okay not miss you so new folder

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:36,420
this one we go here I create a git

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:40,570
repository it's fine now I can create

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,490
text file okay it's fine I can okay I

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:47,170
run out didn't I don't support adding

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:49,800
files but we can do it manually it and

00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,800
blah blah blah

00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:03,669
save and now if I come back here I can I

00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:05,740
should be able to say okay I want the

00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:07,870
log and there you go you have it and it

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,880
works the same way it's just running a

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:14,320
regular commands now in a stupid window

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:16,809
or the same way for CVS and for SVN and

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,309
it's very simple to extend I also have

00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:21,460
like some properties and you can also

00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:24,159
have them here blah blah in embedded

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:27,929
mode there is a button emulation through

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,039
gtk it just triggers the pop-ups so

00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,509
basically that's that's what he looks

00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,690
like and of course I can tweet the

00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:37,809
configuration to make the window manager

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,940
bar go away like with my box I can make

00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:41,919
the icons a bit bigger and then with the

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,700
finger it's easy to access everything

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,899
and use the system even if it's on a

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:54,460
smaller screen so it's kinda neat

00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:56,529
hopefully I want my slides again and

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,950
then the nokia de Madrid so

00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:03,820
unfortunately I'm afraid it will not be

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:06,370
charged but I can show you anyway

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,519
I have a net bsd kernel running booting

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:15,370
on my 100 phone if I have it here

00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:17,980
somewhere and there is a video also

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,600
online as part of my talk at mystic on

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,919
I believe so you can see it actually

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:28,539
booting here I thought that it's charged

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:31,240
no but I can connect it so I'm not the

00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:33,190
only one to actually be working on a

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,269
phone hardware right now inside a net

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:40,059
busy project I believe reimu is working

00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:42,669
on a samsung stock right now I saw some

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:46,470
commits I don't have any Samsung phone

00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:48,909
so I couldn't check anything yet but

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,169
looks like I'm not the only one to be to

00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:54,460
have interests in this which is really

00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:57,460
cool and yeah I mentioned that the demo

00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,230
on this phone right now is is a long one

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,809
because it still takes a couple minutes

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,879
to boot but that's with the sauces from

00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,740
current from two years ago and since

00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:07,559
then there was a lot of progress and I

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,009
couldn't test with a more

00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:12,960
recent scandal on this Hardware yet good

00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:14,749
time for that sorry but if you want to

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,370
have a look at net bsd booting on this

00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:21,570
it should work after it charge for a

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:23,549
couple minutes I can show you I even got

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,549
to start eggs sometimes so we could

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:28,409
actually use it as a tablet first and

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:34,440
then hopefully someday give phone calls

00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:39,749
I hope so how to make this whole

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:43,860
development tasks more convenient how to

00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:46,860
make everything easier we as part of HP

00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,970
SD need to cross build packages we are

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,690
not doing this right now but there is

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:53,429
some good stuff going on with net bsd

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,159
with package sauce where it should be

00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:59,399
possible i believe there is another c

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,950
wrapper project there is a docker body

00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,960
tomorrow if I remember from York and

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,210
Martin Buser man and they are making

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,220
this much more convenient I didn't

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,440
follow much myself but apparently they

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,269
got a lot of progress appreciate have

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,369
been able to build a lot of different

00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:16,559
packages to cross build lots of

00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:19,259
different packages I would really like

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,899
to have also more graphical tools for

00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:26,009
debugging and development like I would

00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:27,929
need an SPI best simulator because when

00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:31,289
you work on such stuff you have dozens

00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:33,899
of pages of like a4 sheets with

00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,179
registers to push and pull and like the

00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:38,369
some text to explain how the SPI bus

00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,559
works but to put everything into a

00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:42,090
picture and like connect this to the

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,159
driver the Quadro writing and how it's

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:46,460
going to work it should be complicated

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,230
so to have like graphical simulators for

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,700
drivers would be would be awesome and I

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,240
don't think it would be so much work I

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,830
have a couple ideas how to do this so

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,899
this morning Jordan also mentioned

00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,460
remote debugging so it's a very good

00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:02,850
idea

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,320
we should have tools for for this Moto's

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,619
better tools is all about the tools

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,779
tools tools tools and one such tool that

00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:14,940
I've been working on as part of HP SD is

00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:16,889
called H and it's meant to create ready

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,710
to flash system images so what do I mean

00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:20,730
by that actually it's just a search a

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,820
shell script

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:28,320
which takes a bunch of sets packages it

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:32,040
just generates for instance a big file

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,310
once it as a row disk image like with VN

00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:37,080
config it's it's it looks like a disk to

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,940
the system so you can run fdisk on it

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,100
you can partition it prepare everything

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,950
install everything like it would be in a

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,420
Schrute and bam you have a bootable

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,040
system after that you can even install

00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:51,270
the bootloader in this virtual device

00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,860
and it works supposedly I hope my I mean

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,080
I guess my demo will not work just for

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,820
the boot reversing I can fix it but

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,560
anyway I can show you it works

00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,970
completely offline we don't need to

00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,490
start with VM for that you don't need to

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:05,070
run any kind of recipe over SSH or

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,110
whatever which I do not like and it

00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,960
works therefore across architecture and

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:13,710
systems I can even generate almost

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:17,670
working debian fruit with edge right now

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:21,210
after my support for that so this is how

00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:24,180
it looks like right now so technically

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:27,090
you can use minus H it says hostname but

00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,130
really it takes it looks in a directory

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,620
for a file called after this was named

00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,470
for a default configuration and

00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,420
minification if you need of the recipes

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,910
to create the to create every single

00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,290
country files and so on the target file

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,480
name if you want to create not just to

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:45,780
show root but an actual file with a

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,380
system image and you can of course use -

00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:51,030
Q - v4 quiet of air bus mode some

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,220
variables are really easy while dealing

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,400
with we sort of this they're really not

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:59,150
easy or useful while getting with Rufus

00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:02,750
and let me show you how it all works

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:05,730
okay so I have a terminal here normally

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,110
okay it was in the right folder or no

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:11,840
here's the right folder so this is edge

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:14,850
here let's do current usage screen and

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,590
technically I can simply run it right

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,170
now ways to do because it needs to like

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,660
USB in config and so on and months this

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:25,140
is fake file system and I can tell it to

00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:30,420
use my recipe file for the my base it

00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:32,130
should be as the system like the most

00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,920
basic thing I can generate but that

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,710
should work and just output

00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,440
to file called base EMG and let's see

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:43,960
how what it does so if I do that and

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,860
enter my password so it will directly

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,020
partition the fake drive after

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,180
generating like a sparse file actually

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,400
when you can with this image so it's

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,130
that's why it's so fast I didn't stalls

00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,070
a kernel right now in my recipe file

00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:01,850
it's just generic it's extracting three

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,470
sets right now base etc' and modules so

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:10,850
it's going to take like another eight

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:12,380
seconds here six for a bit more yeah it

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,850
is you should be really fast in modules

00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:22,700
fairly fast I can zoom in maybe a bit

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:29,540
more for put it for screen like this so

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:36,200
that's four bays please go ahead and

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:38,420
complete yes ok EGC now simple I'm using

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,260
progress from the BSD for the progress

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:44,330
bar and then it installs the bootloader

00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,980
and that's it okay try to instruct new

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:47,990
PC but I don't have network access right

00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:52,490
now or this mirror is not on my machine

00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:56,530
anymore locally so now supposedly it

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:59,360
installed everything and I can try to

00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,460
run Q on it I suspect it will fail

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,530
because of the thing that I just noticed

00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,470
before this talk but hopefully I'm going

00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:09,320
to be able to fix it let's try to launch

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:14,309
in anyway first real quick it works okay

00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:17,009
so I found a fix

00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:20,129
so I prefer when it's this way so this

00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:22,019
is cream you running right now running

00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:24,239
on the fight which are just generated so

00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:28,799
I just generated working virtual machine

00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:29,879
image in what like 15 seconds and it's

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,469
booting right now a bit slow because

00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:32,190
it's cream um you don't have KVM or

00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:34,320
something like that

00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:38,279
but after a few more seconds it should

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,200
boot a completely working system and you

00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,109
can reconfigure it you can put default

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,919
users you can enable services in

00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:49,559
Sprint's tour packages and it's just a

00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,239
shell scripting with some helpers which

00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:54,479
I wrote so it should be fairly easy to

00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:57,359
reuse extend and so on and it should

00:30:54,479 --> 00:31:01,080
also work for a MIDI devices I didn't

00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,580
play with it so much yet for like

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,049
targeting Alma whatever but it should

00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,739
just work

00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:11,519
I'm not running any binary from the root

00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:13,229
even for installing packages so

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,719
hopefully it's going to be really to

00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:17,339
boot now yes so it switches to visa mode

00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:20,369
because I configured it this way in boot

00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:25,139
config in my recipe and they see is made

00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:27,029
with d6 one from HP SD right now and as

00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:32,429
you can see it should start in it

00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:39,450
in the second yes and it should give me

00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:43,979
a prompt okay my computer is a bit slow

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:45,359
I'm sorry that's like okay it doesn't

00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:50,009
good when to user right now that's not

00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:54,259
supposed to happen figure so there is a

00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:54,259
fail but I swear that it actually works

00:31:55,339 --> 00:31:58,339
okay

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:08,750
next time use more preparation so back

00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:10,390
to the slides now moving on to the goals

00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:14,059
of the project what we want to achieve

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:17,419
after this first year of activity well

00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:21,760
more more security it's one of my main

00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:25,760
areas personally I do this as a living

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,649
security consultant I want to have also

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,440
left of touring base for instance maybe

00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:31,789
replace in it like Jordan mention also

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,440
during the keynote it's an idea that I

00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:36,260
have in mind for quite a while now and

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,669
we have lots and lots of ideas it's

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:41,470
always easier to have ideas than

00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:44,929
actually doing them but yeah it's it's

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:48,139
working progress there's been some

00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:50,899
progress so where to find us

00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:55,070
not surprisingly on IRC we have a

00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:57,169
website HPC dot org we have two mailing

00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,389
lists as I mentioned earlier this is to

00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:01,789
reach me directly and hopefully you're

00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:06,409
not sleeping right now so I'd be very

00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:08,570
happy to see you join and have a look or

00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:11,029
like say it's cool because it's always

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:13,940
nice when people say it's cool and thank

00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:14,299
you for attention today hope to talk to

00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,110
you later

00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:19,250
to NASA tech if you have any questions

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,460
anything more I could show how much time

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:26,679
do I have

00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:29,299
okay did I speak too fast okay cool so

00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,250
if you can see it right here it's a

00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:35,059
screen saver that I wrote using the

00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:39,380
default gnome background which slightly

00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:40,580
slides to the bottom right and there is

00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,090
a net BSD logo on top of that

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,919
transparency with transparency so if I

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,559
don't touch the screen right now it

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,620
gives me a point where I can slide like

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,200
this singing here to unlock and it gives

00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,730
me my desktop so like it would be on a

00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,919
regular phone or whatever I can also set

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:01,490
a password instead or anything it's just

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,899
to plug in like plugins so here you have

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,210
the main menu I can configure it here

00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:07,220
but of course everything can be modified

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,369
I can go to the settings of the panel

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,060
and I can say okay which app lets go on

00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:13,129
which panel

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,870
I have a bunch of different applets this

00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:17,840
one tracks the Bluetooth stereos

00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,040
there is the assist tray here a window

00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,379
to come in a button right now to

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,970
conveniently close applications because

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:25,970
usually they don't have like the window

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,300
bar from because matchbox doesn't have

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,440
one

00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:34,370
I can also like pop up a virtual

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,800
keyboard normally come on yes so I have

00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:40,190
a virtual keyboard here with different

00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,820
layouts I can switch it's not always

00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:46,580
very convenient but it works I can run

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:49,510
the manager which is OB which I show we

00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:52,730
showed before I can run normally the

00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,860
camera application which looks like

00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,980
looks like this I should even be able to

00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,150
running it fullscreen I'm not in this

00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,840
version but since then I have

00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,700
incremented it maybe if i press this yes

00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:10,100
so right now it's okay scaling really

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:14,150
badly but I have another mode you can

00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,870
see yourself that's awesome I can even

00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,340
take a picture

00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,780
it doesn't make noise right now when you

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:22,100
take what I take pictures but it should

00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:23,270
be easy to to achieve so yeah here I

00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:31,220
have my souvenir

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:33,380
maybe yes I have a girl reallocation

00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,880
like on my phone and it starts

00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,950
automatically automatically the family

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,370
enjoy in a white folder like this yeah

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:42,650
I'm like on a regular phone camera and

00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:46,580
here you can see yourself and I can go

00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:50,570
into the preview plug-in where is it

00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,550
here and if I press edit it should start

00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,640
 if I configured it or something

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:58,520
like that maybe I didn't or I can view

00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,730
it like in a image viewer like this so

00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,860
here you are so I'm really trying to

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,230
like gather the whole user experience

00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:09,940
from regular devices into this

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:12,770
environment and it's not so bad I

00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:16,640
believe and of course if you need there

00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:18,200
is always a terminal this one is

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,930
actually exterminated into a gtk

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,750
plication and you can create new tabs

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:24,640
with X term inside

00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,220
you can ASSU run in eighty vixtorm of

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,030
course and so on and so forth I mean

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:35,070
it's it's all open don't know what else

00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:37,060
I can show that's interesting yeah

00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:40,660
basically that's that's it for the

00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:43,300
tablet I can show the phone here because

00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,280
it's now booting in a loop so it's

00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:49,360
actually booting that VSD from time to

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:53,380
time let's see if it has enough battery

00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,180
to do a cold boot I have to do this a

00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,310
lot because every time I was checking

00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,440
like testing a new candle I had to

00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:03,430
remove the SD card and put on another

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,010
one with the new file so I had to do

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:08,830
this a lot it's not nice for the

00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:12,490
hardware part of this is broken now from

00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:18,330
using it too much but if I've done the

00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:18,330
phone no student happy is to charge more

00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,640
yeah and I brought the driver for the

00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,410
keypad which was a bit of a mess I mean

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,090
difficult to achieve I didn't have much

00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:31,870
experience with um development at that

00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:35,440
point but though like gory details or in

00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:37,060
my bsd can talk and the keyboard works

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,380
it just takes one second right now each

00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,680
time you press a key to actually appear

00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:44,440
on screen but this should be possible to

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,230
fix to improve and when booting so right

00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,770
now the layout is wrong so it's still

00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:51,130
not really usable even with the keyboard

00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,370
right now

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,960
sorry it's starting now there is a small

00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:59,380
Linux penguin but it's actually from you

00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,580
boot it's not Linux and default

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,180
I changed the bootloader that's why it

00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:07,780
does that and with this bootloader I can

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:09,730
start and an end SD elf kernel like it's

00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:13,240
built automatically and like it's built

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:15,160
from the regular sources and you can see

00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,500
here the console with green on white and

00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,000
it's actually ended BSD booting and if

00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,060
you're very patient you can actually get

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,350
it get to see it multi-user and

00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:30,130
sometimes it starts X I also wrote are

00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:32,410
some simple drivers for like the camera

00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,859
cover at the back so I can detect these

00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,700
Evan

00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:39,960
I can detect the button pushes here and

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:43,480
a couple other things the camera button

00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,099
yeah so this sort of works I've been

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,710
trying to get the touchscreen and

00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:51,640
wireless driver to work they are both on

00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:53,619
the spi bus and when you write at the

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,239
same time the bus driver and the actual

00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:57,430
device driver is difficult to know while

00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,529
your bug is which is why I would love to

00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,359
have a simulator ought to have another

00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:03,999
device with a known working SPI bus

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:07,059
driver and then I could like plug

00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:08,650
something else but yeah so did it crash

00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:10,509
or yeah I guess it did there is a

00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,400
watchdog or so in the bootloader or in

00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:14,980
the window like in the hardware which is

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,920
not implemented by net BSD yet so if you

00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:21,099
don't disable this somehow when you boot

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,109
the device automatically itself reboots

00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:25,779
right now but there are ways to work

00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:27,210
around that apparently this time I

00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:30,730
didn't

00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,869
so yeah that's for the 900 hopefully

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:36,849
more hardware is going to be working

00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:41,680
soon but that's what I had and yeah I

00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:50,470
guess I used most of the 10 minutes by

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:52,619
now ok well I would like a drink thank

00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,619
you

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,860
