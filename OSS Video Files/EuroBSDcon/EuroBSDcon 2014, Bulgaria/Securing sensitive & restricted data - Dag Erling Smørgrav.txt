Description: 
	Abstract:

Researchers in many scientific fields routinely work with sensitive or restricted data such as patient records, human genetic sequences, or interviews with dissidents in oppressive regimes. Keeping this data secure while retaining the ability to process and analyse it is a non-trivial problem. The University of Oslo’s TSD service is a “walled garden” environment for storing and processing this type of data. We present the architecture of TSD and describe how FreeBSD is used to control the interface between TSD and the world.
