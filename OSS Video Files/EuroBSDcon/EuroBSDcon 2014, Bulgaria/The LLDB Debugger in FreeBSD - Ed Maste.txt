Description: 
	Abstract:

LLDB is a modern, high-performance debugger in the LLVM family of projects, and is built as a modular and reusable set of components on top of the Clang/LLVM foundation. It was originally developed for Mac OS X, but now supports FreeBSD and Linux as well, with ongoing work for Windows support.This presentation will provide an overview of the design of LLDB, compare it with the existing GNU debugger in the FreeBSD base system, and present the path to importing LLDB as FreeBSD’s debugger.
