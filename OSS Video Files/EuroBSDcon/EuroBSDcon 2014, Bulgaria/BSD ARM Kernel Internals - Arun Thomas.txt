Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Abstract:

In this talk, I’ll discuss how BSD kernels interface with the ARM processor. I will cover the kernel internals of the FreeBSD and NetBSD ARM ports, focusing primarily on ARMv7.I will discuss how booting, memory management, exceptions, and interrupts work, using plenty of BSD code. This talk is meant to be a quick start guide for BSD hackers who aren’t familiar with the ARM architecture.
