thank you very much

00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,700
datian

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:27,750
I'm not BSD developer I'm computational

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:33,059
linguist first and second freelance

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:38,360
journalist so my talk will be much more

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:40,440
relaxed technique much more relaxed

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,879
technically speaking because I'm a

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:48,440
journalist and I will speak about

00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:51,290
technology applied to modern

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,780
investigative methods in journalism

00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:58,500
including working with anonymous sources

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,840
of information and using technology to

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,129
protect the services and to receive

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:10,619
anonymously documents I'm representing

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:14,880
here my website vivo dot B G which is an

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,800
investigative outlet and also I'm a

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,590
spokesman of Balkan leaks which is one

00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,509
of the systems used to receive

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:29,000
anonymously documents so we have seen in

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:33,950
last year's many cases of critical

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,770
whistleblowing information coming from

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:44,479
from various sources and we all we know

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:51,420
like journalists that this is one of the

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:56,060
crucial if info information sources for

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,670
official officials misconduct it's

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,209
bringing light to criminal behavior

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:09,630
especially in corrupted countries it's

00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:12,209
bringing information collaborating other

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,030
investigative reporters is because it is

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:19,640
we cannot rely only on whistleblowing of

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:23,700
course and generally it whistle blows

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:30,390
acting to protect the public interest so

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:33,739
we have seen that examples coming from

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:37,409
WikiLeaks examples coming from from

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:39,480
lastly from Snowden that the technology

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:45,349
protection and the law protection is

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:49,939
also very important to to keep going

00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:57,959
those leaks which which which are not

00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:58,980
yes there is a kind of war against

00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:11,700
whistleblowers

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:17,939
to attacked by by officials by NSA by

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:21,590
CIA by Russians Chinese and any kind of

00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:25,739
secret services you can imagine so but

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:30,090
journalists are also on the feet you

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:35,069
know the case of blanking vote from The

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:39,120
Guardian who was investigated by for his

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:41,430
collaboration with with adults Norden we

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,360
have many local cases including Kim

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,040
Bulgaria you know

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,030
big scandal involving snooping of

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,420
communications of politicians and

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:59,690
journalists the so-called gallery'

00:03:52,420 --> 00:04:08,960
scandal so we we also need to develop

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:13,010
this locally not only on global scale

00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,320
another simple to understand advantage

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:19,209
of whistleblowing is that compared to

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:23,859
Freedom of Information Act requests is -

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,859
that it's much more difficult to get

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,230
documents exposing official corruption

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,130
so by Freedom of Information Act because

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:42,800
in in a country like Bulgaria fo which

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:45,020
is unfortunately they unfortunately

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
institutions are closed to citizens it

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,640
takes years to take to get a document

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,270
for example we had a case with the

00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:57,919
customs to take the so-called Michou the

00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:00,650
beer case documents it took took us two

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,990
years long judicial case and many and

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,570
money of course to pay to get this

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,400
document finally it will take two

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:12,710
minutes to whistleblower to to submit

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:15,380
the same thing so there are many

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:19,250
challenges to anonymous electronic

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:23,330
submission it should be secure because

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:27,140
it's even more dangerous than to send a

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:30,310
letter by you know you know a bomb

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:34,820
envelope because everything is trace

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:37,970
traceable now our days so it must resist

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,250
traceability provide strong committee

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,880
security and to be user-friendly and

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,360
this is very important because people

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:50,990
who

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:54,870
ready to give evidence not technically

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:59,370
skilled usually so you cannot ask him to

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:04,020
and unclipped to learn PGP to encrypt

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:07,220
the document and to send it by encrypted

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:12,060
mail you have to provide something

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:16,560
simpler to to do to the people so we

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:20,400
know of course about other classic oh

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:27,259
and old systems like crypto me online

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:31,979
from 96 it's almost 20 years and

00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:37,319
supporting submissions by email

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:40,590
PGP of course now they moved to to the

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:44,940
same system we use then was the classic

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:51,240
I I named it classic system because it

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:53,599
had all the features of actual modern

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,840
[Music]

00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:03,389
systems for anonymous submissions but

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,229
unfortunately it disappeared so

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:14,699
WikiLeaks started at all submission

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:18,360
system and it had a lot of interesting

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,240
features including cover traffic but

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,250
when Julian Assange and Daniel

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:30,280
domscheit-berg splitted

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:34,080
the architect of the system shut it down

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:40,600
and WikiLeaks stopped receiving

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:45,730
submissions and this system was closed

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:47,730
so sauce designed by a single person so

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:53,800
it worked the following way

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:57,040
whistleblower is sending documents to

00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,300
talk to a hidden server so the

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,470
information is never travelling through

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:11,070
[Music]

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:13,210
open Internet and to the right for the

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,270
security that was a cover traffic

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:20,950
generated between the workstation and

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:23,320
the first node of the talk system so if

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:27,430
he was listening to the communications

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:34,270
you cannot tell where at what moment

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:40,830
exactly the the leak is is traveling you

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:48,360
know through the network so then we had

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:55,630
this rapper wire coming from result from

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:57,640
open open leaks which never worked it

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:02,760
was a promise but it never it never

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:07,660
actually appeared and many followers of

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:13,589
WikiLeaks including Balkan leaks written

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:18,210
nice list of sites receiving clicks but

00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:22,770
the problem is was that I got no leaks

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:27,460
so Balkan leaks was one of the few who

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:28,670
has submissions locally important and

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,209
even

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:42,230
sound recognize that it's one of the

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:45,709
most successful copycats so we we had we

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:48,950
I think the reason of this success was

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:51,170
first to adopt immediately the same

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,089
model of submitting Kannamma sexual talk

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,430
and second to work closely with

00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:59,959
journalists it's it's a system designed

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:05,470
by journalists and they ask to IT to

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,470
help and to to a person

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,470
well to me to represent to be the

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:18,350
spokesman simply because I'm living

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:23,899
abroad so it's it's harder for to be

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:25,430
under pressure in Bulgaria so closely

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,320
working with journalists is very

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:36,130
important to for the success of such

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:36,130
such a system and it's not it's probably

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:44,060
best seen in the model developed by New

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:47,510
York Times by Forbes by other big media

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:51,290
outlets they design their own submission

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:57,230
on anonymously anonymous submission

00:10:51,290 --> 00:11:04,300
system and and they use the same model

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:08,510
now so we we had some success stories

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:12,260
including information about Masonic

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:14,449
Lodge in the judicial system it's a big

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,339
problem because of course judges had to

00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:20,480
be impartial and they are not we got

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,170
confidential documents about the Ballon

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,779
a nuclear power plant

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:33,350
we got leaks about the criminal past of

00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:34,970
former prime minister and a lot of other

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,170
stuff you can see it on the website

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,510
and we we are very proud because we were

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,029
censored

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,750
by the Council of Europe when we exposed

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,860
our world

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:51,910
last year they decided not to publish

00:11:47,860 --> 00:12:01,540
the video because we talked we presented

00:11:51,910 --> 00:12:04,420
very sensitive stuff so this is our big

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:08,190
achievement to be censored by you know

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,190
the guardians of this free speech so

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:19,680
technically speaking we we started using

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:23,260
secure drop last year secure drop is our

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,769
instructs final project before he he

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:33,250
died it's supported by freedom of the

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:41,339
press foundation and it's based on top

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:41,339
and using PGP encryption and among the

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:50,069
media outlets who adopted secure appear

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:54,130
at the New York we have Forbes and

00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:59,370
others too it's an open source of course

00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:03,100
and it's written in Python language

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:09,120
secured up architecture is a bit

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,120
complicated but for journalists but

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,410
the security of freedom of the freedom

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:20,210
of the press foundation provides

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:23,310
installation and teaching to journalists

00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:28,170
so if you start from scratch you can

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:33,950
call them and they will talk to you to

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:37,290
help you to set up your servers and

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,700
there are teaching sessions - for

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,870
journalists to learn how to work with

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:45,890
PGP and so on so the whistleblower is

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:49,730
hidden here well of course he has to be

00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:55,290
so he's talking he's submitting to to

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:57,960
sue talk to the application server where

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:01,080
files are encrypted in memory in RAM and

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,490
stored on the disk there is a monitoring

00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:08,310
server separated monitoring server

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:13,650
sending an email to the journalist when

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:16,050
he when a new leak is detected then the

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:18,690
journalist connects with workstation an

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,420
ordinary workstation but suto to the

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:26,160
application server and retrieves the

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:28,410
files but he cannot open he have not he

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,320
has to follow the guidelines not to open

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:35,860
the files on his exposed workstation but

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:40,700
to move them on a USB

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,790
drive to to a laptop air-gapped

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,810
workstation running tales secure

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:54,400
operating system so the laptop is the

00:14:47,810 --> 00:15:01,640
place where actual reading of the

00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:09,260
documents or cure so this is the

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:14,870
securing model is very strict and also

00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:17,960
it it is it is expensive because for a

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:21,050
small organization there is a problem of

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:27,380
affordability we need 2 servers get

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:31,370
laptop it costs around 3 $3,000 we need

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,110
also competent IT staff even if freedom

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:40,720
of the press foundation provides

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:43,850
training and also training for using

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,450
people who are technically curious

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,630
tweedle learn to how to use PGP how to

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:57,980
decrypt and keep team for information

00:15:49,630 --> 00:16:00,560
and - well - - using of course using

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:05,180
talk the talk about which is the

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,780
probably the easiest part so now there

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:11,900
is an ongoing fundraising campaign by

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:15,070
including balkan leagues is one of the

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:19,640
selected organizations who receive

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:23,020
probably hardware for implementing the

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:27,940
next version of secure drop which is

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:30,890
expected to be to go public next month

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,080
there is also Tipton and Government

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:39,050
Accountability Project in

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:43,160
firedoglake.com we are as far as I know

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:46,089
we do the only European based

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,089
organization

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:55,640
using secure drop another system used by

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:07,490
Italian and Hungarian media is Global

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:10,170
leaks global leaks is a concurrent

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:16,920
secure drop but we started to using it

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:21,890
but very fast we discover and we want

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,890
that there are security issues which

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,520
which are very serious so we decided to

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:33,270
stop using it and even though it's a

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,710
very flexible system not much more

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:41,640
flexible than strongbox but it's much

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,530
it's much more complicated the code is

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,060
there there is a lot of code so big

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:53,430
spikes weeks attacking space for Globo

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:58,560
leaks secure drop is tighter and well

00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:03,870
audited by secure security experts like

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:08,070
Schneider Jacob Appelbaum and others so

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:12,050
we dropped support for global leaks and

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:17,250
we're working now only with secure

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:19,580
secure drop waiting to to see the

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:24,450
futures we need for example we need to

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:26,970
to receive leaks that which will be

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,380
routed to competent journalists if

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:34,730
before the leak is described as

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:38,940
financial data we need to send it to to

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:42,740
the journalist who is and savvy which

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,530
financial that end and if it's it's

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:55,770
energy

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:58,620
sector or organized crime data we have

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:02,550
to give it to the right person and for

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:07,440
now we have to decide after we read the

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:15,540
data - who will be the best person to

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:19,680
work with this material well so far so

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:22,920
good we have the leaks but then comes

00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,830
the after leak time and it's not easy -

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:30,740
because we got the mega leak or we got

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:34,430
the mega fire data and now what we have

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:39,570
hundreds if not millions of documents

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:41,490
and it we have to build the system which

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,310
will comprehensively index those

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:52,050
documents and allow us to search inside

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:58,560
searching emails searching PDFs any kind

00:19:52,050 --> 00:20:00,900
of data so we had such experience and

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:06,360
every time we had to build a custom

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:11,180
parser for this kind of data then we use

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:15,380
the Sphinx indexer - to make the

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:21,240
interface for searching the data and

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:26,390
depending on if this is open to public

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:30,270
or not we use hidden top services

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:33,810
service to browse the date we've called

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:39,060
secured with password and and even

00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:42,030
better with tor are see a spatial

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:45,980
distribution we give to the rent from

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:50,600
with tales to

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:55,180
to be sure that this did only one person

00:20:50,600 --> 00:21:01,640
or only few persons can access this date

00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:04,490
so we have also to to solve the problem

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,250
of sharing and searching in the

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:14,390
sensitive material searching encrypted

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:16,670
date we have some case studies for

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,550
examples we built a searchable database

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:24,650
of solid citation and the world notices

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:29,900
from US government obtained by the

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:33,350
sunlight foundation and this is used by

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:37,250
many journalists around the world to see

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:39,770
who is the organizations in their

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:45,220
country who received grants from the US

00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,220
government and the original data was in

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:56,600
CSV format and it was something like 400

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:58,760
gig gig gigabytes so you see it you

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,710
cannot give this to journalists they

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,630
don't know what to do with this you have

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:08,140
to build the search engine and to give

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:19,750
them the interface to look inside so I

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:19,750
will try to open it switching call

00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:26,580
okay so the another case study is

00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,419
searchable database of leaked emails

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:34,440
from one party so called basic pair

00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:39,840
leaks exposing a lot of cases of

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:43,529
corruption misuse and so on so we got we

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,809
got an inbox many inboxes actually in an

00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:49,859
box format and we had to export the

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:53,729
emails and to build to index them with

00:22:49,859 --> 00:23:03,259
strings and build building this search

00:22:53,729 --> 00:23:06,019
engine another - we develop is a

00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:09,919
JavaScript based and keep the data

00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:14,249
searching - we call the project mahalia

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,960
it has a specific meaning in Bulgarian -

00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:21,059
to run after me Hollett means you're

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:28,889
losing your time for nothing so if you

00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:31,950
if you try to break - this system is

00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:38,220
open I mean it can be installed anywhere

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:41,700
it's just encrypted file soft - HTML but

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:46,409
you there is no way because it's

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:49,349
encrypted to know what the what kind of

00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:59,070
searches you do and what kind of

00:23:49,349 --> 00:24:01,669
information you you have and it's it's

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:05,639
an interesting concept because it use

00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:09,239
it's a JavaScript based search engine

00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:11,309
you on the web on the server side you

00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:15,659
have only files index files and data

00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:24,570
files and all the logic is implemented

00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:28,029
in and in the browser including well the

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:32,250
encryption engine which is probably not

00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:40,000
the best solution but for working with

00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:44,080
in well sharing they did this was the

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:51,240
only thing we could we found to work

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:55,210
remotely from different locations and to

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:58,960
to have a search and search engine and

00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:05,799
sharing facilities and sharing encrypted

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:13,380
information to so it's an open source of

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:18,370
course you can find it on github and the

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:21,520
search is working this way you you send

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:25,990
the words you send a request to the

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:36,090
server to find encrypt it words you

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:36,090
retrieve the indexes then the indexes

00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:42,520
give you the list of documents where the

00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:47,649
words are found and at the second step

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:53,830
when you click on the link you retrieve

00:25:47,649 --> 00:26:01,870
the date and this happens in the browser

00:25:53,830 --> 00:26:05,020
so the data process is using the local

00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:07,049
storage to when you work on the text and

00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:15,190
you have to redact names for example

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:20,500
clear some sensitive data which which is

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:27,650
not you are not allowed to publish for

00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:30,970
example quickly deleting the names of

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:35,779
individuals who can be hurt

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:41,570
so you have to save your work you save

00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:50,980
it encrypt it in local storage and you

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:58,750
can then send only the ID of the

00:26:50,980 --> 00:27:04,700
document to two other journalists and

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:09,140
you can send them we had such a custom

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:12,020
Firefox modified to work with big local

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:17,240
storage and having all the database

00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:20,539
inside because you can La Costa which is

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:29,149
limited to 10 Meg's but we managed to

00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:35,350
work with 500 megabytes a portable

00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:36,500
Firefox on USB Drive so you give this

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,049
it's

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:44,679
air-gapped and you work with with this

00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:44,679
locally with with the modified documents

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:51,610
so this this is one of the

00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:03,150
the systems we we want to develop

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:03,150
further to make possible searches with

00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:11,980
now we have simple word search we want

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:16,600
to make logical searches like and or

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:20,170
exclude and so on and to provide easy

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,090
interface to encrypt data because the

00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:31,500
the actual interface is written in Peru

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:31,500
and we want to build it in old GS j s2

00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:38,890
and to distribute a package

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,670
so people who journalist who need to

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:45,640
share sensitive material they can

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:56,470
uncoded they can index it and encrypt it

00:28:45,640 --> 00:29:01,330
themselves so other perspectives we have

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:04,810
to to address this you know the single

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:14,490
point of failure problem because even if

00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:14,490
you use secure drop you the storages is

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:22,080
on a given place and if you are victim

00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:34,510
of attack

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:39,910
you can simply lose your data so we want

00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:49,840
to extend secure drop with distributed

00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:55,510
storage using Tahoe they see as and we

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:59,500
have some progress on this side but it's

00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:05,740
not yet ready to be distributed and

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:08,260
another interesting document can such an

00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,960
conception I strongly advise you to read

00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:14,830
this from Delhi and our who would with

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:20,820
us on this mahalia system and also to

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:25,380
secure our installation he wrote about

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:31,000
possible distributed infrastructure for

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:35,550
leaks using DHT and and this is very

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:44,710
interesting concept but we like time and

00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:52,810
people to develop on this ok so let me

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:58,360
show you here we have this is the search

00:30:52,810 --> 00:31:02,590
engine for the solicitation and the

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:06,210
world notices notices so we search for a

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:14,710
country you have a list of documents of

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:26,910
all kind of grants awarded by US

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:34,750
government you have this possible leaks

00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:46,390
search engine which gives a link to a

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:48,970
static HTML generated by hipper mail so

00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:52,890
here is the encryption that's bad

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,890
let me see if I can move it

00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:20,779
no way okay let's me let's try a search

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:24,409
here not found don't you you can explore

00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:29,240
it at Bachmann leaks not a slash me

00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:40,419
mahalia the password is test test so you

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:43,389
enter the system and I search for audio

00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:45,740
just want to show you how it works with

00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:50,299
encrypted audio it's the clipped it

00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:54,980
locally also it works with PDF files and

00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:56,960
with images of course and of course we

00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,629
text so here you see the indexes

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,389
retrieved it's it's the book the book to

00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:05,570
to see what how many documents you you

00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:07,970
retrieve so those are the documents

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:13,809
retrieved from the web server to perform

00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,809
the search ok and to display the results

00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:32,330
you can find this on github course and

00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:35,659
let me show you how we work with the

00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:42,470
submission system secure drop so the

00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:46,370
table router gives onion address here so

00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:50,500
we open this onion address your the

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,500
whistleblower actually

00:33:54,810 --> 00:34:05,340
so if it's your first time sending

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:09,220
documents you click here you have unique

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,400
code name - you have to copy it if you

00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,169
want to read the answers by the

00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:17,500
journalists because the system is two

00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:20,140
ways communications between the

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:25,960
whistleblower and the journalist if you

00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:30,940
want to have more data some some details

00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:36,669
on the submission you can contact do so

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:41,230
blow if you want so so you copy the code

00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:43,510
then you continue you here you can put

00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:49,500
or copy/paste a message here you can

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:55,600
send a file and you are submitting this

00:34:49,500 --> 00:35:02,130
so the file is now submitted and you can

00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:06,250
close the browser and and run away from

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:09,480
from the place you are where you are so

00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:14,730
the for example the global league system

00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:17,500
is using different logic and it takes

00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:22,500
twice the time to make to make a

00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,500
submission because it's asking for some

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:29,350
asking questions about what kind of

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,410
submission you are sending the category

00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,790
and so on and this is no good because

00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:39,180
when you when you are whistleblower

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:39,180
you're stressed and you have to be

00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,820
comfortable with the system that it's

00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:51,100
not asking too much for me I'll just

00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:55,390
send it and forget about it ok so from

00:35:51,100 --> 00:36:00,390
the journal site we have another tour

00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:06,740
instance you connect with the password

00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:15,440
which is written in the Torah see file

00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:17,860
and we because we know how to use it we

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,840
use tables we are not asking to

00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:25,480
whistleblowers to use tales because it's

00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:32,720
too much too restrictive you have to

00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:37,910
burn your system on a USB Drive or DVD

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:47,780
and and so on but for for to retrieve

00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:55,580
the data we use tales okay so we had we

00:36:47,780 --> 00:37:01,280
have of course other sources

00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:03,730
we are working with classic source is

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,730
meeting people

00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:15,220
not everything received is usable

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,869
because we have a lot of fakes and the

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:23,510
journalistic work on non the leaks is

00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:26,350
very you have to be very careful because

00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:29,330
sometimes you receive data which is not

00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:35,390
which is real we have you have to check

00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:39,050
twice and and and and - so here - you

00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:43,540
submit these to experts to verify to

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:45,760
corroborate of course before you

00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:49,000
you cannot publish if you are not sure

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:56,400
hundred persons that what what you see

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,400
is a hero League and not and not

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:06,610
something fake so thank you

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:12,790
we're still running for the next big

00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:15,460
league and you have questions one

00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:18,550
announcement before the questions there

00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,410
will be no break after this talk we will

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:29,260
start the closing session immediately

00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:37,390
after the questions so go ahead it's a

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:47,740
picture from where a person was

00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:52,300
intercepted by the police so yes a

00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:55,540
really simple question the whatsapp you

00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:59,440
show is the the real one to drop

00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:02,620
documents and talking about user comfort

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,260
and I'm not very sure people are Rea

00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:07,390
comfortable if you were trying to push

00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:12,010
documents to you they open a website

00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:26,290
with a big logo on the top saying hey

00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:29,080
I'm sending documents yes I imagine

00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:33,130
someone sending documents someone comes

00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:35,980
on the desk is trying to push the

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,710
windows to the other side or minimize it

00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:42,240
but we have on the top I'm waking

00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,240
documents from the inside

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:55,160
is to provide some innocent title for

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:57,890
example my my vacation in Greece or

00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:02,660
something like this you know which we

00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:04,190
changes dynamically for at every window

00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:08,860
you open this is a good idea or

00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:26,270
something like a regular website like

00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:28,340
New York Times or okay you mentioned the

00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:30,920
two-way communication system secure

00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:39,020
drops drop provides how many people use

00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:43,540
it actually no I mean how how often do

00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,540
you have to get back to someone who yes

00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:58,370
I have only one such case in my practice

00:40:51,170 --> 00:41:01,070
but I cannot speak for the others let's

00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:06,380
say from five weeks

00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:15,200
only one person exchanged information

00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:18,050
further yeah this is yeah well it's not

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:24,560
the surprise because you're increasing

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:26,180
the risk if you come back to to be

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,690
talking to the journalist you have to

00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,950
keep the code

00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,950
very comfortable

00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:49,270
okay so thank you

00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:56,910
[Applause]

00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,910
