Title: Let’s make manuals more useful, part 2 - Ingo Schwarze
Publication date: 2019-10-13
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2014, Bulgaria
Description: 
	Who should take this course:

This course is intended for the following audiences. For each group, the topic numbers that will be of the most immediate interest are listed, but the other topics are likely to be useful as well.

Software developers, since no software is complete without documentation – in particular, but not limited to, developers of publicly available, portable software. (1, 2, 3, 4, 0)
Operating system developers, since all operating system development and maintenance includes keeping the system’s native documentation, and the tools handling it, up to date. (5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 0)
Porters, that is, people porting software to a given operating system and providing ports and packages. Such work usually requires dealing with a wide variety of documentation formats. (6, 7, 3, 2, 4)
Documentation developers, that is, people specifically working on software manuals, even if they are not developing the software itself. (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)
System administrators, to understand how documentation is written, built, installed, and indexed for searching, to help troubleshooting and supporting their users. (6, 2, 4, 1, 7)
Some end users of computers running BSD operating systems may also find the course interesting to better understand how to use documentation search and display tools and to get some background on how these tools, and documentation formatting and installation in general, works. (4, 0, 1, 7)
Attendants are expected to have basic experience using the command-line user interface of UNIX-like operating systems. Basic experience in programming and system administration may help understanding a few points, but is not required. Prior knowledge about documentation formatting and processing tools is not required, but doesn’t hurt either.

Ingo Schwarze will try to keep the content accessible for newcomers to the field of documentation formatting, but to also cover the newest developments and tools that specialists in the field will be interested in.

If participants drop Ingo Schwarze a mail beforehand to, preferably right after registering, stating their background and/or what they are most interested in, he can use such information to tune the course content towards the audience.

Description:

Manual pages have been a resource of critical importance in UNIX for more than 40 years, since Version 1 AT&T UNIX. The steady evolution of the mandoc toolbox during the last six years allows to leverage the various strengths of the concept much better than in the past and to deliver more useful documentation.
(0) The course will start with a brief introduction explaining what these strengths are, and providing some historical background.
After that, it will teach:

(1) How to get started using the mdoc(7) formatting language for writing new software manuals, how to do so without spending too much time learning the language, and which resources to use while working on mdoc(7) manuals.
(2) How to make sure that mdoc(7)-based documentation in a portable software distribution is portable, using the mandoc(1) -Tman output mode and the ./configure mechanism.
(3) How to support quality control of existing manuals using mandoc(1) – Tlint and other tools.
At about this point, there will be a working phase with hands-on exercises.

(4) How to use the mandoc-based apropos(1) search tool and how to build its databases with makewhatis(8).
(5) How to effectively integrate mandoc(1) as a manual formatter and manual page search system into the base system of a BSD operating system and what to pay attention to while doing so
(6) How to effectively use mandoc(1) as a manual formatter and manual page search system in a porting and packaging framework, and what to do about manuals that require groff(1) for correct formatting.
(7) Which next steps are recommended for the major BSD systems: OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFly, …
Depending on what Ingo Schwarze gets done in mandoc development during the summer, he is likely to add one or two surprise topics to the course showing the latest developments.

Speaker biography:

Ingo Schwarze has been an OpenBSD user since 2001 and a developer
since 2009. He maintains the OpenBSD in-tree mandoc since making
it the only documentation formatter in the base system in 2009/2010.
He also maintains the portable mandoc distribution since 2013 and
the OpenBSD groff(1) port since 2010 and has contributed to various
parts of the OpenBSD userland, for example the Perl rewrite of the
security(8) script, as well as smaller contributions to man(1), to
the rc.d(8) framework, the yp(8) subsystem, the C library, and
various other programs. Outside the free software world, he studied
physics in Siegen/Germany and worked as a researcher in elementary
particle physics at CERN and at the University of Karlsruhe (KIT),
and as a Perl programmer for Sophos UTM.

	00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:17,400
or all manuals that refer to a certain

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:19,949
error constant such search Keys can even

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,730
be combined so if you don't know exactly

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,099
whether it will be a function type or a

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,220
variable type or a function argument

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,579
your search term will show up in you

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,290
just give multiple macro names and

00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:37,620
search for the same keywords and all of

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,980
them at the same time if you don't know

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,989
at all what kind of thing you are

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,329
searching for how it might be marked up

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:50,489
you can use you can search across all

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:53,430
the search Keys remember if you don't

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:57,840
supply this any then it just searches in

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,850
the title line in if you supply the any

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,589
then it searches in everything that's

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,680
mucked up in any way you can even use

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:14,369
regular expressions if you exchange the

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:18,060
equal sign by a tilde then it uses

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:23,580
regular expressions for for searching in

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:27,659
those keys you can construct complex

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:33,900
search queries for example here I'm

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:40,500
saying I want to see all section 1

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:46,009
manuals that either contain TBL in the

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:51,210
title line or contain a name equally Q n

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:54,320
obviously I'm interested in in graph

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,030
extensions and it shows me a list of of

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,600
matches but only from the from the

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,229
matching section so terms are you joined

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,970
with oh and if you specify a section

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:11,300
with minus X its appended with with end

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,270
you can also make the the end Oro

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,450
explicit like and find

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:23,210
you can even use parentheses to group it

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:27,870
so for example here I'm saying I want

00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:31,680
section 1 manuals having terminal as a

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:36,000
word in the in the title line but which

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,630
also have a mention of either research

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,810
UNIX or oat BSD so I want traditional

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:47,730
terminal tools and it gives me a did a

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,570
list of of tools that have been around

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:57,780
for a long time such stuff is working

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:59,880
basically since this year right in in

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,020
the meantime we can see that later or

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,780
even in the web interface that it works

00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,150
not only the input format so I've shown

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,960
so far has been improved but also the

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,830
output format

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,720
traditionally you always get the name

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,410
and the section of the manuals that

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,270
match because that's what you need here

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:25,320
this first column that's what you need

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:30,750
to to actually look at the manual with

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:34,680
man by default you would get here after

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:38,640
the - the title line but you can

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,709
explicitly request some other macro not

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,040
the antimatter or some other macro to be

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:48,060
shown for example here I'm saying I want

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,610
to see manuals having wireless in their

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,560
title line but I don't want to see the

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,150
title liner or you know that contains

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,340
wireless I want to see the configurator

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,989
no configuration directives from these

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:07,050
manuals so I can see on one with these

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,840
wireless adapters see at first sight

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,709
whether they attach a PCI or at Cottbus

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,450
or wherever with one command

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,239
traditionally I would have to do apropos

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,600
and then look with man at each of them

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,600
separately

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,340
and now we come to the surprise topic of

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:33,039
this talk it's a thing that wasn't

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,889
completed when I proposed the talk that

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:39,580
has been done really during the last two

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:42,280
or three months traditionally the

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,560
man-dog toolbox didn't include the man

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,990
program itself our philosophy was

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,490
Mardock is for formatting and man is for

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,889
displaying but we have changed that the

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,620
next man dog release will also contain

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,259
the man program so that all man dog man

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,550
apropos what is at the same user

00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:06,880
interface and they all do the same steps

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:10,389
now they first decide how to interpret

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,229
you command-line arguments then build a

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:16,419
list of matching matching manual pages

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,449
decide which kind of output provide to

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:21,909
you depending on your options

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:24,009
maybe spawn a pager and finally loop

00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:29,560
around the list of pages and produce

00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:33,909
some output for each of them let's look

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:37,449
at at the ways the the command-line

00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:39,849
arguments can be interpreted if you

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,500
specify the minus L option then the

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:44,469
command-line arguments are just

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:49,810
filenames so it takes each filename

00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:52,389
maybe formats it maybe shows it that's

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,949
the default operation mode for man doc

00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:59,529
as man doc always worked if you call it

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:02,319
as man in the default mode the

00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:04,810
command-line arguments are names of

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,960
manual pages so it looks up just like

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,210
traditional man did those names in the

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,380
file system and shows you the manual

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:18,690
pages if you use the F or argument it

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:23,830
use it does what what is used to do so

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:26,529
look as for names as complete words if

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:34,599
you use the minus K it supports the full

00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:35,450
apropos syntax what is new is that no

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,710
matter

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:42,440
which of the command names you use you

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,260
can always use all of them options so

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,600
you can even say what is - L and it

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,150
worked we work just as man dog so you

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,330
just need to remember one set of options

00:06:50,150 --> 00:07:01,430
all the traditional database selection

00:06:53,330 --> 00:07:04,390
options work with all the commands so to

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:08,660
show you one example

00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:14,630
probably just just do that out of the

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:24,850
presentation you yes probably good idea

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:24,850
let me see not there that's right

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,990
no still more

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,400
yeah

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:56,069
so usually you do something like oh no

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:56,069
that's a bad one I always get anything

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:04,569
usually I get a a manual just formatted

00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:19,870
for output on the terminal now with the

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:29,550
new tool I say man - t HTML HTML monkey

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:36,839
typing I get it formatted as HTML so I

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:45,699
put the links - standard in after it

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:47,649
here I have the manual as HTML Firefox

00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:51,570
doesn't work like that I think

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:57,970
no that was Firefox to do but anyway

00:08:51,570 --> 00:09:09,990
or another thing I say Apple pull em doc

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:13,029
I get a list of of manuals that match I

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,459
say app report which didn't work in the

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,740
past I give it enough output option that

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:20,740
was that was only supported by a man in

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:27,579
the past but not by apropos I get two

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:31,360
filenames man sorry

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:33,190
man - V Groff always worked you get the

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,949
file names instead of the formatted

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:41,350
pages now apropos - V also works so

00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:43,949
having all combinations of all options

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,800
is quite handy without having to

00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:51,970
remember something else for for each

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,069
command so these

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,230
these database selection options the

00:09:54,069 --> 00:10:01,350
traditional ones no work with with all

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:03,939
the commands the output options - a

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,240
doesn't show just the first manual

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:10,269
matching but all the manuals matching

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,000
one after the other so I could say I

00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:16,300
propose some keyword with - a and I get

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,389
all the metric manuals right away so

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:23,980
that in my in my last in my pager I can

00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:26,920
search through all of them - H is a

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:33,490
traditional option from man - just shows

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:39,970
the synopsis now also works with with

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:46,720
apropos I've already shown - - W to show

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:50,800
the the filenames and even even the

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:54,519
pawza informative output options now

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:59,860
work with all of them like for example

00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:02,740
what what is maybe relatively I guess

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:09,129
I've already shown an example with - TT

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:12,850
HTML and finally the the C output option

00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:17,009
to suppress the pager is all today

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:21,970
therefore all so that's the unified

00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:24,579
interface we now haven't a nice anecdote

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,089
about it is that a few months ago I

00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:30,279
presented in in Ottawa at BSD can and I

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:33,459
presented a list of things to do five or

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,589
six entries and this unified interface

00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:39,610
was not on the list I had no idea I

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:43,990
would do it but then on beginning of

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:46,750
August so about 6 or 7 weeks ago power

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:50,199
paulownia shock of alpine linux ask well

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:54,819
why don't you do man or do you do man

00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:57,759
and almost without thinking right

00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:00,959
I wanted to reply no we don't do that

00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,240
then I stopped and thought well why not

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,630
and realized the code was almost all

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,620
already there

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:12,319
I just had to reshuffle it a bit I

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:14,899
needed to do two releases first so it

00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:16,880
took about two weeks until it was

00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:20,240
finished from the from the idea on

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,660
August 9 first working version still in

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,110
the same month and then in August 26 I

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:31,399
did integrated and OpenBSD admittedly in

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:34,940
OpenBSD it's so far only integrated for

00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,829
Apple poor what is a hand doc man is

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:42,889
still the traditional tools some bugs

00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:46,190
need to be fixed there to not get too

00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:48,949
technical I will be a bit shorter on

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:53,269
these two slides one of the problems we

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:55,880
still have is what a name is you expect

00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:58,069
that when you say man something it shows

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,069
you the manual page for something so the

00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:03,980
manual page that is called something 4.1

00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:07,880
or so so the traditional man only looks

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:10,519
at fire names the new man looks for

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:14,240
names in more places like in the in the

00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,790
prologue that you just learned how to

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,920
write in the name section in the

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,790
synopsis section and all that will show

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:27,980
up as manuals in man now which can be

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:31,910
annoying for example I happen to have

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:37,699
the gnu coreutils installed now when i

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:40,670
tape man LS on OpenBSD i get the new LS

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:42,560
manual because it all has also has LS in

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,769
the name section that's obviously bad

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,550
and the thing I need to fix before we

00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:53,449
can enable that and there are there are

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:55,430
a few more things one very nice thing

00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:59,689
that Kristoff's did two or three years

00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:02,720
ago is a - I interactive option does the

00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:06,350
following you run an apropos command you

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,600
get a list of possible matches with

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,480
numbers in front and then you say ok I

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,209
want to see number 5 just type 5 enter

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,389
and get the manual page without going

00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:19,190
back to the shell in between and having

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:23,209
to retype the name

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,519
possibly mistyping it that will probably

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,589
be integrated but it's not done yet and

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,129
there are some problems with Mahon conf

00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:33,730
and so on I'll cut that here what is

00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:39,680
probably more interesting for you is

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:40,430
that it not only works on the at the

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,069
shell

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:49,100
typing interactively but you can also do

00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:57,740
the full power of this semantic complex

00:14:49,100 --> 00:15:02,540
and searches on the web so the the best

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:07,459
thing to explain that is probably a live

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:11,709
demo I have here yes oh let's do it a

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:11,709
different way I start from the OpenBSD

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:24,910
site I go to manual pages here right on

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:24,910
the OpenBSD page what's wrong with it

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,920
is that a problem with the network you

00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:37,920
always so this one works

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,850
what the hell

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,939
I don't understand okay something is

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:15,679
something is wrong with the network and

00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:17,360
I don't know what it is so we can try

00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,379
again later maybe after the working

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,519
phase I can try to do the demo again

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:30,889
right now let's just say just explain it

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,899
in words you can enter the same apropos

00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,970
searches you can enter at the command

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,670
line into the web interface or even if

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,399
you don't have OpenBSD installed you can

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:46,399
do the semantic searches for for manual

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:48,589
pages with all the with all the good

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,129
stuff I've shown before for the command

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:54,980
line and it it has a few additional

00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:57,410
features even compared to to the

00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,869
terminal of course because it's on the

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,149
web it can do hyperlinks both inside

00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:04,669
pages from one section to the other and

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,589
across pages pointing from one page to

00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:10,120
the other and there is additional

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:14,439
potential that is not yet really used

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:17,899
because the HTML elements have

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,419
annotations stating the syntactic

00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:22,789
functions so that could be used for CSS

00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:27,159
or for father markup right now the

00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:29,929
markup on the web is only the same as

00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:34,309
that terminal but one could add to that

00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:38,029
at this point I'd like to extend a

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:40,610
special thanks to Sebastian Marie French

00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:42,620
colleague who did an extensive security

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,289
audit of this code and reported to

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,659
considerable number of security bugs

00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:51,669
that meanwhile have all been fixed that

00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:56,620
that was that was quite useful to have

00:17:51,669 --> 00:18:02,779
yeah so we already had the coffee break

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:06,260
I was planning to yeah we're right on

00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:13,100
time planning to have a few minutes on

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:15,760
system integration and then the second

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,760
working phase

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:24,900
so I'll just beat this up what is first

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:31,140
what is system integration all about the

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:33,150
traditional way is to either format all

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,880
the manuals while you are building the

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,640
operation system and installing pre

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:43,860
formatted manuals some operating systems

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:47,700
do that or to install unformatted

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:51,540
manuals and then at runtime when we're

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,140
going to use a runs man the man in the

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,360
background

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,360
traditionally calls an Roth the

00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:04,220
formatter to format the manual page and

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,220
pipes the output to the user's pager now

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:12,690
quite some operation operating system

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:15,870
switch in this second way from an from

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,120
using and off to man dock which is

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,700
better because it's it's smaller it

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,300
doesn't use C++ in the base system it's

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,800
faster and many other things the

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,820
system's already having done that

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:32,430
include openbsd and netbsd freebsd is

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,170
about to do the switch so I prepared

00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,840
something for in case there would have

00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,120
been any freebies d developers here to

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:46,710
explain in depth what they still need to

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:49,590
do to get there I guess I will skip most

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,020
of it just a few points the first thing

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,110
they need to do is what some of you have

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,270
done here try and the tree of the

00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:00,840
weather everything really built with man

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:07,250
dog figure out the fatal issues report

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:10,890
the the non-fatal ones to us and so on

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,990
yeah that's about the non-fatal of

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,390
course if you're doing the system

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,610
integration it's more important than if

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,190
you are just doing quality checking to

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,440
see that the output form on doc is

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,390
really the same as the output from broth

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,610
because you don't want your manuals to

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,480
change you is just won't to exchange the

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,769
tool

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,619
and then finally you switch over the

00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:37,419
tree by exchanging the tool at that

00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,460
point it's important to do it right

00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,529
after a release when you have a long

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:47,049
time to fix

00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:49,090
potential problems yeah

00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:51,299
regression testing is not really

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:54,340
interesting here for this audience

00:20:51,299 --> 00:21:01,649
because it's about regression testing of

00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:05,590
the tool itself right so so much about

00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:12,340
about base system integration with very

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:14,559
brief manual pages in ports are you

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:19,720
aware of what ports is about what the

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:23,440
term means some but some are looking

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,929
confused it's it's if you take software

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,139
that is developed operating system

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:31,419
independently and make it run on a

00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:35,289
particular operating system that's yep

00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:37,659
so in that case you get very diverse

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:40,269
manual pages written by many different

00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:43,629
people in many different styles using

00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:47,470
all kinds of unusual functionalities so

00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:51,399
about 95% of them will work with with

00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:53,529
man-dog and about 5% will not work with

00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:55,929
undock because they are using low-level

00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:58,570
rough functionality that simply isn't

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:01,330
implemented yet or will maybe never be

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:05,649
implemented because a man who is not a

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:07,749
full Roth processor so you have to do

00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:10,899
something that those manuals that can't

00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:13,749
format with your new a base system - or

00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:16,419
Mardock still can be looked at by users

00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:19,119
you can't just broad rough and then you

00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:25,019
remember 5% of manual pages that are

00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:28,570
still gone simply gone the OpenBSD

00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:30,460
solution to that developed by Mark SP

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:36,580
who is also here and who is giving a

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:39,159
talk on on porting in general is to add

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,029
a flag to the to the port make file

00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:42,029
saying this

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:49,840
this port needs raw for formatting and

00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,630
if that flag is set in the port built

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,210
system preformed at the pages during the

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,330
build and install the formatted version

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,850
if that flag is absent just install and

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:04,570
format it once so that it gets possessed

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:08,470
at at runtime by the usual Mon dock in

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,710
the usual mandoke way that that works

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:16,420
quite well very reliably

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:18,430
and very simply in in OpenBSD we did it

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,980
in the way that first we marked all the

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,320
ports having manuals as used growth to

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,370
be on the safe side and then by hand

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:32,050
checked all of them and switched them

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:34,360
away from use growth we have about 8,000

00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,600
ports and thousand 200 of them still use

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,150
graphs so more than 3000 have been

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,190
checked in the last three years and have

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:50,230
been moved to to use man dock

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:53,230
yeah ok I'll skip that obviously we are

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,390
also improving man dock all the time

00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,980
fixing bugs implementing new

00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,380
functionality that helps helps

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,270
particular here is a list of some macros

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,790
and requests that have recently been

00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:06,700
implemented obviously that helps in

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:10,900
particular for ports because manuals and

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,820
ports are using lots of weird stuff oh I

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,190
didn't really talk about make what is

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:21,160
because that's also more for operating

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:23,800
system developers if you switch over if

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,870
you pull draw out of the tree completely

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,580
freebsd will probably never do that

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:32,110
because there are a lot of developers

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:34,780
who who think that having a real fully

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:38,500
professional typesetting system and bays

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,090
is important but net bsd might do that

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,040
at some point and you have to pay

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,780
attention to a few additional things but

00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,080
again as you are not changing the base

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:52,030
systems not go into the details here if

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,669
you're interested you can you can read

00:24:52,030 --> 00:25:01,769
that later

00:24:53,669 --> 00:25:07,149
okay so now we we have an opportunity

00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:10,240
for for working a bit more what would be

00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:13,330
especially interesting if in in this

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,370
second phase if you have a unique system

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:25,570
around where you can install the latest

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:31,029
version of of MDOC and L from CVS to do

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:37,870
that - to really test the the search

00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:41,490
tools and a few people say they expect

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:44,169
it in this area more of of a

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,899
introduction to to the philosophy of

00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:51,250
writing manuals in general and I talked

00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:55,870
to two kristaps he is willing to use

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:58,570
this the second working phase to give a

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:01,509
short presentation on that after asking

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:05,200
what exactly you you need is certainly

00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:07,750
competent to do that right away and then

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,500
I will will have helped those people who

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:15,009
want to try out the the very latest

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:17,799
search functionality - to get that going

00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:20,049
of course if you have started something

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,389
in the in the first working phase that

00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:25,120
you think is really interesting you can

00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:26,919
also continue that and try to get it to

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:32,919
a state where you can send me patches

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:35,440
that I can commit that yeah okay so I'd

00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,690
suggest that Kristoff's would get into

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,029
into this area and everybody who wants

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:44,919
to to join on more philosophical and

00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:52,000
groundbreaking stuff can join with them

00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:54,100
and people who want to to test search

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,320
functionality should probably show up

00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,610
that I helped them get started to get

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,610
the latest man-dog

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:11,260
if you haven't if you have a OpenBSD

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:15,160
current system you already have it so

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:20,190
who has an open BSD current system okay

00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,190
so you can do that easily that would be

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:29,620
the probably so that the number of stars

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,010
here is about the difficulty so that

00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:36,910
would probably 8 8 @ 4.1 or maybe a toad

00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:40,690
4.2 if you don't have that who is

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:47,140
interested to do that but does not have

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:51,130
an open BSD current system okay in that

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:53,170
case just take my notebook because on

00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,890
your phone it won't work and we don't

00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,890
need that right now

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,900
just get over I'll come back just get

00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,800
over here to to one of the terminals

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:15,070
yeah here this one for example use the

00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:18,250
shell and yep there you can okay so I

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:21,370
understand the remaining people are

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:25,390
continuing the work that was interrupted

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:29,220
by the coffee break right that's good

00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,220
yeah okay so and

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,549
yeah did have to it's a fresh install

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,980
this from this morning so I did have to

00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:56,730
make what is yeah yeah

00:28:46,980 --> 00:29:00,600
so at about the it's now 16 yeah

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:05,610
no it's now seven to seven minutes after

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:10,950
5:00 so at about 20 22 minutes after

00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:12,570
5:00 I'll start the wrap up giving you

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:24,750
an overview what the status and the

00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:29,179
various systems is and yeah okay so you

00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:29,179
are good good

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,210
okay you are joining two

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,470
yes of course just come back say at 22

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,860
or something like that then when you

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,860
come back

00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,650
[Music]

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:39,000
actions and then object is do some

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:39,000
examples or something a little bit yeah

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,090
you think that darkness

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:52,230
probably a larger project but yeah was

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:58,360
the thing that came to mind that had

00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:59,139
reasonably simple and not man dog man

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,169
page sir

00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:04,169
yeah it looks useful yeah okay

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,610
Oh

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:48,380
okay that right you are actually getting

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:51,740
mostly the same results because if a

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:55,970
manual page is system independent it

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:58,429
also shows up when you are asking for a

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:01,870
bit specific architecture because it is

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:01,870
a valid for that architecture

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,330
oh I already fix it

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,750
okay can you show one of the examples

00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:29,529
yeah

00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,299
yeah

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:07,010
know what you did this is actually right

00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:10,250
I only very briefly touched that if you

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:12,800
have trading punctuation with almost all

00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:17,139
macros you can just put it as an

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:23,090
additional argument at the end type of

00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:31,790
following please type man doc - capital

00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:38,990
T tree and now type - less first define

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:43,130
name of course but that - less like that

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:47,360
you see the you see the syntax tree

00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:52,340
expand it if you now go to the point

00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:54,919
where the also is then you see that the

00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:58,280
author name itself Steve Lavigne is in

00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:00,770
the element but it realizes that the dot

00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,010
is punctuation and puts it outside the

00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,450
element so that's a feature of them I'm

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,910
doctor at one of the advanced features

00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,450
of the end of language I only mentioned

00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,450
briefly

00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:44,650
that is completely correct yes yes so

00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:48,400
from the wait a minute

00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:51,450
from the perspective of punctuation that

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,450
looks perfect

00:35:51,930 --> 00:36:02,079
however the BR is a bit of tray a bit

00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:09,490
strange yes but and so please show how

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:14,710
that looks when you format it just man

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:18,180
doc filename and if you want you can

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,180
type it to less yes

00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:30,350
oh you have line breaks in there that

00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:35,120
may come as a surprise the reason for

00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:36,740
these line breaks is that da and macro

00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,710
can be used in the following way you

00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:43,180
just have an author section and then you

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:46,850
put multiple authors there each with a

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:51,650
with an A and macro but nothing else so

00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:54,560
you want a list of authors that's the

00:36:51,650 --> 00:37:03,260
default mode on the other hand you could

00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:05,290
also have a text where the other very

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:09,770
good yes thank you

00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:12,680
so here you have to put an A and - no

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:22,910
split in front such that you get rid of

00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:26,480
these ok so yes what looks like you will

00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:34,540
have some touches to send me to it yes

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:34,540
oh that looks strange

00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,930
what

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:56,960
oh there are two ways you can do that do

00:37:51,910 --> 00:38:09,230
the no way do you want to do what you

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:12,860
want to I you know there is that is the

00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:15,890
one thing where there is no option so

00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:20,540
you can get from the man command to all

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:23,990
other commands and you can get from from

00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:27,130
all commands to each other but you

00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:29,780
cannot get from another command to man

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,760
there is no option for that the reason

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,610
is that I didn't want to introduce any

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,040
new option options I only wanted to

00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:38,240
extend the existing options because I

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:45,860
don't want to introduce more

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:50,090
complication so there is no option for

00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:53,390
saying I just want to see one single

00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:58,220
manual once I introduced the - I option

00:38:53,390 --> 00:39:05,560
you can use that it may even work try

00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:05,560
man doc - I pseudo what it does

00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,879
[Music]

00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:30,950
it says no such file or directory no

00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:34,700
it's it's not yet implemented yeah so

00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:36,680
you found you found the one case were so

00:39:34,700 --> 00:40:01,910
if you want man you really need to type

00:39:36,680 --> 00:40:06,170
man yeah good observation yes first did

00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:11,180
it with cat but didn't we leave the what

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:17,180
I usually do is type something like the

00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:20,060
editor command then a semicolon then the

00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,520
formatter command with a pipe to less so

00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:27,890
what then happens is that as soon as I

00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:30,080
exit the editor good it's at one starts

00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:33,020
the formatter and less so I see the

00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,050
result when I type quit I'm back to

00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:39,080
shell again but then I can just recall

00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:44,860
the last command I can't run it again

00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:48,380
that is quite convenient when editing of

00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,670
course you can construct a while loop

00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,350
the shell while loop around it that was

00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:57,260
but then you probably need a sub shell

00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:59,650
but usually just do it the way I explain

00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,650
that yeah

00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:26,690
no Parker Brothers is the name of the

00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:30,910
games manufacturing company yes that's

00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,910
very brand is the author name

00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,450
you're finding stuff

00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:04,750
yeah

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:07,990
between what is and Apple what is has a

00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:11,230
much more restricted command-line syntax

00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:17,220
so if you you can only give words to

00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:17,220
what is well apropos can use the full

00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:25,200
expression syntax I present it and even

00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:28,060
if you give only words to upload for

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,120
then it's you it searches for these

00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:34,060
words as substrings so there might be

00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,790
trailing or leading characters well I

00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:41,770
mean what is looks for the word

00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:44,380
boundaries make sure that there are no

00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,840
prefixes or suffixes so usually you get

00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,780
the results from what is this a subset

00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,270
of the results from apropos

00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:58,380
which is not really new that's how it

00:42:52,270 --> 00:43:02,340
works for decades yeah that will give a

00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,340
lot of results yes

00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:13,710
it's basically everything that contains

00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,710
the word pearl in the title line

00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:36,800
yeah you actually know it matters you

00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:40,490
actually have to leave it on the author

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,450
name line because if you put it on the

00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:55,160
next line there would be a blank in the

00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:58,750
formatted output because no the the

00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,820
internal mechanism to recognize it as

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:06,080
trailing punctuation only works if it's

00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:09,290
if it's on the same line so if you end

00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,450
the line then it's like the here we are

00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:16,160
finished so you have a try trailing

00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:20,050
blank and then the comma is something

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,050
like the start of the next sentence

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:48,819
yeah that was Oh what I usually do at

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:51,369
that point yeah that works there is a

00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:59,650
trick to get to get a similar string

00:44:51,369 --> 00:45:08,740
quicker if you just say CVS up my blank

00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:11,500
- D P small D capital P the the yes like

00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:14,170
that the options are not strictly

00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:17,050
required but it's a good habit to use

00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:21,690
these options because it will give you

00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:25,060
new parts and directories if you do that

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:29,020
it will report which files are modified

00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:38,700
at the same time check whether anything

00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:41,589
has has been updated upstream that's a

00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,640
very convenient way to find your own

00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:44,640
changes in the tree

00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:09,700
yeah switching to a different different

00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,240
source code management system is a bit

00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,660
tricky

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:17,680
yesterday attended to tutorial on SVN

00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:19,809
and had the same experience everything

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:42,160
is different I'm used to both CBS and

00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:52,510
git but yeah I think it's gotten to a

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:55,300
contraction yeah well I said maybe but

00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:57,280
if you if you have found it and even

00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,559
fixed it then just include the patch and

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,040
I'll see whether I can get it in with it

00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:04,510
for example if there are multiple

00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,309
patches in the same tree and they can be

00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:09,150
committed together then it's not spam

00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:09,150
either so

00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:25,500
no I think in this case so if you would

00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:27,930
already be a new developer who were

00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,450
going to commit it himself then the

00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:33,150
usual advice would be to make sure that

00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:37,380
every patch is small and self-contained

00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:40,250
and only does one well-defined thing on

00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,180
the other hand these changes are

00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:46,740
relatively simple and straightforward

00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:50,160
and all of similar nature so it's

00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,170
basically one thing you are doing and in

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,619
particular since you're not going to

00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:59,339
commit it yourself it's much less work

00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:02,339
to just send a single patch and then if

00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:04,829
if it needs to be split up it's even

00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:07,230
less work for me to split it up myself

00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:15,950
if it needs to be split up so just send

00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:15,950
me one patch okay good

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:55,669
okay get back in a minute where these

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:55,669
Christoph's get to yes do you know okay

00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:11,210
oh you're coming back for the wrap-up

00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:11,210
good

00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,660
okay

00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:32,940
yeah okay so I'm sorry that I might have

00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:36,240
to rethink my hope okay

00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:39,620
but it seems like it it helped a bit -

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,620
yeah okay

00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:05,830
oh where is the mouse

00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,600
what

00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:52,000
okay sorry I come i confused I confused

00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:58,810
my notebook by by plugging in and out

00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:01,900
stuff and it so you have two or three

00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:04,260
additional minutes before I can do the

00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,260
wrap-up

00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:26,719
okay so the small side session work for

00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,719
you

00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:50,950
yeah that's a development notebook so I

00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,440
have separate partitions for four

00:52:50,950 --> 00:53:06,210
different parts of the source trees and

00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:14,550
the object areas and so on sorry yeah

00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:14,550
sure okay so back in working order

00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:36,250
MOBA 1409 talk PDF

00:53:47,890 --> 00:54:01,509
and I guess I have to move this thing

00:53:52,180 --> 00:54:09,630
away yeah back in working order page 50

00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:12,400
or something okay for the wrap-up I'm

00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:17,589
briefly going through the various

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:20,410
operation systems that this conference

00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:23,109
applies to and telling you what the

00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:28,119
status in respect with respect to

00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:31,299
manuals is in OpenBSD we were the first

00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:34,170
operating system completely switching to

00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:38,170
man dock and it's now almost four years

00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:41,470
that hope that graph is completely

00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:43,869
disconnected from the build and the man

00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:46,210
dock is the only documentation for

00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:51,670
matter in the OpenBSD based system so

00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:56,640
since october 2010 and since april this

00:54:51,670 --> 00:55:00,749
year we are having the full make what is

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,749
yeah that's a good idea thank you

00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:06,749
since april this year we are having the

00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:11,559
forum equities apropos functionality

00:55:06,749 --> 00:55:17,529
that some of you have been experimenting

00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:19,390
with so that's nearly a finished story

00:55:17,529 --> 00:55:22,029
of course there are a few things still

00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:24,819
to do I will come to that later in the

00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:27,759
very last slide future things to do

00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:32,109
future things are likely to again happen

00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:36,690
in OpenBSD first the second system to

00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:41,289
switch to using man-dog as the default

00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:43,809
vomiter with net bsd net bsd also had

00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:48,430
man dock in base very early already in

00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:50,470
2009 york's Onondaga did that is in the

00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:53,470
room right beside and the net bsd

00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:56,549
developed a summit yes he's here

00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:56,549
just saw him

00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:07,380
and Jackson burger and tumors Klausner

00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:11,130
also support man dog in in pkg source a

00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:13,230
portable supporting system with supports

00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:17,400
lots and lots of different platforms so

00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:20,940
that's quite important the the point in

00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:25,020
time when they switch was basically 2012

00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:28,620
and one big step the next thing net be

00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:32,070
is do you should probably do is figure

00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:34,410
out how to get semantic searching but

00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:36,360
that's a rather big problem because

00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:39,480
right now they have full-text search

00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:43,170
that is not semantic but also using

00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:45,870
SQLite so they have to figure out how to

00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:48,260
to integrate the two searching systems

00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:50,580
the one the homegrown one they did and

00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:55,200
the semantic searching that will be

00:56:50,580 --> 00:57:00,330
tricky you can be glad that you need not

00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:02,970
do it now FreeBSD and dragonfly both

00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:09,080
have man doc in the base system FreeBSD

00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:12,480
since version 10 but in both FreeBSD and

00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,960
dragonfly it's only installed and not

00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,030
yet used by default semantic searching

00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:22,470
is not yet supported at all not even as

00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:25,320
an option the next steps then would be

00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:28,290
to update to the latest release one

00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:32,670
thirteen one and then to actually use it

00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:35,700
to format manuals and unless they manage

00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:39,350
to do that it's not much use talking

00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,350
about anything else for those systems

00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:46,430
foolish berlin in freebsd has done a lot

00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:49,350
of preparatory work franco Fichtner in

00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:58,110
dragonfly also so they should manage to

00:57:49,350 --> 00:58:01,020
do it now there is one more system that

00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:03,780
recently switched to using man-dog any

00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:08,350
of you have any guests where that could

00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:11,530
be no

00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:20,380
it runs on Apple Kristoff's has always

00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:24,310
tested it yes oh I gave it away right

00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:27,160
forgot about it sorry that's that's an

00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:31,750
amazing thing that happened there years

00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:35,470
ago in 2010 or 2011 two guys from

00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:39,280
illumos briefly spoke to me and then

00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:43,290
ever again and I thought well they are

00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:47,860
not doing anything and then this July

00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:51,910
just a few months ago suddenly one giant

00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:52,510
commit happened and they did all in one

00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,210
step

00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:57,850
they imported mandoke into base they

00:58:55,210 --> 00:59:00,190
switched from installing formatted

00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:02,170
manuals to informit manuals and they

00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:05,460
switch from using Groth as a formative

00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:09,600
to using man-dog as a formative

00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:12,970
all-in-one commit and it just worked I

00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:15,360
have no idea how to manage to get they

00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:18,660
managed to get such a giant switch

00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:21,970
working at once but there weren't even

00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,920
many cleanup commits afterwards must

00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:26,800
have done a tremendous amount of testing

00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:30,070
so right now illumise is the only non

00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:36,300
BSD that is using man-dog by default

00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:38,680
mimics by the way the MINIX chief like a

00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:44,140
Tannenbaum is here and is giving a talk

00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:46,270
MINIX has OpenBSD true and has a man

00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:48,400
docking bays because they have imported

00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:51,100
it from nephews dear have most of the

00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,590
net bsd userland but they are not using

00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:57,760
it and it is very old it's three years

00:59:53,590 --> 01:00:01,990
old and never updated it Mac OS X has an

00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:04,290
old port an old package from 2010 but it

01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,290
seems

01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:23,740
Mack toured cities yeah oh they have oh

01:00:13,029 --> 01:00:26,589
I didn't even know that okay so if any

01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:29,200
anybody is using actually using Mac OS

01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:32,349
and finds a port just tell me I'm always

01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:35,589
interested keep includes using it to be

01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:39,660
to be able to actually help people well

01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:43,210
but so it definitely runs on Mac OS and

01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:47,009
but not very actively maintained

01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:47,009
recently I noticed yes Oh

01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:12,460
one dot one dot three no well that's

01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:15,130
that's worse than prehistoric I mean

01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:17,739
everything that is older than 1.11 is

01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:23,940
really really aged like three or four

01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:27,670
years old okay we can figure out that

01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:29,680
afterwards yeah yeah manifesting and I

01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:33,910
recently realized that there is even a

01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:36,309
cycling port for for Windows I I never

01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:39,369
talked to the guy Yakko circle bits but

01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:42,130
I dropped him a mail but didn't receive

01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:43,989
an answer yet so even for Windows users

01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:45,999
there might be a way to get that but I'm

01:01:43,989 --> 01:01:51,009
I don't really know much about Windows

01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:55,989
so I can't help much there yeah status

01:01:51,009 --> 01:01:58,630
in Linux there's one Linux distribution

01:01:55,989 --> 01:02:00,849
that is very actively maintaining their

01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:04,239
port also has it for a long time which

01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:08,200
is elton linux alpine linux the small

01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:11,319
french distribution focusing on keeping

01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:14,529
it it's small and simple also for for

01:02:11,319 --> 01:02:18,519
embedded stuff they have provided a lot

01:02:14,529 --> 01:02:20,710
of feedback then of course arch linux

01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:25,630
and slack well you know expose

01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:29,109
portes and recently this April a guy

01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:31,660
popped up who has basically prepared

01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:33,420
ports for everything center as debian

01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:37,599
fedora read heads

01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:39,609
Suzu Ubuntu but of course it takes a

01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,800
long time to get anything into those

01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:44,200
systems so we should probably speak

01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:48,210
again in two or three years whether

01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,210
anything has actually been imported yes

01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:11,530
okay okay I never heard about that

01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,830
distribution but I will we'll have a

01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,540
look

01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:15,849
Oh actually that's not a good idea to

01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:21,970
replace growth because the main purpose

01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:24,760
of growth is a a typesetting system so

01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:26,770
you use it for setting books or talks or

01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:30,369
something while man-dog is a

01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:33,220
documentation system so you it may well

01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:51,040
be that you need both at the same time

01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:53,050
but yeah no it's good good that you sure

01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,420
just mentioned that you shouldn't do it

01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:58,330
that it that way because it might

01:03:55,420 --> 01:04:04,150
mislead people if it sounds like that

01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:06,010
okay so possibly future directions there

01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:07,480
are still quite a few of things I'd like

01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:09,990
I'd like to do

01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:13,869
of course replace the traditional man

01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:16,810
implementation in open BSD was the man

01:04:13,869 --> 01:04:19,359
doc one which is more powerful switch

01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:22,510
the default output mode from t ascii to

01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:24,730
t loco that's actually a very easy thing

01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:28,180
to do it will not affect people who are

01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:30,010
using the c local because we're just do

01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:32,950
the same as before but it will be more

01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:34,540
convenient for people using a new utf-8

01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:37,090
local

01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,100
then I'd like to integrate pre-con into

01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:42,160
man-dog that will especially be

01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:48,160
interesting for Russian and Japanese

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:52,060
people who are using utf-8 manuals in

01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:53,920
non-english languages will make the

01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:58,150
command line for running the formative

01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:01,420
much easier and there is a lot of work

01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:04,750
going on on conversion tools like the

01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:07,510
the libra ssl documentation is right now

01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:09,610
all in the Perl documentation format

01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:12,070
part and we are converting it to em doc

01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:14,920
and Kristoff's and myself are working on

01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:18,690
to two tools to faciliate that that's of

01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:23,440
course related to man doc some other

01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:26,590
projects of a similar way like providing

01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,020
tools to some of you have started to do

01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:32,320
manual translations from man to man doc

01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:37,140
from man to MDOC there is also a project

01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:41,820
to to use an existing tool by Eric Steve

01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:45,460
Raymond to couple that with with man doc

01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:47,380
to to get manuals translated from man to

01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:49,660
man doc see me automatically you will

01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:54,490
still have to to do manual

01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:57,190
post-processing of course and I I'd also

01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:59,440
like to do some low-level infrastructure

01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:05,010
work on mono that I'll not bore you with

01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:09,430
so there is still interesting future and

01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:11,350
finally I'd like to mention a few people

01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:14,200
who help with this of course

01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:16,420
kristaps Johnson's who wrote the tool in

01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:20,470
the first place a few years ago then

01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:23,320
York's Onondaga from Mac PSD who helped

01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:26,500
write important code in particular in

01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:30,310
the initial phase few years ago there

01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:33,070
have been considerable a considerable

01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:36,280
number of people from various projects

01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:40,450
who contributed patches Franco Christo's

01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:43,330
- good him - who told me very important

01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:46,240
is the work that Mark SP and OpenBSD has

01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:48,390
done on thoughts integration I think I

01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,690
wouldn't have been able to go any

01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:52,799
with lots and lots of discussions with

01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:58,140
the OpenBSD

01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:59,700
manual maintain adjacent mcintyre the

01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:03,200
whole thing probably wouldn't have

01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:05,430
happened either without Theo de Raadt

01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,619
OpenBSD product late who invited

01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:09,150
crystals to commit the stuff otherwise I

01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:12,299
probably have missed the whole thing

01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:16,230
completely then thanks again to

01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:20,490
Sebastian AVI for the recent security

01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:22,890
check on the on the web thingy the main

01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:26,369
people who help porting are Chalmers

01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:30,359
Klausner net bsd is who is always also

01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:32,130
in the room beside who did net bsd

01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:35,400
porting and village of course and

01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:38,970
FreeBSD there were a lot more people in

01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:42,869
open BSD which I'm not all named who did

01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:45,059
various things to help us and a very

01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:49,309
long it's actually an impressive list

01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:52,079
all these people reported bugs or

01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:55,109
suggestions that were actually acted on

01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:59,420
so each of these names resulted in at

01:07:55,109 --> 01:08:06,960
least one commit yeah and then I used

01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:11,970
lots of pictures but so do you have any

01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,829
questions to finish the session anything

01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:16,460
else you should like to know about

01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:16,460
manuals

01:08:22,120 --> 01:09:11,850
yeah even after looking at the man okay

01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:55,140
okay so that's that's that's probably

01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:55,140
Kristoff's tutorial yes

01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,740
not for really using it after you have

01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,630
collected a bit of experience but

01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:31,150
forgetting started that would be an

01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:33,240
interesting thing yeah so that

01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:36,820
interestingly there is also something

01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:39,010
I'm taking back from here because my

01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:41,800
impression is that there are quite a few

01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:45,460
experienced people around here who do a

01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:48,460
lot of software development and that in

01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:54,840
in contrast to what I what I think the

01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:59,550
stuff is a bit less easy to approach

01:10:54,840 --> 01:11:02,470
then then I thought and that maybe I

01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:08,710
even started an on a level that was a

01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:11,950
bit a bit advanced so so my impression

01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:15,280
is that there is really a need for for

01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:18,820
basic documentation basic tutorials and

01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:22,450
tools to get started yeah so we we

01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:25,560
should definitely clean up and improve

01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:29,440
your tutorials and what is already there

01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:31,420
is a recommendation it besides the if

01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,520
you if you want to read a bit more of it

01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:35,260
when you get home then of course you

01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,140
have the slides to look at again you

01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:40,240
have to the writer which has a bit a lot

01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:43,330
more of technical detail you have the

01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:46,240
tutorial but there are lots of stuff for

01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:50,700
us to to improve in particular for

01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:53,440
beginners that's interesting for me yeah

01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:56,500
anything you want to say for the for the

01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,090
wrap up mate maybe what anything you

01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:05,820
missed or anything you enjoy

01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:05,820
particularly okay

01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:24,970
nice Tina nice to hear that okay yeah

01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:28,180
then I wish all the few a nice evening

01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:35,080
and two nice conference really starting

01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:35,710
tomorrow that whole thing enjoy thank

01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:40,899
