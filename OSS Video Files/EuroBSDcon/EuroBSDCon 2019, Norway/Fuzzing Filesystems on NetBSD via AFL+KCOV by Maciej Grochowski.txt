	Fuzzing Filesystems on NetBSD via AFL+KCOV

Filesystems are one of the most important parts of OS. Because they are responsible for storing user data, any software bug can potentially cause damage and data corruption. So from OS users perspective, data needs to be safe and bulletproof. Any data corruption may imminently cause users to switch to other software stacks. Because of that part of the NetBSD, the community decided to spend more effort on hardening FSes. For the last few years, NetBSD became strong with new security features in the BSD world as Sanitizers or Fuzzers. Now this work is being used to finding and fixing different FS bugs.
