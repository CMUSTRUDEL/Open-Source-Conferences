Description: 
	Patricia is a programmer who has worked mostly in C++ and Java. She has spent her career continuously delivering from the same code-base to a large user base, from working on two browsers (Opera and Vivaldi), to working on embedded telepresence endpoints for Cisco. She is focused on the maintainability and flexibility of software architecture, and how to extend it to provide cutting edge user experiences.

Her focus on the end users has led her work more and more toward privacy and security, and she has recently started her own company, TurtleSec, hoping to contribute positively to the infosec and C++ communities. She is also involved in the #includeC++ organization hoping to improve diversity and inclusion in the C++ community

it's very good to see you today I'm very

00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:13,940
honored to be invited to spend the day

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,430
with you and we're going to start off I

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,660
guess a little bit more on the on the

00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:24,980
thinking side of things because the talk

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:28,910
I pitched and got accepted is about

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:34,150
ethics in tech but first a little bit

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:37,220
about me so my name is Patricia oils I

00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,180
am a C++ programmer which I guess means

00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:44,360
I'm in the wrong room

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:48,260
I am currently teaching C at at at a

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:51,340
college and also but it's C on Linux so

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,340
I'm still in the wrong room

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
I'm currently specializing in

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,860
application security or where

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,570
programming needs security and that

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,710
means anything from secure programming

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,630
in C++ to more security culture and I do

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,050
that in my own company called turtle

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,360
sack but previously I've worked many

00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:15,320
different places my first like real job

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,560
was at opera and I I started in 2005

00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,150
working as the first a full-time

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,780
employee working on the Unix Linux

00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:31,070
desktop browser so who used opera back

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:35,540
in the day yay awesome and who used

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:43,310
Opera on FreeBSD awesome and who

00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:47,770
actually ever had like plugins work ok

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,770
that one guy ok I did that

00:01:50,790 --> 00:02:00,750
I have to be honest it was never like a

00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,050
priority of the Opera CEOs that that

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,730
that opera should work on FreeBSD that

00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,310
was never actually a part of anybody's

00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,840
plan or anybody if we actually did agile

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,790
back there this would be totally off

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,540
books because it was never on anybody's

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,650
plan but I had this really awesome guy

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,830
who was volunteer

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,570
I was called Ariane for Llewyn and he he

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,390
decided to take it upon himself to do

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,130
the freebsd port of opera where he did

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,670
the the packaging and everything and so

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,850
and then later on we hired him and he

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,380
became one of my close colleagues and we

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,930
ended up being like a small team of

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:41,160
people working on Unix Linux

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,930
EE things so so FreeBSD opera was

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,870
definitely a labor of love and so I'm

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:50,250
glad people used in we did weirder

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:55,709
things like we did we did a version of

00:02:50,250 --> 00:03:00,570
opera which was for Debian on spark it

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:04,350
had one user we never told we never told

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:10,019
management about that one either we had

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:16,140
another one we had Solaris on x86 also

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:19,530
one user probably maybe the same guy but

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,150
anyway yes moving on so yes so I've been

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:28,580
doing this for a while been programming

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:29,910
now for for 20 years but I have I have a

00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:36,360
hobby

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:38,489
I read election documents and then I

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,300
petition for more election documents and

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:44,100
then I imagine how I can hack elections

00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,730
specifically no region elections is is

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,280
my hobby and it's it's a weird hobby

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,620
I've been doing it now for a while it's

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,750
it was an accident I did my thesis my

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,730
master's thesis was making a prototype

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,920
of the Norwegian election system so I

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,859
had to read although all of the laws and

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,650
everything to figure out how elections

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:10,110
actually are done in our way

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:16,799
so yeah other people knit or you know do

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:18,510
photography and I I do this so people

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,130
ask me are you why are you so cynical

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,229
why are you always like talking about

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,660
people are evil and people are gonna are

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,419
you paranoid and that's like the thing

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,419
is I'm not cynical at all I'm like

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:32,400
ridiculously idealistic I wouldn't do

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,710
this if I wasn't really idealistic I

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,540
believe in democracy I believe and then

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,560
the democratic process and I believe

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:44,460
that my work or my hobby helps that

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:48,060
process and and it takes a lot of time

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,550
it takes a lot of time unpaid time that

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,199
I do to do this and and a lot of things

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:57,900
that I hate doing like talking to

00:04:52,199 --> 00:05:00,660
strangers so but if we've gotten there

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:05,580
have been strides in the time well while

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:09,000
I've been doing this but the problem is

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,250
what the reason why I'm doing this is I

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,310
believe that election processes all over

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:18,419
the world not only in Norway have become

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,880
more fragile and even broken through the

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,349
introduction of computers and that's

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
really weird coming from me it was like

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:26,639
a professional program and all I do is

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,260
computers and I have a whole talk on why

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,030
this is the case and if you want to see

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,240
it and understand why Patricia says

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,639
these crazy things and then then my go

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,520
to my Twitter and my pin tweet there's

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:42,270
like a whole whole talk on that so I'm

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,280
not going to talk about that today but

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,440
I'm going to talk a little bit about how

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,889
I do this work and what I've learned

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,479
during this work and a little and that's

00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,530
going to map into some of the things

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,150
that I hope we can change as an industry

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,010
because you'd think that I do this by

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,960
writing good petitions and having

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,699
meetings and being serious and having

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,169
people take me seriously and all of

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,650
those things and that's absolutely not

00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:07,289
true

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,750
and nobody has actually taken me

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,180
seriously or all right well that's not

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:16,440
really true that the Minister of Justice

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,180
in 2017 and I have to be precise because

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,750
we've had a bunch of Minister of

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,509
justice here in norway since then but at

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,530
the time he said to reuters that i was

00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:32,610
basically a threat to national security

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:34,740
so so so no not really popular and the

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,210
ministry in charge of this and the

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,310
directorate in charge of this i think

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,680
they probably have like played darts

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,770
with my picture

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,630
because the thing is i wasn't i i i have

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,870
achieved what i've achieved not by being

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:53,330
taken seriously i have achieved what

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,330
i've achieved by being really annoying

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:12,599
so i consider myself to be annoying as a

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:15,240
service so today we are going to talk

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,370
about embedded ethics and embedded here

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,770
is both embedded in our culture embedded

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:24,500
in in the products that we make and

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:27,000
embedded in us what does this mean being

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,270
being responsible for the things that we

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,979
make and i and i think we sometimes need

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:39,180
to think a little bit about the world

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:41,430
that we made because we made a digital

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,830
world and we didn't design it that way

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,949
it kind of just ended up that way we

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,860
made a world that is totally digitized

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,199
from you from birth until death people

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,479
can't actually do anything like you

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,820
can't live your life and be off-grid

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,460
some services are only available online

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,099
even public services are only available

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,250
online and and we put all sorts of

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:07,650
things online like we put our power

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,550
services online our water services

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,740
online like we have put dams online we

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,789
have a search engine dedicated to just

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:20,370
finding things installations that are

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:23,849
online and there are the weirdest things

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,680
that are online and and we made this

00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:28,789
digital world a little bit like a

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,380
piecemeal over time it's a legacy system

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:32,050
so we made digital world and then we

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,990
made

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:38,950
buddy live in it not just us we made

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:43,269
everybody live in it and the problem is

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:46,209
they never had a choice we built in the

00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:53,260
digital world around everyone in the

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:56,920
world and we have totally failed

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,959
to make them literate in this world we

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,720
made a world they don't even understand

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,940
we made a world that they they don't

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,410
understand how it works and basically

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,050
they're what we taught them that is

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,880
magic made a magic world for you where

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,339
you press magic buttons the magic things

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,089
happen and the people most people don't

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:17,440
even understand how a web page is

00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:19,089
rendered on their device they don't

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,620
understand what that is they don't

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,940
understand they was like yeah I have

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,410
internet on my thing in 2005 it was

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,140
really really hard to explain to people

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,910
what I was doing for a living and people

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,260
were like yes what do you do now I work

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,660
at opera and they were like oh so you

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:40,000
work at the opera no no no I I work at

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,820
opera we make we make a browser and

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,089
people are like what is a browser and I

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:50,230
was like um so you know that little e

00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:54,250
yeah you know and they were like oh you

00:09:50,230 --> 00:10:02,649
have the Internet yeah yeah I make that

00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:05,110
just an old and that was 2005 okay we've

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,899
gotten further than that now but this is

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:13,510
not long ago and we are this is this is

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:16,149
the world we've created right and when

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,970
we fail them and we have failed them so

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,940
many times by creating things that are

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,949
harmful for them right and when we fail

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,680
them they don't even understand how we

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:29,470
failed them we can't even explain to

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,930
them how we failed them if you try to

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,730
ask a regular normal person what the

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,269
whole Snowden thing was about they have

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,190
no idea if you ask them about the

00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,829
Cambridge analytical thing they don't

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,720
understand that either we managed to

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:47,040
fail them in ways that regular people

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,040
don't even understand

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,350
most journalists I talked to about

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,149
election security and I talked to a lot

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,829
of journalists you wouldn't think so

00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,779
because there's hardly anything written

00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:02,829
and the reason for that is that most of

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:03,999
them never write anything because they

00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:08,470
don't understand what I'm saying

00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:11,889
I spend literally hours and hours

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,290
explaining computers elections security

00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,329
all of these things to to to journalists

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,459
and it and they find it very difficult

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:20,980
and when you think about it this is like

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:24,790
the simplest thing ever we have paper

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,329
ballots in Norway okay so we have

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,509
physical paper this this should be very

00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,300
understandable

00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,730
we have document scanners connected to

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,529
Windows machines that have software

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,939
downloaded from the internet of course

00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,180
these machines are connected to the

00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:43,360
Internet and and and this is how we

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,999
count the ballots using computers this

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,189
should be of all of the things that are

00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:51,699
complicated that we do this is quite

00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:54,490
simple and they don't understand what

00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:56,170
I'm saying and if they understand what

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,819
I'm saying after a lot of explaining

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,370
they don't understand the implications

00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:01,629
if I find something that is wrong and

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,819
they'll go like yeah yeah yeah but I

00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:06,629
talked to them and it was a mistake I'm

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:09,339
like yeah I understand it's a mistake

00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:10,870
most of the things that we do when it

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,509
doesn't do what we wanted to do it's a

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,860
mistake we didn't mean it to but they

00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,480
generally don't understand the

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,800
implications for democracy they don't

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,589
understand the implications for the

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,350
voting process and if I manage to get

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:28,269
them that far they don't understand how

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:30,610
to explain it to anybody because I spent

00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:33,069
just spent a few hours trying to explain

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:36,009
it to a journalist how are they going to

00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:41,709
explain it in a short article to normal

00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:43,839
normal people we made a digital world

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:46,540
and we are struggling to protect it we

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:52,829
are putting our users are the general

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,829
population our families at risk and

00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:57,790
those that make the decisions that we

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,060
need to make decisions politicians

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,870
people with power

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:05,150
they don't understand it either I talked

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,330
to people who have power political power

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,490
have a social power and they don't

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,190
understand what I'm talking about I'm

00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:15,110
trying to get people to change the laws

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,060
and regulations in Norway and I'm

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,760
talking to people that don't understand

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:23,020
what I'm saying and I didn't think it

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,820
was that bad until I had to do it

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,470
we sold a story to the general

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,450
population that all of these magical

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,430
devices they carry around are benign

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,950
little monsters that they that they can

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,990
do their bidding they don't understand

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,670
that they that these things are built by

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,120
people who are powerful that have

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:44,210
motivations that want something that the

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,020
technology isn't neutral and now we

00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:50,870
can't explain how we failed because we

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,150
sold this story and they believe it

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,010
when I try to talk to people about the

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,140
problems that we're having with security

00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,440
and privacy in these things people think

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,240
I'm paranoid because that is how these

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,830
people have been portrayed like if you

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,860
go back and you look at movies in the

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,410
early 2000s about people saying Snowden

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,410
like things in movies

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,870
they're always crazy they're always like

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,390
the hair all over the place drawing on

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,150
the wall type crazy right in movies and

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,920
then suddenly yeah and suddenly there we

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,720
are it's like okay so how are you going

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,020
to say this to people okay so you know

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,310
all of the movies about like how

00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,320
terrible like surveillance mass

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,350
surveillance was and all of the crazy

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,770
people everything they said okay it was

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,770
worse

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,129
we can't explain how we sold their

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,699
privacy we can explain

00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:53,120
because it is mind-boggling how attract

00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:54,680
regular people are how how their

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,120
personal information that they thought

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,970
they were sharing with their families or

00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,610
their close friends has been sold many

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,569
times over to private companies

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,180
specifically to target them as

00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:08,959
individuals we can't explain it they

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:11,509
don't understand it we can't explain how

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,509
we broke democracy by creating platforms

00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:17,899
for mass influence for propaganda

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:19,899
machines we can't explain it because

00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:28,009
they don't understand it they think

00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:30,920
Facebook is private we can explain how

00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:33,290
we embed devices in their bodies that we

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,779
don't even fully understand and that we

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,610
are not fully protecting you can't

00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,560
explain to a person that yes I have to

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,959
embed this pacemaker in your body but

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,130
the thing is it has a Bluetooth

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:49,550
vulnerability but you know without it

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:55,699
you're gonna die anyway so you know what

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:58,459
you're gonna do we can explain how our

00:15:55,699 --> 00:16:00,230
white male dominated industry keeps on

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:03,350
creating things that are unsuited for

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,470
people of color or women we have been

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,630
doing this for four decades and it's

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,410
only now occurring to us that this is

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:14,329
actually a problem because surprise the

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:19,220
majority of the population of the world

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:22,610
is not my white males we have like a

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,550
good chunk 50% who are not male at all

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,939
and a really large portion of this world

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:31,130
is not white so we need to start

00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:33,050
thinking about how we can make things

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,449
for everyone because we are actually

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:39,079
making things for the entire world

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:41,149
people who are not like us at all you

00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:43,430
have people in that have high speed

00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:47,480
internet making things for people who

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:49,850
have hardly any internet at all you have

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,800
websites that that are made in Silicon

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,880
Valley that that don't even load in

00:16:51,800 --> 00:17:00,170
large parts of the

00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:02,720
because they're massive we can explain

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:06,410
things though we can explain our

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,020
problems of our our industry and we and

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,870
we need to explain because we need their

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,459
help but we can't explain because they

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,030
don't understand what we're saying

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,660
and that's such a problem and I feel

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,819
that's so much like how can I actually

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,309
how can i push my little agenda which is

00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,750
election security forward when I'm

00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,500
talking to people that don't understand

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:32,150
what I'm saying and that's so important

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,700
they don't understand what I what we're

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,210
saying and they don't even believe it

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,789
when we tell them like when I say how

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,650
Norwegian elections are run and and the

00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:50,510
problems the security people think I'm

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:52,280
crazy and so I'm going to talk a little

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:55,730
bit because I've had some conversations

00:17:52,280 --> 00:18:01,720
and this is my mental model of of Essex

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:04,250
in all of us so you have innate

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,929
something you just can't help it's

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,970
something that you do automatically you

00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,990
don't even think about it these are the

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,940
things that you will see in your

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:14,150
workplace culture things that you just

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,980
don't do and these are the things that

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,309
you nobody taught you it wasn't written

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:24,549
anywhere it was just how how we do

00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:26,960
things around here or that we don't do

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:28,669
like back in the day when I worked at

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,510
opera one of those things that I didn't

00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:35,600
even realize until I left was we don't

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,059
compromise on our users privacy that was

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,039
a thing we never said it it wasn't on a

00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,990
poster on the wall it wasn't something

00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:42,500
that somebody told me when I started at

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,679
the company

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,530
it was just a thing we like if somebody

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,240
proposed a solution and and we saw a

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,909
privacy implication that somebody said

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,220
yeah but that would expose some privacy

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:58,549
thing for the user and then we go like

00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,640
yeah sure okay we can't do that it was

00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:02,780
just we don't do that around here those

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,490
are the things you don't even argue

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,350
about you don't even think about you

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,970
just do

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,669
and those are highly influenced by your

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,520
also your national culture and that's a

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:16,070
weird thing if you come from Norway we

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,500
have a very non hierarchical Society a

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,990
meaning and that translates a lot to our

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,049
businesses we have a very flat structure

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,260
but we also have very strong strong

00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:29,890
historical unions in Norway which have

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,390
introduced a lot of workplace

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:36,230
legislation it's really really really

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:38,179
hard to fire somebody in our way it's

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,600
ridiculously difficult to fire somebody

00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,159
in Norway but Don the combined flat

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,289
structure and the fact that you know

00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,840
it's really hard to fire you means that

00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:49,580
in Norway people will actually speak up

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,929
and they'll say I think this is wrong I

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,320
think this is stupid they will actually

00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:56,030
be able to say that to their superiors

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,559
and this is something that Norwegians

00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,780
take for granted we don't even think

00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:02,570
about it that that we have that freedom

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,309
at work but then when I was at Cisco and

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,039
I'm suddenly meeting a lot of people

00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:09,500
working in the States who have have

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:14,870
contracts where they can be fired for no

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,490
reason the next day then you're starting

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,200
to think I'm not going to bring up

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,929
anything that's going to rock this boat

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,780
I have a mortgage I have kids I have I

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:26,419
got things I am NOT going to take the

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:29,299
risk of losing my job to tell my boss

00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:30,950
that this thing is stupid then you know

00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:34,909
then they'll have to deal with that

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:37,370
later and then you have the more

00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:39,679
conscious ethical decisions right and

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:42,080
I've been I've been talking to people in

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,600
the medical medical field and they will

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,909
have like well it's life or death you

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,650
know so I will do this because a life is

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:51,020
at stake or they will do you know they

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:54,380
have these big moral dilemmas and and

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:57,020
those are great because it's very clear

00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,929
it's delineated you can make conscious

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,720
decisions you feel very like powerful in

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:04,880
the moment but the problem is all of the

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,169
stuff in between right because here you

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,309
have the right versus wrong but then you

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:12,110
have like all of the grey it's like what

00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:14,510
do we do there and what you also see is

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,640
that it kind of overlaps with the innate

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:20,330
and the conscious thing is all of these

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,549
socially things which are very

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,440
difficult to define but there are some

00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:28,220
really interesting research into this

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,309
area and specifically I want to talk

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,490
about two they are related and the first

00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:37,340
one is the principle of social proof

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,990
this is the tendency that people have to

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,230
when they're not really sure how to

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,210
react to something they look and around

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,240
and see how other people are reacting

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,309
and then they think that reaction that

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,250
the other people are having is the right

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:55,340
reaction to have and this is very

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,980
interesting because that means that that

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,070
as a social group we have a tendency to

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,440
react as a group which means that if you

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,440
are in a room where everybody else seems

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,429
to think something is OK and you don't

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,350
feel it's ok then you think

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,850
automatically that ok but they be all of

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,519
these people who I respect and I think

00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:20,120
are decent human beings think this is ok

00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:22,940
so it probably is ok and I'm just

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,480
misunderstanding something or I'm just

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,039
wrong and then we don't speak up and so

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,840
you have something like you know nobody

00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,899
else is saying anything so I guess it's

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,889
ok I was like oh we've always done it

00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:39,049
this way so it must be ok right or these

00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:41,539
people all beat all of these people seem

00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:46,600
to think it's fine so it must be fine

00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:49,429
right but as you probably have guessed

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,730
this very quickly leads to something

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,730
else

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,370
plural istic ignorance and this is when

00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:01,820
everybody in the room are doing the same

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,370
thing everybody in the room are looking

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:07,370
around everybody else and thinking ok

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:10,820
but nobody else is saying anything so I

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:13,039
guess it's funny this is this is a

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,620
situation where everybody has like a bad

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,600
feeling about this thing but nobody is

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,309
actually saying anything and this leads

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,730
to some interesting things like this

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:24,559
bystander syndrome comes from this

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,880
bystander syndrome is thing is is very

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,799
interesting and they've done lots of

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,600
studies and basically for your

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,419
information which might be useful to you

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,460
if you fall down and or you're sick or

00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:35,679
something happens do

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,159
you have a crisis in public you are much

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:44,590
more likely to get help if only one

00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:48,190
person saw you if more than one person

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:53,140
saw you the the chance that you will get

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:54,760
help at all plummets and this is really

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,140
surprising you would think like okay but

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,730
I have more people here so there's more

00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,020
chance that I will get help but the

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,510
thing is because of pluralistic

00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,010
ignorance those those people will look

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,809
at each other and see that nobody else

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:09,610
is doing anything and so it's probably

00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:11,799
fine you can break out of clear allistic

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,120
ignorance and this might be useful to

00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,370
you if you ever fall down and have a

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,820
stroke on the street it's basically to

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:23,020
to look somebody straight at them and

00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:26,080
say you called the call an ambulance I'm

00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,520
sick and that has to do with you are

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,580
calling out that it is an actual

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,950
emergency and that somebody has been

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,840
given responsibility and what do you see

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,730
them is that the whole bubble kind of

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:41,260
bursts and then everybody starts coming

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:43,330
in it's really crazy but this is also

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,860
what you see in many ethical situations

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,960
where when you come and you're

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,610
investigated later you realize yeah but

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,500
there were so many checks and balances

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:55,179
there were so many people who should

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,470
have said no but nobody did and that's

00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,230
because everybody was kind of waiting

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,570
for somebody else to say something so

00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:04,120
sometimes you have to be that person you

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:09,159
have to be the one who raises their hand

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:16,419
and says you know I was wondering is

00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:17,799
this really a good idea the idea that if

00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:27,340
it was bad somebody would have said

00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:29,950
something is just not true if you are

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,809
told by your boss to do something

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:39,570
unethical but legal what recourse do you

00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:42,130
have this is a problem we have in tech

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,510
because in many other industries like in

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,020
medicine and

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:49,090
in legal or in accounting or things like

00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,830
that they actually have ethical boards

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,750
they have licensing things you can have

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,210
you can lose your license if you do

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:58,150
something that is unethical even if it

00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,010
is legal we have no such protections if

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:03,100
your boss tells you to do something what

00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:06,430
recourse do you have well in Norway we

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:11,220
argue we have that privilege we can

00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:13,240
argue and we can argue a lot and and

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,640
oftentimes we can get away with it

00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,340
likely we might actually avoid doing it

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,420
but if our boss tells us to do it then

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:28,930
we basically either do it or we quit

00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:32,490
that's our options in the Volkswagen

00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:35,200
case an engineer went to jail

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:43,390
it wasn't an executive that went to jail

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:50,500
an engineer went to jail I was following

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:54,700
orders yeah we had a lot of history with

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:58,600
that one and the thing is it's happening

00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:02,350
right now right in the US ice is getting

00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:06,190
aided by technological companies to put

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:08,800
people in camps and the same thing

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,740
happened with tech companies and the

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:16,150
Nazis tech companies helped the Nazis to

00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:20,460
build databases over Jews this is not

00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,460
new we've been doing this for a while

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,700
but the thing that I came back to over

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,220
and over again when thinking about this

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,110
like how can we fix this is how are we

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,700
going to protect whistleblowers because

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,650
the thing is you are all by yourself

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,960
what if you see something that is really

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:41,410
bad inside of your company who is going

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,480
to protect you how are we going to

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:47,170
protect them seriously how are we going

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,460
to protect them because we are under

00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:53,530
NDA's right we are in a organization

00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,600
where we are not even allowed to tell

00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,600
anybody what the problem is

00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:06,250
so how did other disciplines look fix

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,260
this problem or try to solve this

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,269
problem and and basically they made

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,190
coastal ethics but we did that too

00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:16,779
there's been bunch they've been doing

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:18,610
that for for decades but they enforced

00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:21,460
them by unions and professional

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:24,640
associations and some of them even got

00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:27,760
them put into law but we don't have them

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:34,210
we are also really bad at being in

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:38,230
unions in tech oh sorry and and this is

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:40,389
something that we need to change because

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,130
we have no code of ethics we don't even

00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:46,090
we we don't even know what is right and

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:49,320
what is wrong we have nobody to evaluate

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:52,029
it even or and no consequences

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,380
besides you know maybe somebody doesn't

00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:55,419
want to hire you but then you just kind

00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:02,440
of remove the company from your CV and

00:28:55,419 --> 00:29:04,450
you just move on but the thing is do we

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,350
even know if we're harming people our

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,149
democracy because half of the time what

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:13,330
we're making is a component right we're

00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:16,419
making component to something else but

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,429
sometimes you have things like this like

00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:24,490
we make products to protect children

00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:26,470
I say protecting and quotes because

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,659
that's also debatable but we make

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,909
products to protect children that are

00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:34,360
used to control and abuse intimate

00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:36,220
partners and when you talk to these

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,880
people who work at these companies and

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,010
you tell them this they're shocked it's

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,630
like nobody thought that this could be

00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:48,190
used this way we're making image

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,850
recognition software that is used to

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,559
identify protesters I'm sure nobody

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,330
who's making that image recognition

00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:59,919
software ever thought that it would be

00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:02,139
used to identify and and jail protesters

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,679
protesting for the right to speak their

00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:04,679
mind

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:12,870
we are building the infrastructures of

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,540
our countries on hardware we can expect

00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:20,790
inspect and of binary blob drivers and

00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:22,620
firmware you know even if we think that

00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,690
our work is ok we're putting devices

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,790
inside of people's houses we're putting

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,430
devices in children's rooms we're

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:34,710
putting devices inside of people's

00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:42,000
bodies that we don't fully know what is

00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:44,160
there or what they do so people say oh

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,800
we need regulation we need more

00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:54,840
regulation but I've been talking to

00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:57,720
people who make laws and they don't have

00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,700
no idea how to regulate this they

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,040
believe our propaganda they believe that

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,870
this these machines like when I talk to

00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,090
them and I say okay yeah but we have

00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,400
problems for at around security of these

00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,930
computers they're Windows machines I

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,650
mean this is like the most popular

00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:15,750
operating system for malware and and and

00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:18,660
they look at me and they'll go like yeah

00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:29,610
but it's a machine you know machines

00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:31,860
they can count I don't know how to talk

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,300
to them I it's like they were like yeah

00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,040
but if you tell like I've had a

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,290
calculator like people say this there's

00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,330
like I have a calculator if I do 2 plus

00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,520
2 I get 4 and I'm like ok I'm a

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:45,000
programmer if you do 2 plus 2 I can make

00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,710
it be 5 every time because that's what

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,610
they also tell me yeah but the computer

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:54,470
gives the same answer every time and I

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:58,290
go like yeah we pride ourselves on that

00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:00,420
that's sort of what we do I mean if it

00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:08,100
wasn't deterministic we'd probably call

00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:11,420
it a bug even like the most simple

00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,420
things we can explain

00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:20,510
but there are some lights in the dark I

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,730
really love gdpr it's cost our industry

00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:25,100
a ton of money but it actually puts the

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,929
focus where it should be on the end-user

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:32,150
and their data and their right to

00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:33,830
control that data but then we have weird

00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,559
things like the reversion of net

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:40,570
neutrality or the EU copyright directive

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,570
which is weird

00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,580
so basically we're trapped in a

00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:48,110
situation where we're incapable of

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,590
regulating ourselves because we have

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,210
basically no power we're all individuals

00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,289
and we are unable to be regulated

00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,880
because the people who are supposed to

00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:57,409
regulate us they don't even understand

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,539
what we're doing they don't even

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:04,309
understand what we're saying and we're

00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:06,080
not able to have a public debate which

00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:08,090
we really should be having with the

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,220
population we should be like telling

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,440
them these are our problems what is it

00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,419
that we should do how can we best serve

00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,549
the general population but we're unable

00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,409
to have a public debate because the

00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:21,200
informed reporting is practically

00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:23,659
non-existent when you read articles

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:33,200
about computers they hardly ever make

00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:35,780
any sense at all why didn't we teach the

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,010
population we made a digital world and

00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:43,340
we made everybody live in it but we left

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:46,970
them illiterate in that world they don't

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,860
understand the world we made them live

00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,890
in

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:54,380
why didn't we teach the population could

00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:56,539
we even though could could you could you

00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,450
scale that could you basically say we're

00:33:56,539 --> 00:34:06,669
going to to upskill the whole population

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:06,669
of a country could we do that now

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:15,929
in the 90s Norway did an attempt at this

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:22,569
they had something called him a person

00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:24,339
Ian and dr. Gupta and yeah my person it

00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:26,980
was a tax rebate that you could get if

00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:29,079
you bought a computer in to have in your

00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,790
house it made it possible for a lot of

00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,440
people to buy a computer and have it in

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:37,089
their homes dr. Corvis was basically a

00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,399
certification for regular people on how

00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:41,139
to have basic computer skills and basic

00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:44,710
computer skills here basically meant can

00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:48,369
you use word and turn it on and off

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,200
again so anyone who sis admins is like

00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:52,119
you can bless this dot a quarter for

00:34:50,200 --> 00:35:00,430
people being able to turn it off and on

00:34:52,119 --> 00:35:03,790
again but but the thing is it stopped

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:06,190
there right these were the attempts made

00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:10,900
by the Norwegian government to make the

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:14,140
population computer literate but we

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,750
interpreted literacy in computers too

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,660
narrowly we've interpreted as being able

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:23,740
to operate a computer with a GUI

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:26,020
interface and also well you know we have

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,730
to be truthful about this our

00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:38,619
interpretation of computer literacy

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:42,609
means can you use Windows today most

00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:45,940
people own not one but many computerized

00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:48,010
devices they actually most people have

00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,589
many different operating systems running

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:53,230
in their houses many of them are are

00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:55,569
UNIX Ozora Linux is that they don't even

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,170
know is are there like inside of their

00:35:55,569 --> 00:36:01,359
fridge or their oven or their induction

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,160
countertop right we have so many

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,390
computerized devices in our homes and

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:09,540
now we're just putting them online

00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:09,540
because you know internet is good right

00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:15,010
but they don't understand them like

00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,160
regular people don't even understand

00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:20,319
what an operating system is I tried to

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,519
explain to people like what is what is

00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:24,939
Linux

00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:28,089
they're like okay so is that different

00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:37,089
buttons I don't know like it has

00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:39,459
something to do with computers right the

00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:42,039
problems that we have are fundamental

00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:43,989
and fundamental to our discipline is

00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:47,769
fundamental ethical questions who are

00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:50,199
really responsible for because what we

00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:54,569
are making is four people and those

00:36:50,199 --> 00:37:00,699
people become subject to our creations

00:36:54,569 --> 00:37:03,039
right we have fundamental problems but

00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:06,309
they are really difficult to grasp for

00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:13,329
regular people and we can't communicate

00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:15,699
with them but there are attempts this is

00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:18,339
one of the earliest the ACM code of

00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:21,399
ethics and professional conduct they try

00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:25,199
to make a code of ethics and then that's

00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:27,429
great you can write a paper but it but I

00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,779
tried to read all of these code of

00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:41,099
conducts and I think the most important

00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:41,099
part of this one is is one to avoid harm

00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:53,729
avoid harm sounds a lot like Google's

00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:53,729
don't be evil we all know how that went

00:37:54,959 --> 00:38:03,759
so avoid harm can we do that can we

00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:05,889
avoid harm why can we as individuals as

00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:08,380
professional in this business say that

00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:10,089
that is something that we can do that we

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,039
can stand for that when we're in the

00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:13,779
office and somebody says ok let's

00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,909
collect all of this personal information

00:38:13,779 --> 00:38:21,519
about our users and then sell it to an

00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:25,689
ad agency that we can say no I'm I'm an

00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:29,259
IT professional and we don't do that can

00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:33,059
we create that culture that we have

00:38:29,259 --> 00:38:33,059
certain things that we just don't do

00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:48,370
avoid harm so what did that regulation

00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:50,600
that other professionals professions did

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:54,200
how did that work like how did they

00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:56,150
build that like I said before Norway has

00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,920
a history of powerful unions and we

00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:02,060
don't appreciate that enough especially

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,810
in tech and the powerful unions in

00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,040
Norway have created so much of what is

00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,660
taken for granted when it comes to

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,480
workers rights in Norway you don't have

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,830
to be a you in a union because these

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,430
things have been slowly but surely

00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:20,330
pushed into law and regulation even if

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:22,250
you're not in a union you are you are so

00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:24,260
privileged from the work that these

00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,320
unions are put in to make sure that your

00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,090
workers protections are in place and

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:35,540
that's not true for many places in the

00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:38,390
world we could ask the unions that are

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,190
focused on tech to get together and make

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,920
a common ethics board because that's

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:45,080
what happened both with lawyers and with

00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,510
medicine and with with accounting in

00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:51,680
Norway they had ethics boards connected

00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:55,550
to unions with lawyers they even lay in

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,490
like relatively recently managed to put

00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:01,390
their ethics regulation into to an

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:04,490
actual regulation so it is now in law

00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:07,940
but it provides them protections as

00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:11,410
individuals because if someone asks you

00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:14,660
to do something unethical you have a

00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:18,550
protection to say no I can't do that

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:21,530
that is against my ethical obligations

00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:24,020
because we don't have that today and we

00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:26,030
have no place to go like what if someone

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,220
asks you to do something in unethical

00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,230
and you don't want to do it what do you

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:37,730
do you are trapped inside of your

00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:41,240
business the unions could protect

00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:44,690
whistleblowers give them access to to to

00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:48,020
lawyers give them access to more than

00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:51,500
they are themselves and and and we

00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:55,100
have the unions actually be the body

00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,770
that that that concentrates on the

00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:00,080
ethics of our industry and not the

00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,760
profitability of our industry so with

00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,470
because the thing is if you talk to

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,240
people in tech we all want to do the

00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:12,950
right thing we just don't know how to do

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:15,950
that and still get paid I'm sure you all

00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:18,200
feel that because I'm sure a very few of

00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:20,900
you actually managed to do BSD things

00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,760
and get paid for it and so it would be

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:31,550
nice if we could do the right thing and

00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:33,830
get paid at the same time but I want to

00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:37,100
give you something a little bit more

00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:43,850
hands-on that you can use today because

00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:45,920
this is more of a future vision but you

00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,780
have the problem of social proof if

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,540
everyone is looking to everyone else to

00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,460
see what is okay and what is not and you

00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,970
are the one person in the room who's

00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,040
feeling like this is not okay how do you

00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,930
do that in the meeting in the meeting

00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,330
when somebody saying we're going to sell

00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:05,030
all of our customers all of our end

00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:08,150
users personal data to the ad company

00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:12,859
who are you what do you say in that room

00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:20,000
to break through this seeming consensus

00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:24,859
that this is fine ask a very simple

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:29,660
question could you justify this to a

00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:32,990
journalist what will this look like on

00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:35,510
the front page of a newspaper would you

00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:38,180
be perfectly comfortable sitting down

00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:40,760
and saying to a journalist exactly why

00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,290
this is fine and some people might

00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,550
actually get past this one then we're

00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,930
like yeah I can probably trick a

00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,070
journalist because we already talked

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:50,030
about it they don't understand what

00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:51,590
we're saying so we're good used to just

00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:56,000
use some techie terms so it's like it's

00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:58,790
like I have no idea what to said um but

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,730
the problem is what will experts say

00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:05,299
because they will also read this

00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:07,819
in the newspaper right and the moment

00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:10,309
you start and lift your head above this

00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:12,019
particular contract and you look and you

00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:13,910
try to think how will this affect our

00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:17,089
brand how will this affect how people

00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:20,450
view us that is often enough to snap

00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:23,210
people out of it and people say you know

00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,549
what it's not worth it if we if this

00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,559
comes becomes front-page news on air or

00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:29,299
on oh it goes on Hacker News we're

00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:31,069
basically going to use lose all of our

00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:34,339
customers nobody's ever going to trust

00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:38,990
us again and that might be enough to

00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:48,380
break through and stop something without

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:50,059
having to risk too much but just pro tip

00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:55,390
from someone who's been doing this for a

00:43:50,059 --> 00:44:00,890
while if all else fails if rationality

00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:06,460
really doesn't work then perhaps try

00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:06,460
being annoying as a service thank you

00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,770
we do have some time for questions and

00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:32,320
there's a microphone there so if you

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:37,870

00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:41,650
mic nobody no sorry okay go get some
