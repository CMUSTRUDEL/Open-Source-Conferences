Title: Modernizing relayd & the road to HTTP 2 By Reyk Floeter

Description: 
	This talk is about my recent work to modernize relayd, to fix long-standing issues and limitations, and about the road to HTTP/2 in OpenBSD’s web stack.

relayd’s HTTP support dates back to early 2007, about three months after it was imported into OpenBSD for the first time. It was a necessary feature to complement relayd’s pf-based redirections with layer 7 load balancing for cookie-awareness, SSL acceleration, and basic header or URL filtering. The daemon has been improved, renamed, hardened, and widely deployed over the years.

Meanwhile, the web has changed a lot. While relayd is still a very useful tool, it had to get modernized to stay relevant. OpenBSD’s Claudio Jeker had updated the TLS support in 2017, and I added missing features such as TLS SNI and OCSP this year. Furthermore, I improved the protocol filters to offer greater flexibility when relaying HTTP traffic and I finally fixed a persistency bug that was a big show stopper for such filters.

But the most important step forward is HTTP/2. While the IETF was about to finalize the QUIC- and UDP-based HTTP/3, relayd and httpd were still based on the dated and text-based HTTP/1.1. I started my road to add HTTP/2 support to relayd and subsequently to httpd. This talk addresses the ongoing work of the implementation, awesome HPACK header compression, and challenges with HTTP/2 states and multiplexing.
