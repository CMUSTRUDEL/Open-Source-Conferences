Title: The OpenBSD Hypervisor in the wild, a short story.
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: EuroBSDCon 2019, Norway
Description: 
	OpenBSD Amsterdam started in the summer of 2018 after a poll on Twitter as an idea to start testing with vmm(4)/vmd(8). Mostly to see how far we could take it and more importantly to give back to the project. Little did we know where it would take us.

During this talk I will outline how it all started, how it’s build, how we operate the platform and what speedbumps we encountered.

We are a big proponent of using as much out of base as possible and it has influenced our design choices a lot. These choices will be highlighted when discussing how the platform is build and how it’s operated.
