Title: FreeBSD and the absurdities of security compliance
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: EuroBSDCon 2019, Norway
Description: 
	Assume absurdity, embrace sanity. Welcome to The Blame Game.
The world of security compliance is defined by a few key players: The ones writing the requirements, the ones covering their asses, and the ones who’ll be blamed in the end. Since about 2008 we’ve been firmly placed in the latter category, and despite the obvious downsides it is, really, where we prefer to be.

Security requirements pertaining to the payment industry include the various PCI standards, card system specific requirements, national and regional laws, regulations and directives, and whatever else comes to the minds of the various players. While there is sanity to be found in some of them, there is also plenty of absurdity. It is this, above all, that leads us to use the term “The Blame Game” about it all.

We do pretty much everything with FreeBSD. From routers (bsdrp) and firewalls (pfSense) to application- and database servers, we’re running FreeBSD everywhere. The only closed-source software we employ are our own applications (boo!). Our basic principle has always been to identify the root cause of a security requirement and then comply in a way that goes beyond “ticking the box”; whatever we do has to be useful and practical – and not something we’re ashamed to talk about.

What we want to show:
Compliance is much harder than security
but not because the tools can’t do it
Open Source, and FreeBSD, CAN be used to achieve compliance in the payment industry
If you implement sane security measures, compliance is nearly free
The hardest part is explaining what you’ve done and why

	00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,470
all right settling down so the good news

00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,520
is that you only have to listen to me

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,520
for a few more seconds

00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,520
applause

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,160
so please welcome Eric and he'll be

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:26,300
talking about the blame game or the

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,300
strangeness around security compliance

00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:34,189
[Applause]

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:55,200
like this yeah hey slightly scary this

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,899
so yeah welcome the talk was supposed to

00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,670
be the absurdities of compliance

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,530
freebase tea and the secrecy the

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:07,170
absurdities of security compliance this

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:11,240
is shorter it fit on the slide does this

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,829
even work of course not yeah found it

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,200
also it needs to be in range or

00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:28,880
something

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:28,880
whoa hey sort of this is very weird okay

00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:45,709
it's infrared right okay cool okay

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:55,270
yeah yeah away with you

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:59,750
so what I want to cover the power button

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,340
there we go so I want to say something

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,899
about the business were in

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,319
just a little bit about the security

00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:08,539
standards that we have been exposed to

00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,989
throughout the years

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:14,450
 auditors said that's looking back a

00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:17,930
bit a little bit about how it looks

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,090
nowadays and then auditors are still

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,769
saying so might say something about

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,750
that our approach and the tools we use

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,420
I'm not going to spend too much time on

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,340
that because I have no idea what I could

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,900
possibly be telling you guys but we'll

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,989
find out and then some ideas some advice

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,700
for the future if you end up in this

00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:42,349
situation I'm here because I've been

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,610
used for using FreeBSD since the early

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:48,709
2000s privately mostly ever since i

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,870
remote upgraded my Slackware to freebsd

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:54,310
that was all sorts of fun I was bored at

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:59,810
work I absolutely love open-source

00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:01,849
especially our variety of it the type of

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,310
help I'm getting from the community in

00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:08,480
my daily work is incredible I absolutely

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,489
love it I was I landed in the payment

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,019
industry in 2003 I had no idea where I

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:18,079
was going to as pure coincidence

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:20,299
incredibly steep learning curve when it

00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:23,329
comes to the security requirements it

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:26,599
was truly wild west from my perspective

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:28,130
in the beginning and I'd like to try and

00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,680
show how it's become a little bit west

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:34,340
world I'm not sure I'm succeeding idea

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,370
being someone thinks they're in control

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,180
now but when they lose it it's gonna

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,560
blow up bad

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,940
but that's for another time and I've

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,340
been speaking about this for years

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,650
mostly over beers to people who probably

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,900
didn't care so let's see how this works

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:56,930
out modern my company has been doing

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,680
in-house developed software and hosted

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:03,659
it on FreeBSD since around

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,329
three all my fault when you're shopping

00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,060
online and you're asked to authenticate

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,129
in some way or other here in Norway to

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,540
typically be using Bank ID these

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,989
national ID schemes you will have

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,639
similar things in other countries or

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,949
simple boring stuff like a password or

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,039
an OTP sent to you via SMS something

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,960
like that that typically hits us or one

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:30,389
of our competitors because what we do is

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:33,139
we help the bank's authenticate you as

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,630
card holders during the payment process

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:40,289
we make software for everyone involved

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,759
in a payment process the banks on one

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:44,370
side then you have the merchants and

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,169
processors like Amazon and PayPal on the

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,550
other side of the pond and then you have

00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:51,389
the card companies in the middle trying

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,460
to keep control of everything this

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,340
particular protocol that allows this to

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,960
happen is called 3d secure some of you

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,900
might have heard of it it's also known

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,550
as verified by Visa MasterCard secure

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,400
code back in the day they all change

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:11,490
names now sorry yeah so the whole idea

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,289
is to let the bank's intercept the

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,550
payment process so that they can make

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,110
sure that you're allowed to use

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,650
whichever card you're currently trying

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,780
to use when you when you pay the banks

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,530
will sell it to you guys as cardholders

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,419
as secu for your security it really has

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,889
nothing to do with that this is all

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,780
about shifting blame elsewhere someone

00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,030
did something absolutely brilliant back

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,539
in the day sorry I went too fast here

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,840
there when this protocol was implemented

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,729
they gave all the web shops all the

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,220
merchants out there a huge carrot if

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,590
they even tried to make use of this

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,060
protocol they would automatically lose

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,680
90% of the risk with online transactions

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,090
which meant that all this risk that had

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,080
traditionally been on the merchants was

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:03,180
shifted to the banks so the banks had to

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,009
you know scramble to him to implement

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,659
some sort of authentication and not all

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,090
of them are able to do that but they can

00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:10,800
choose freely how to do this which is

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,550
why we have some really crazy

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,190
authentication schemes out there in

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,920
loading please wait operate it from the

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,750
bank is going to call you and then you

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,160
have to wait until you get that phone

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,780
call and then they will ask you okay

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,850
what are you up to and then they might

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,760
allow your transaction or not that's

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,200
quite common in the u.s. at least it

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,000
used to be and now we have this

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,250
beautiful new PSD payment service

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,630
directive - in Europe which means that

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,550
they have to implement strong

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,440
authentication not going to spend time

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,370
on that but it's a good thing

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,050
finally and there nowadays trying to use

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,520
to risk look at your payment history and

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,790
all that stuff to figure out if the CVC

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:59,440
is even necessary but too much about

00:06:48,790 --> 00:07:01,180
that this is what we do I have spent too

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,950
much time comparing myself to you know

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,560
doctors who save lives than that sort of

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,740
thing but that's what we do so sorry

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,740
about that

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:15,340
in online payments worlds that I'm

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,320
exposed to you have these three players

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,690
you have the guys who decide how we are

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,120
supposed to do things then you have

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,280
pretty much everyone trying to cover

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,670
their asses in some way or other usually

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,900
by pointing fingers and then it's us and

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,000
we're like at the bottom of the food

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,100
chain is when when all the blame has

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,940
been shifted somewhere it finds its way

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:41,140
to us somehow I said in my abstract that

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:43,030
we prefer to be there that's probably

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,010
because we haven't been hit really hard

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,490
yet I might change my mind about that

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,760
but so far at least it means we can own

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,700
our own mistakes so that is the one nice

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,380
thing about it we have a whole bunch of

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,530
security requirements that apply to us

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,880
the most important one that some of you

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,510
or many of you might have heard of is

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:08,830
the PCI DSS payment card industry data

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,450
security standard it is supposed to

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,540
cover all the payment industries

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,430
including this hotel and us and any

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,670
merchants online anyone handling card

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,860
numbers there are so many exceptions to

00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,440
that that it's not even funny but we're

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,380
subject to that one and it has a sort of

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,240
a sibling called the 3ds as in the 3ds

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,710
your specific requirements then we have

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,060
the different payment schemes we some

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,289
also go and the others they have their

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,830
own idea of how things should be done

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,060
then we have legal requirements that's

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,800
it's always been there but it's only

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,320
recently been enforced in any meaningful

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,800
way so we're actually somewhat grateful

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,100
for that

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,470
it helps a bit and then every customer

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,970
again they need to cover their asses so

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,110
they might have to make it look like

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,210
they're inventing some sort of

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,070
requirements that we have to follow so

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,890
that we have done something wrong when

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,050
 hits the fan

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:02,920
so yeah the Wild West

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:04,540
that's a while ago so no relevant

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,110
security requirements that were being

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:10,450
enforced maybe except in the US but not

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,990
even really there it was just everyone

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,720
did whatever they wanted there were so

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,140
many cases of fraud and fallout of

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,000
various kinds they're all it's like it's

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,380
like violence and theft and stuff back

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,040
in the day you didn't hear about it

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,660
because you know no Twitter back then

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,550
you had all this stuff but it didn't

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,560
usually make it to the news because

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,020
online shopping or still kind of tiny

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,310
but I haven't I don't have the numbers

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,780
but I'm pretty sure that a larger

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,430
percentage of transactions were

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,730
fraudulent back then than they are now a

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:46,120
huge by a huge margin server under the

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,800
desk the industry was literally

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,900
scared about that and there were so many

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,310
of them I mean I've been in a company

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,600
where we have servers under people's

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,190
desk it doubled as a developer

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,560
workstation so yeah and then you have

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,720
the you know all the receipts tax in

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,600
shops in hotels you know you have these

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,580
receipts stuck on a pin with full card

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,560
data or even they ask you to write down

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,700
your card number expiry date and this

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,090
code on the back of the so called

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,430
password that they come up with it's

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,540
it's absolutely crazy and crypto really

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:21,730
who has time for that

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:24,460
as in CPU time really so we got some

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:28,240
requirements PCI DSS was an attempt to

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:35,650
have a coherent approach to all this but

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:39,939
it stank it was again lots of copy-paste

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:41,709
and basically none of the auditors had

00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:44,919
really any idea about this but they were

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:48,039
well-paid so they were ticking boxes for

00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,629
you so-called qualifying auditors they

00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,519
were popping up everywhere some of them

00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:52,899
were you know in the business for three

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,249
or four months so they were auditing a

00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:56,919
few companies giving you prefilled

00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:58,559
pieces of paper taking a bunch of money

00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,909
and then they disappeared again

00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,399
absolutely terrible then you had the

00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:04,659
Visa 3d secure acquirements they were

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,789
actually kind of interesting because

00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,470
they were based on the physical card

00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:10,509
world which has been there for a long

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,059
time so these requirements were more

00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:15,629
mature more thought through a bit

00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:17,709
overkill given that you know this was no

00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:20,049
producing cards and shipping them by

00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:22,869
mail and that sort of thing but at least

00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:24,549
they were strung together but we had

00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:28,720
some interesting audits anyway not

00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:31,359
entirely terrible but it got so bad

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,119
because suddenly the card companies they

00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:36,009
had to start fighting for attention

00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:37,299
because you had the PCI taking over and

00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,159
you had all sorts of other requirements

00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:42,699
taking over and the card companies

00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:46,119
themselves started being less and less

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,999
relevant in the security requirements

00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:52,419
and they didn't like that at all

00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:56,259
so I mean I like this picture yes

00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:58,119
it's by the book so some of the things

00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:01,479
we've experienced this is the first part

00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:03,069
of the absurdities thing we've been

00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:05,559
asked to look for data that cannot

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:07,269
possibly exist again requirements come

00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,249
from a different world the world of

00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,679
physical cards we have the magnet strip

00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:14,709
on the back so even though we're doing

00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,829
only online stuff we've been forced to

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:22,269
use various approaches to looking for

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:24,369
stripe data on our servers it we do look

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:26,319
for card numbers stored in log files and

00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:29,349
all that sort of thing that's easy but

00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:31,959
the stripe data now that's hard we had

00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:35,109
people come and take pictures with their

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,970
phones I mean back in 2005 ish sixes

00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:38,349
forms and cameras interesting

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,029
combination they came into the data

00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:43,239
center when the pictures of my password

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:46,749
files because that should prove that the

00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:48,519
passwords are encrypted and then so at

00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:51,039
some point we were asking for an auditor

00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,779
that knew UNIX and I said I will use

00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,500
grep to look for card numbers yeah man I

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,610
you have to

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,790
document that graphic and do regular

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,530
expressions believe it or not one of the

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,560
big card companies published a set of

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:05,950
official regular expressions to look for

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,480
card data and they suggested we got this

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,120
tool I don't remember what it was called

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,820
spider or something some alpha build for

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,930
FreeBSD existed binary blob they wanted

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:19,510
us to run this I suggested using grep

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:24,990
yeah we did use grep because we don't

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:31,030
run untrusted binaries usually but yeah

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:34,540
yes that's the binary blob we were two

00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:37,060
guys we had an office about a third of

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,190
this stage but yes we had to have a

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,020
visitor bad system for our office

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,310
because otherwise we couldn't be sure

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,560
that whoever was in the office was

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,560
actually employed in our company or not

00:13:51,360 --> 00:14:00,089
oh this is my absolute favorite and

00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:02,279
auditor was connected here to to the big

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,230
you know projector like this like I am

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,939
now and he was bringing up our

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,649
documentation on his laptop he was

00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:13,829
typing in a URL in in his browser and he

00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,569
thought he had focus on his screen too

00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:17,970
bad focus was over there in the browser

00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:25,649
window he had there so he got his

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:28,379
browser history so this was the first PC

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,569
I or did we ever had and the auditor

00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:33,119
took the pictures he took all the

00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:35,069
screenshots from our wiki all the

00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:38,059
scanned documents and stuck in a folder

00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:42,779
on this desktop of his windows XP laptop

00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:45,029
next to a folder for 1 2 3 10 15 20 of

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:48,179
our competitors customers other banks

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:50,189
etc etc and then he brought up his

00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,220
browser history on the same level I

00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:58,169
absolutely loved that when they asked

00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:02,100
yes top-level level 1 yeah

00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:03,720
so when after the audit I called the

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,419
boss of this guy and told him about this

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,369
story he just said I think you will not

00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:16,499
be receiving a quote from us for next

00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:18,509
year so the low point of my career was

00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,949
after a lot of back and forth with these

00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:21,239
requirements and they were developing

00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:23,189
and it was getting difficult and

00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:24,629
especially the ones from visa they have

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:27,059
they have essentially three large

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:29,309
regions in the world and they each have

00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,709
their own auditing authorities it's the

00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,739
same document but different authorities

00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:36,480
with different interpretations which

00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:40,410
meant that our competitors who were

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,679
usually in the US or Asia or somewhere

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,360
they had reasonable auditors that would

00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,189
go in and say ok this is the security

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,459
problem you have to solve how did you do

00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:53,489
it while the guys from we say Europe

00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:55,079
they did not so we went there to talk to

00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:56,790
them and explain this since I hate

00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,319
you're making our lives really difficult

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,689
because we have to do things that are

00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:04,860
absolutely absurd this was the response

00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:07,620
I got we are not in the business of

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,890
all playing fields they didn't care and

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,960
they had no interest in caring the same

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,510
guys also told us our but we don't audit

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,220
you for the money we're only taking

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,410
fifteen thousand euros of you for the

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,870
privilege of being audited plus the time

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,250
and material of the auditor plus a

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,860
hundred thousand euros protects money

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:30,350
every year so you know but not in it for

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,350
the money at all love that

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:39,960
so as time goes by and the requirements

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:44,120
develop some of them grow up the PCI DSS

00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:49,050
is getting better it is currently a

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:53,220
decent security standard our audits tend

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:55,530
to be useful to us we find stuff we fix

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,440
it we have we get help and everything

00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:02,480
and they are not as locked down to a

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:05,550
Windows group policy as they used to be

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,040
more problem focused and solution focus

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,630
as in they don't tell you how to do

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,460
things as much as they used to but what

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:15,720
the problem is and the type of approach

00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:18,110
you should have and you can actually do

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,910
stuff on other platforms than Windows

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,260
but they still have a password policy in

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,800
there that sucks and that you simply

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,950
cannot do on freebsd which i'm getting

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,390
back to they've the other set of

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,160
requirements from visa they are so

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,760
absurd at this point that you cannot

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,610
even read them they have copy pasted

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,260
stuff from their own documents indenting

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,420
doesn't make sense grammatically it

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,750
doesn't make sense you're it's like

00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:49,800
making pigs fly it just cannot you

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:53,690
cannot confirm there is no way logically

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:56,370
impossible and they actively reduce

00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:00,360
security and this is my favorite kind of

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:04,320
requirement of course a colleague of

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,510
mine said what they asked us to do was

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,080
that we have to have a strong password

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:12,900
on the root account we cannot disable

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,880
the root account entirely because the

00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,710
requirement says you need a password and

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,419
that password needs to be split in two

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:23,359
halves and given to two different

00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:26,330
people so it's like telling us sorry

00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,429
telling us to take a slowly brick wall

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,859
is put in a door with a strong lock on

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:36,570
it my preference would still be the

00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:38,429
brick wall but you know this is probably

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,830
the one time I've outright lied to an

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:44,570
auditor and said yes we did this we've

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,570
never had passwords for root really

00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:54,830
these guys these guys go for naming not

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:57,840
numbering I get it

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,269
another nice absurdity was when they

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,629
told us so I mentioned before

00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:06,419
OTPs via SMS one-time passwords when

00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:08,190
you're shopping or something these guys

00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,690
didn't understand that this is

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,309
fundamentally different from a static

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,830
password when you use the same password

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,799
all the time so they told us you have to

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:20,070
secure this OTP the same way you would

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,529
secure a password which means you have

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,239
to use an HSM to encrypt them now for

00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,039
those who don't know an HSM is one of

00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:29,730
these crypto units that someone else I

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,529
spoke about earlier they cost a lot of

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,179
money they're either a PCI card with

00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:35,399
some physical security on them or it's a

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,210
network mounted unit we use the network

00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:41,940
mount the rack mounted variety they cost

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:46,350
eighty thousand euros apiece and they

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:48,090
suck they're slow and the only thing

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,580
they're good at is keeping our keys

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,379
secret and that's because they have

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,759
explosives inside so if you try to take

00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:58,470
it out of the AK stuff will blow up

00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:01,639
inside it that's kind of cool so how do

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:06,480
we encrypt an OTP and send it to someone

00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:09,029
do is ship an HSM to everyone I mean you

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,409
have like 15 kilos of a too-sami new

00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:12,029
pocket that we pull out every time you

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:20,370
know that doesn't work obviously

00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:23,470
oh we're we've done that we've done that

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,900
there was a time the the supply would

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,270
not under any circumstance ship these

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,100
ATMs to Tallinn Estonia this is a part

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,380
of the EU but they were so afraid of

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,030
this because it sounded Eastern Bloc and

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,900
all that so they refused to ship them so

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,070
they ship to Norway

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:43,150
put them in there our check-in luggage

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:46,360
and we flew over yes receive been

00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:48,490
carrying HSM oh and of course auditors

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,200
not understanding how TLS works that you

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,710
have a server and a client the server

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,560
decides on the crypto but if we're

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,870
sending stuff to someone they decide on

00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,600
the crypto then we can't make sure that

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,220
using an HSM so the auditor told us yeah

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:09,130
but how about you me the server and they

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:16,060
be the client how do you even compute

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:20,170
that yeah exactly so is there some sort

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:22,270
of sanity coming they're gone the

00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,980
requirements room from all the card

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,890
brands own requirements are basically

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,870
gone because the PCI has grown up and

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,150
taken over all this stuff they all

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:35,140
agreed that ok we like we use the PCI

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:39,430
standards the all of them sort of to

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:42,100
achieve much the same and it has the PCI

00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:44,500
has gotten this new extension covering

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,640
what we do what we saw I used to ask for

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:53,140
and the others and then we got

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:56,560
regulation that is almost same GTR is

00:21:53,140 --> 00:22:00,940
awesome for the consumer for people in

00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,410
general PSD to tears down some of these

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,730
walls that all the banks and other

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,860
others in the business have been

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,320
building up to keep business in their

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,690
own hands so it's funny I'm getting

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,300
mails from my bank now telling me I can

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,970
use one online bank to check that my

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,850
accounts in another bank because they

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,770
had to open up api's and everything to

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,040
talk between the banks this is awesome I

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:26,200
mean it's a tiny island of Awesome but

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,030
is still awesome I like it and it helps

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,190
guide all these requirements and temper

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:33,010
them so all the requirements that come

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,320
out of the u.s. they are tempered

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,580
by European regulation which means there

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,380
are some things that even though it's

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,330
required of us we simply cannot do it

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:46,510
like having a camera behind my back in

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:49,750
my office that sort of thing but you

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,610
still have auditors from hell that

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,280
really do not understand what they're

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,530
talking about they have no idea which

00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:00,160
means they either have a checklist there

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:02,140
you asked to fill out or you have you

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,160
have to take them to school through

00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,970
every single requirement and this is so

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:13,180
tiresome and then even though they've

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:15,040
sort of given up control the card

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,420
companies they haven't really so then

00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,510
inventing all sorts of other ways to

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:21,130
keep control this is the West world so

00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,870
they think they're in control they're

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:26,980
not really so they don't even know when

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:28,630
things start slipping and then you all

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,100
still have all the people who are trying

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,450
to cover their own RSS they haven't

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,010
understood that all they need is a

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,320
certification that we passed a certain

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,810
set of requirements so they invent their

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,660
own and that's usually copied and pasted

00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:43,750
just stuff in a different order but it's

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,730
still mostly based on some ancient PCI

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:51,730
so it might not even be compatible

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:53,740
anymore so we've literally been asked to

00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,320
specify the kind of lighting we have

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,600
outside our premises and in this case

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,130
our office actually which is completely

00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:06,370
irrelevant and we still don't know sorry

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:08,980
why they asked this we have no idea but

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,900
we have to try and find out somehow how

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,020
does how often does please patrol

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,120
outside our offices how should I know

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,220
this is not the u.s. where you can pay

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,490
the local sheriff to check by a couple

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,200
of times a day do you have a priority

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,150
phone number for the emergency services

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,070
in your area I was so pissed off when I

00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,410
got this one in my lap because there's a

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,570
hotel across the road please go there

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,000
first if there's a fire go to the hotel

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:39,670
don't care about us I don't care people

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,910
don't die and when you have a guy coming

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:45,070
into your office and he and his bosses

00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,170
have already decided that your business

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,570
is worth sorry the date

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:52,510
you process for them is worth 400

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,040
million u.s. dollars that is a very big

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,200
number anyone would be interested when

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,990
they see such a number so he has this on

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,820
a piece of paper it says modern MD pay

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,980
and our address phone numbers everything

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:07,020
on top and then it says the the name of

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:10,570
the bank you know huge US Bank

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,460
everyone's heard of it and the the four

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,350
hundred million USD is also in big fat

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,360
letters so you can see this from 100

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,000
meters away and this is in his briefcase

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,320
and he's carrying this through the

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,870
airport and his next stop is st.

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,570
Petersburg this is the single biggest

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,950
liability that our company has ever been

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,470
exposed to I'm sorry I'm trying to find

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,930
that oh never mind because imagine

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,330
someone seeing that document it's about

00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,590
a company in Holland and it's four

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,740
hundred million dollars if you can get

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:44,560
our hands on one percent of that data

00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,210
and we can get one percent of the value

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,580
of that data you can still pay a lot of

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:55,000
hackers and hookers and whatever else

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:57,940
you need in order to get to us so war

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,640
stories and all that how have we gone

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,380
about doing this and as I said before I

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,240
don't think I can teach a lot of you a

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:08,170
lot about freebsd so I won't even go

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,300
there but feel free to ask so it's about

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:14,280
thinking about security first and then

00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:19,030
compliance it's not free but it's easier

00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,650
mostly that one if you can show that you

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,350
don't even trust yourself that goes a

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:25,030
long way towards convincing your auditor

00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:28,270
that at least you don't trust anyone

00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:30,450
else you shouldn't be trusting and this

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,910
one has got me out of so much trouble

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:35,890
that we we might choose solution that

00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:39,130
don't necessarily follow people's

00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:41,980
expectations but being able to explain

00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:45,040
why we've done certain things that's a

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,140
big deal because it means it it helps

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,780
show that you have understood the

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,270
underlying challenge and you've solved

00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,910
that it doesn't matter exactly how and

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,280
you have to be able to show that your

00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:59,140
choice is deliberate you have to be able

00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,490
to show that this is the end of a

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,350
thought process not

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:06,490
the thought process started when the

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:07,660
auditor raised the question if you can

00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,740
think quick enough to come up with

00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:13,110
something at that point then you're

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:15,580
really good I would like to hire you and

00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,770
this is something that always brings a

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,900
lot of discussion and this depends very

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,120
much on what industry you're in and what

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,500
kind of data you have and what kind of

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,620
attack vectors and everything but

00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,150
generally it kind of sucks to find out

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,250
three years down the line that you had

00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,380
three four or five audits everyone said

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,970
it was almost hunky-dory and then

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,550
someone's been in your systems all the

00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,230
time because as soon as you have an

00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,580
audit and you pass you think everything

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,520
is fine because whatever was there you

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,020
must have found it by now right

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,250
so people spend a lot of time trying to

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,820
prevent a break-in but if you already

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:50,950
had if you find an open hole in your

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,450
wall it's not enough to plug it you have

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,300
to go check if anyone actually got in

00:27:52,450 --> 00:28:00,309
and surprisingly many don't get this

00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:06,130
so detect before you try spend too much

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:09,760
time trying to prevent because yeah you

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:11,410
should of course try to do both but we

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,690
have our servers in a data center we

00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:16,270
have a rack in the data center with our

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,559
stuff and at some point I just have to

00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,240
say yeah whatever the data center is

00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,400
doing it's okay if someone managed to

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,410
get to my rack and get to our equipment

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,640
they're probably there with a forklift

00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:29,830
anyway what can I do so no amount of you

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:36,250
know kernel auditing is going to help

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:39,760
you them and dual control physical dual

00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:42,520
control goes a long way to convincing an

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,090
auditor that what you're doing is okay

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,010
because especially in a small company

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:51,760
when you have to share hats you wear a

00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:53,620
lot of hats if you have dual control

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,900
meaning that you need to be two

00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,570
different people from the company to

00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,340
access your server rack for example it

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,950
means you can show with a very high

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,360
degree of certainty that no one has been

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,429
playing around there on their own and

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,860
then make sure that whatever you really

00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:10,840
want dual control for you can't do

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,610
remotely so this is one of the nice

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,080
things with the network month there

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,059
rack mounted HSM there are certain

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,910
things you simply cannot do you cannot

00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:21,070
remotely insert a smart card in it to do

00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,990
administration administrative operation

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:26,530
you can't remotely turn physical Keys

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:29,410
this is very visual but it it's also

00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:37,210
very nice to just close of entire

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:39,520
categories or requirements so the tools

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,049
we use I didn't say so before but we

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,420
have been putting a lot of effort into

00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:45,790
just staying open source all the way so

00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,280
a lot of these auditing requirements

00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:51,190
will assume that you're using some sort

00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,929
of commercial tools for various parts of

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,910
your compliance work we didn't do that

00:29:52,929 --> 00:30:00,190
so lately we even have our routers on

00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:02,950
BSD which is really nice I I really like

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,020
that the only closed source software we

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,870
have is the stuff we develop ourselves

00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:11,880
and you may boo I think it sucks but

00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,880
then again I've seen the source it's ok

00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:19,809
so probably the the one the most

00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:24,070
important underpinning of being able to

00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:26,559
comply is about providing forensics data

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,990
when hits the fan and that's where

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,970
the kernel audit logs come in I'm gonna

00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,740
complain about them in a couple of

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,169
slides but they're really really

00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,570
important and it's it's easy to turn on

00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:42,820
it's very hard to do anything useful

00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:44,590
with them then we use freebies the

00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,790
update and pkg I remember spending a

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,309
couple of weeks trying to implement

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,890
tripwire at a point this is very long

00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:53,860
time ago before we had these tools but

00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,809
those actually do almost everything you

00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,040
need them to do they can check the

00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,419
integrity of what you have installed as

00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,679
long as you don't build your own kernel

00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:03,370
and world and everything it's actually

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,290
quite ok pkg does its job you need to

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,630
know a little bit of what you've done

00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,760
yourself and keep track of this but they

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,830
can do it

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:15,669
PCI requires a web application firewall

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:17,500
I think the concept is weird but mod

00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:21,940
security you can actually do that with

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:23,320
nginx now on stock FreeBSD and it works

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,840
surprisingly well we have some

00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,260
interesting cases where nginx will blow

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,810
up too

00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,270
twelve gigabytes memory usage per worker

00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,740
or something but it looks good now one

00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:37,660
of my colleagues is maintaining the live

00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,860
mode security port MySQL for data Oracle

00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,330
actually told us at the point that we

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,010
have the second-largest MySQL

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,230
installation in the world I don't think

00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:47,830
that's true any longer but it's pretty

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:51,310
big I think we're handling like 5 times

00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:55,980
15 terabytes online storage at any given

00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:59,080
time and MySQL can actually log access

00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,790
but good luck finding in that documented

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,530
anywhere you can actually do it it's you

00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,300
can log to syslog and it gives you

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:09,670
everything a PCI auditor will ask for

00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:11,350
surprisingly pfSense sericata tools that

00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:16,110
most of you will know on some level or

00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:18,670
other puppet for config management ZFS

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,340
whenever puppet runs in one of our jails

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,630
it will tell the hosts to snapshot to

00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,730
jail before it proceeds and if that

00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,110
fails it will just bomb out that is very

00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:31,390
nice when you have to show rollback

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:33,580
capability love put rear and bond trail

00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,800
and all that it's nothing really out of

00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,050
the ordinary the kernel auditing is the

00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,730
only thing that we're kind of struggling

00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:46,300
with and that a lot of people probably

00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:49,330
don't use check the main page it will

00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:53,110
give you lots of data but you can tell

00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:57,550
it only you know save away some of it so

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:59,440
be careful with that don't try to do a

00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,390
lot with the data on the server where

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,510
you're collecting it get it out of there

00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:07,840
and process it elsewhere one exception

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:11,230
being BSM trace which is seriously

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,080
undervalued it can look at the events

00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:16,810
from the audit pipe and tell you when a

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,140
certain chain of events happen so for

00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:22,390
example if the triple W user just Forks

00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:25,260
a process that is bad

00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,970
that means someone all my Tomcat and

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,800
that is a beautiful way of showing that

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,340
hey I will pick it up if someone gets in

00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,750
that way

00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:34,480
you can do similar things with the you

00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:37,720
know nginx users or whatever and that is

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,240
pretty simple or brute-force login

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,679
attempts that sort of thing so

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,080
check it out it's cute but I'll get to

00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,399
that so you have different philosophies

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,960
in the industry I'm sorry I'm going a

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:55,120
bit faster and someone showed me a sign

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:58,690
here so probably the biggest one here is

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,580
again they need you to have to store

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,769
away the last ten passwords it's used

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,570
for a user on the system I don't know

00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:08,649
how to do that on FreeBSD 15 years later

00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:10,990
I still don't everyone expects a large

00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:13,030
organization we started out as two

00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:16,780
people now we're eight in our hosting

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:18,460
business doing the work and it's still

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,399
small compared to what a lot of the

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,500
auditors expect it's not very

00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:25,569
open-source friendly because you cannot

00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,569
be create links with open source because

00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:30,909
Linux comes with corporate stuff so

00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:32,530
although the software is technically

00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:37,510
open-source they don't like the

00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:38,560
open-source community also because all

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,359
these HSMs

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,040
they require drivers and that sort of

00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,829
stuff unless you use the network units

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,599
that kind of sucks

00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:49,210
and just because you're compliant

00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:54,089
doesn't mean you're secure and vice

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:54,089
versa so you have to keep an eye on both

00:34:54,629 --> 00:35:01,150
interpretation everyone will interpret

00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,829
the standard differently even to

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,619
auditors from the same company shall

00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:07,200
appear mentioning names will have wildly

00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:09,040
different interpretation of the same

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,839
requirements so make sure you know it

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,660
before they do what the requirement

00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:17,020
actually says and choose your auditor

00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:19,270
wisely for PCI you can actually choose

00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:23,829
your auditor which is nice which means

00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:25,599
you can make sure their technical make

00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:28,089
sure they understand technical things

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,710
because this is technical anyone who

00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:31,660
tells you differently is wrong yes

00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,130
there's a lot of business processes and

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,640
all that stuff but at the end of the day

00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,250
its technical how will your auditor

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,690
handle alternative solutions if you

00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,030
haven't done something by the book what

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,020
have you done are they able to interpret

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:49,800
and understand what you have done and

00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,150
will they help you find a solution

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,740
sometimes the auditor will say I can't

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:57,790
but my colleague over here can

00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:59,770
and that is perfectly fine do the dust

00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,540
Auditor trust their own judgment this is

00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:05,080
probably the hardest one because they

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:09,400
again are part of the blame game so if

00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,720
we're broken our auditor will burn so

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,000
does the order to trust their own

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,680
judgment well enough to actually give

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,200
you a pass even if you haven't followed

00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:21,609
the letter but actually solve the

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,470
problem and if someone wants you about a

00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:25,690
particular auditor you should listen to

00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,450
them because that usually means there is

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,910
something you need to look out for but

00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:34,660
if someone recommends you an auditor

00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:37,660
that doesn't come often then you really

00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:40,599
should listen and you are the client

00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,790
you're paying their bills so even though

00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,800
you can't demand compliance you can

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:52,330
demand qualified people I'm not sure

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,710
what else I really can do about that but

00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:57,310
then you have the situations where you

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:59,770
cannot choose your auditor which means

00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,170
you will get some random guy chemistry

00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:05,130
is everything it can go down the drain

00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:08,980
the moment you shake the guy's hand but

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:11,109
don't ask you so explain what you've

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,109
done early and your key concepts I mean

00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:16,990
your decision your design choices etc

00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:20,440
and be prepared to use generic

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:24,820
terminology if they call your platform

00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:27,190
Linux don't don't get too upset it's

00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:30,400
going to happen they're gonna think it's

00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,630
a linux and don't talk about jails if

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
they clearly don't understand what

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,330
you're talking about but everyone

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,220
understand virtual virtual machines and

00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:43,660
think that's a good thing so play them

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:47,530
like that dammit almost every

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:50,050
requirement stems from the PCI DSS so do

00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,910
your homework read their requirements

00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,589
and find out where they come from so you

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,990
can show that yeah this has already been

00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:59,650
asked and we did it like this because

00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,700
it's already covered they all come from

00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,680
the same place but they might be

00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,280
different generations of requirements so

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,020
it can be interesting anyway they will

00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,420
tip

00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,610
they recognize your PCI certificate but

00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,080
not necessarily it depends if they know

00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:17,010
someone on the board in which case they

00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:19,950
might not it's it is a somewhat small

00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:26,130
industry and you people have spoken to

00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:27,870
each other so I have a couple of

00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,440
complaints about the current state of

00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:35,730
affairs the kernel auditing stuff is

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,830
awesome but it's not done there's not a

00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,230
lot of good documentation or examples I

00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:42,060
mean if you look at the the trusted BSD

00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:45,840
website for example it's so old it's not

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:48,960
even funny I'm not sure a lot of people

00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:52,050
are using this who's using the auditing

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,820
framework in any capacity excellent one

00:38:52,050 --> 00:39:00,180
to a few not a lot and come on

00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:02,880
I don't know wait what 20 years in and

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:05,760
we still don't lock the jail ID of

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,360
something that's happening this is just

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,610
not okay but I've been yelling about

00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,320
that for 15 years now and nothing's

00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:16,500
happening so I am yelled in the right

00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,270
direction I guess package base I know

00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,030
there was a talk about that here just

00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,590
before I came on I was panicking over

00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,320
there so I didn't get it someone

00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:27,840
summarized for me but I really looked

00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,730
forward to that and then it's the whole

00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,730
jail orchestration thing there's a lot

00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:34,380
of interesting work going on there I

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:36,570
have a colleague he's working very hard

00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,490
on getting things to work I can't wait

00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,170
for that but that's something that we

00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,630
should have had a while the Train sort

00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,960
of it's it's out there somewhere we

00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:47,340
really need to catch up but we have the

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,200
basic technology in place and it's

00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:54,420
beautiful so thank you everybody

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,360
everyone who's been contributing awesome

00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,740
work organizers of this event thank you

00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,160
very much it's been very exciting

00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,990
everyone else

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,710
pitching in in some way or other my

00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:09,950
esteemed colleagues who have been

00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:12,480
surprisingly quiet through this

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,460
told me from nixar who has been helping

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,620
me with the slides as I panicked the

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,900
worst here that was awesome

00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:31,439
so thanks for all the beer and

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:31,439
[Applause]

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:43,829
do we have time for questions

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:45,809
cool anyone do you have any do you have

00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:48,210
any suggestions for making the audit

00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:51,180
process in the compliance part of it

00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:57,000
better and making you know or it's

00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:58,770
better can you refer three people I'm

00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,280
not sure I got it do you have any

00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:05,040
suggestions - on how to make the process

00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,319
of auditing or you know making the

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,630
standards and the auditors more well

00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:14,099
informed on how is oh I see yeah so how

00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:18,809
we can improve the auditing process

00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:21,450
essentially I don't know that's an

00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,770
uphill battle because we're again we're

00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,569
at the bottom of this we were all the

00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:28,319
blame is being shifted we can't really

00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:30,180
do a lot until very recently we haven't

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,010
had anywhere where we could complain if

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,770
we thought our auditor was doing a

00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:37,290
job or was plain old wrong we could not

00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,030
complain to anyone it's like if you have

00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:44,910
a problem then just find a different

00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:47,700
table so honestly I don't know it's very

00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,500
set of problems relating to FreeBSD

00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,710
which came up repeatedly doing the

00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:56,910
audits something like if we ve had this

00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:59,190
work around or if we could teach the

00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:05,210
auditors about this would simplify your

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:07,619
life how freebsd has been if at all

00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:14,099
repeated sort of challenge viewing the

00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:16,890
audits it's not a linux that that's that

00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:18,930
keeps coming up this is a Linux right

00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,520
well yeah so jails what what's it

00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:25,650
actually called is it it's like VMware

00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:28,309
right no not really the big one that so

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:32,460
this whole password history problem is

00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:34,430
one but we've solved that by saying okay

00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,420
on the application level we have

00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:39,000
different password implementations

00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:43,650
obviously on system level we don't use

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,670
passwords we use you know hardware SSH

00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,000
keys

00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:49,559
so no password policy required but I

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,880
have to admit that sometimes it would

00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,859
have been nice to have a more flexible

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,250
password policy in the PC era where you

00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:57,750
can say that ok nowadays people don't

00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,910
change their passwords every month

00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:02,640
because they use password managers for

00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,829
example or storing the 10 lost passwords

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,440
that's actually a potential liability in

00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:08,789
itself but then you have the other side

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,349
of the fence where these requirements

00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:12,269
come from who say that this is the only

00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:14,460
way to make sure that you actually have

00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:18,240
new passwords every time I'm not sure I

00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:26,130
don't like that thought about just

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:28,200
storing the hash sure but it's if you

00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,579
attack it using a pattern you know you

00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,809
assume people just add a number or

00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:37,559
something that is very easy to verify

00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:42,410
this I came up with very creative ways

00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:42,410
to explain things yeah so we just don't

00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:55,319
password change time yes

00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:58,200
so again Kerberos or LDAP that sort of

00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:59,970
thing could use it we have chosen not to

00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,160
because it's simply more complexity than

00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,900
I think it's worth so we just don't use

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,940
passwords on the system level and when

00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,450
we do have passwords on the system level

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,519
they can only be used physically on site

00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:14,009
under dual control which is removes the

00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,450
whole problem then you just argue the

00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:18,259
password doesn't actually matter because

00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,369
you still need two people and two keys

00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:22,380
when I was at the University of Oslo

00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:24,390
what we did with the password changes

00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,490
was that we stored the hashes for I

00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:30,240
think the last three or five hashes and

00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:32,279
then when the user tried to set a new

00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,599
password we would use the new password

00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:37,190
as the basis for a dictionary attack

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,079
only existing on the old salted yeah

00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:42,029
beautiful and beautiful so we would so

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,500
we would have for instance just adding a

00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:44,880
number or incrementing a number at the

00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,410
end of the password would have been that

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,809
would be rejected because the dictionary

00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:51,780
attack would would succeed yes the old

00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:56,910
passwords I see

00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:58,590
again we've had a lot of ugly

00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:00,420
implementations to try and comply

00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:03,000
throughout but removing the whole class

00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,980
of problems by not using passwords has

00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:14,460
turned out for us to be the simplest

00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:16,230
solution anyone what does the standard

00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,240
say and what did you do was respective

00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,710
passwords that services used to

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,870
authenticate to each other do you use

00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,810
SSH keys or TLS or anything to

00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:28,280
authenticate to my sequel and we use so

00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:30,930
I mentioned I use puppet Everywhere

00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,180
puppet has the nice side effect of also

00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,560
being an internal CA so if you're

00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,630
careful about how you use it you can

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,790
actually use that to authenticate all

00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,820
your hosts to each other because every

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:45,470
node in the network has a certificate

00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:51,780
issued under this CA so you do have

00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:53,640
neutral TLS level authentication it

00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,520
depends on your environment whether this

00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,710
is good enough or not but in our case

00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:09,180
that has gone above and beyond what has

00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:10,680
been required more if nothing else then

00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:22,550
thank you very much for your attention

00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:22,550
[Applause]
