Analysing performance issues might be tricky. No matter how powerful
your tools are, you have to point them to the correct spot and be able
to interpret their output.
This talk presents the analysis and fixes for a performance regression
introduced in Firefox 40.0 on OpenBSD. A debug story from X to libpthread
with a detour in the scheduler all of that without DTrace.
