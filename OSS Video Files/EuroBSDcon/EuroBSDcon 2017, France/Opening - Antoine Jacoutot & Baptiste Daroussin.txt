laptop so this one is doing is on a

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,439
FreeBSD laptop I'm very sorry about that

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,310

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:49,950
that actually happened to 4:30 p.m.

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:53,280
Sunday slot we want to thank Rodrigo

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,159

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:07,350
application for Android which very

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:09,630
useful thank you go over there so on the

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,660
fifth floor you have a room then there

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,360
are where you will have some box so both

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,489
for the people who don't know is someone

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,790
step in to talk about the subject we

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:25,800
have some organized both previously

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:29,010
armed data paths open SMTP D both we

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,019
also have some slots we called open both

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,640
meaning that you can just step in

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,160
yourself and decide you would talk about

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,080
that you can also use this room as a

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,750
hacker rooms if you need some time to

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,459

the diversity in the bsd is not a talk

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,310
it's more like a book as well so someone

thank you so I thought when said my name

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,939
is Otto and me and I'm very pleased to

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:59,879
be here today I'm the NOC director for

00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:02,819
French company you may never heard it

00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:06,060
because it's called one prevail such a

00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:08,579
French name we know the reason you

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,790
probably never heard of us of this

00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:13,829
company despite the fact we are one of

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:20,819
the rare billionaire company in France

00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:24,529
is because for a long time 15 years it

00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:29,970
was definitely not a tech company we are

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:33,899
non line we tailor and build our success

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:38,040
on marketing marketing operation and

00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:43,379
some innovation about delivery some kind

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:47,459
like Amazon but things change one year

00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:52,350
ago and we decide to focus a lot more on

00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:55,559
text and which is good the conference

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:58,740
but it's also good for the company

00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:03,569
because for us nowadays marketing is

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:05,819
take and take stands to be marketing and

00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:09,470
secondly as you all know large company

00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:13,800
or no entirely built on open source

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:17,459
project and that's we're doing since we

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:22,949
are in it we move from windows to align

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:27,300
it PSD and this project an initiative

00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:31,170
need to be funded and sponsored to live

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,779
long and stay independent so that's the

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:38,459
precise reason we're here today we

00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:41,600
financed this conference so yes we are

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:44,610
very honored to be here

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,080
we also aware that open-source need

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:51,070
contributors and

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,650
that's exactly why one week ago we adopt

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,340
Phil the new phase of in the company in

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,230
our sauce we decide to release

00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:04,150
internally all our project and to open

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:10,270
it to engage something new for the open

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:12,640
source we really want to spread the

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:17,080
philosophy in the entire company but we

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,300
also know and we were very well that you

00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:25,120
know sauce is good but we strongly

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:27,730
encourage our developers to fix to

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,030
commit fix and new features instead of

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:35,040
just submitting issue we forced them to

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:40,480
be active in the episodes community

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,880
finally being a platinum is a good give

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,520
me the opportunity to thanks to guys we

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:51,790
introduced me to open base day in 2005

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:55,750
it's a manual module work for Battiston

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:58,870
Ghandi Nora based a committer guy from

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:01,420
one critical twice so thank you both of

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:06,900
them and indeed thank you all the
