Title: 'Is it done yet ' The never ending story of pkg tools - Marc Espie
Publication date: 2019-10-15
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2017, France
Description: 
	Description:

Some programs just keep evolving. Each time you think you’re finished
with them, some new ideas come around the corner.
And things keep accreting. The only reason such a program may stop
evolving is because it’s dead, drowned in its own misfeatures.

This talk will look at ways we managed complexity in the past, successes and
failures at keeping enough compatibility for migrations to be less painful.

And also, a roadmap to the future, how we set priorities for what we want
while still keeping the pkg tools in working condition, the current challenge
being to get things faster while still keeping them mostly bug-free.


Speaker biography:

Marc Espie has been an OpenBSD developer for about twenty years, in charge
of the ports and packages infrastructure for over ten years.
When he’s not coding, he’s also a teacher and researcher at Epita’s
Systems and security Lab, trying to teach young pups how to write code that
isn’t complete crap.
