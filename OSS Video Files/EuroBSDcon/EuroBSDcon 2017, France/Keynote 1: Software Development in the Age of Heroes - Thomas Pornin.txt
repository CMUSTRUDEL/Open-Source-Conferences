hello everybody so I was invited so

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,320
whatever happened he is therefore they

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,570
told me that I should speak about

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,820
whatever I want to speak about so I said

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,970
that always a good thing which is Greek

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,410
mythology and everything I be talking

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,810
about is there a single bad metaphor on

00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,420
software development and computer but at

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,670
times to see that the discourse will

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:39,239
gradually the edge of eros is something

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,489
from an old concept which won't be

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,489
blocked by this in particular these two

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,530
guards on the left is is yadda and you

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,230
have no idea what's his job looked like

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,410
so this is probably not in fact the head

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,430
of his god and under white is Plateau

00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:03,780
and that one should be his rule likeness

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:08,570
he will do as you see her and in the

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:12,990
Greek notion of the cosmos the world

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,420
curse of Tyler is a deep addition into

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:20,659
the human present which is the worst

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:24,390
time ever and to reduce edges some

00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:26,340
kilometers so the coordinate world the

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,520
good is the place where you had to be

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,740
there was no dope no work nobody had to

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,829
work what we suffer and the first

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,770
mortals would eventually die by very

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,590
smoothly and they could find everything

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:45,990
every food dignity then the silver a

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,759
little bit worse because then that work

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,369
agriculture because they will still

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,700
passing of seasons and good things but

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,219
there was no war then comes the western

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,619
edge or edge of bones which is dominated

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,760
by barons and war and they eventually

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,520
killed each other

00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,930
then the edge of evil in the edge is

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,070
where all the classic mist is about

00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,040
including the one I will be talking

00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:20,150
about take place so there are normal

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:22,040
people but also evils which the positive

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,370
way of talking about people that's not

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,720
the modern meaning of the name group I

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:32,860
come to that and absolute edge comes now

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,250
which is called a one age which is

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,010
described by platen edge where there is

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,350
no decency and no more honesty

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:49,580
everybody does control so that equates

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:51,290
now instead the definition is from the

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,390
Oxford English Dictionary switch

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,500
supposed to be a good dictionary and the

00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,470
support beams it was written noon evil

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:06,020
but in that case I'm looking the one

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:09,560
before we see the oppressor who a bit

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,560
about the demons in the Greek sense it's

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,780
a question of juice only Archie with the

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,380
guards on top and the scales at the

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,350
bottom it's all about getting a bit

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,239
higher or lower on that scale and only

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,870
who is someone who does things so

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:31,280
extraordinary that he is a bit above the

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:34,730
normal humans and not quite but close to

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,000
it and that's not necessarily good

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:41,239
person now when you say that somebody

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,910
there we go it's meant as a compliment

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:51,250
three thousand years ago was not that

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:55,070
clear here is one who which is akiza

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:57,530
so not clingy Great King on the gas but

00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:02,420
it also Dingell God which is even better

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,320
from his mother and he strong wire is

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,479
known to be invisible and

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,479
[Music]

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,310
[Music]

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,319
[Music]

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,660
[Music]

00:05:07,890 --> 00:06:47,440
and at the end of the move deciding to

00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:50,099
delegate ms and kind of moto with a

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:55,659
judge and the Motorola the left is Paris

00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:59,800
at that time but he does not know it yet

00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:04,419
but he's he's been somehow exact because

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,380
it had been predicted oh well ability

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:11,590
that he would call the full of the city

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:14,800
ultimately true we would examine one

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,500
we'll just keeping his head he was

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,870
demand by Hermes to be the judge of

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:25,690
course the trick of this is try to bribe

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:27,340
Ava and I think tells him that he did

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,150
show this her she will give him a

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:34,599
mastery of Kamala we'd never do the war

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:37,120
he working properly the explicit

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:42,940
political power to making the biggest

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:46,360
king of the world and ask who dies in

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:49,120
she's a goddess of blood say that she it

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,770
should hit her you will get the log of

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,110
the most beautiful woman on earth

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,110
so of course Paris Lou teenagers which

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,240
which is a good ice and the most

00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,710
beautiful woman on earth is very well

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,979
known chill Ln

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,590
with the Queen of Sparta and technically

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:11,460
also demigoddess because she is daughter

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:17,039
of juice which is the big monuments so

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:21,580
after number of things that happen later

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:24,190
belongs to me Paris is recognized that

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,080
the Prince of Troy urn is sent as an

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,169
embassy to spotter just to make

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,320
please and of course he meets Ellen and

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:36,529
it leads to that that is Dallas makes

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,950
out with Erin so depending on who is

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:43,570
recording the story it's called either

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:46,279
abduction or equal opps with her or in

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,350
not clear whether she was totally

00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:52,360
willing or unwittingly with that baby

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,250
she's rather happy to go with him and

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,500
also it makes us with the substantial

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:02,600
part of the spot on Twitter we smile

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:04,490
explain six example so of course she the

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,709
Queen of Sparta because she's married to

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,550
the king of Sparta with minerals and

00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:14,470
minerals in absolute great with that so

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:19,760
eager to take his brother again England

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:22,130
this is an actual history karate factor

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,769
which has been recovered from the ruins

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:29,000
of mixing up by the same language Imana

00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,920
subsequently discovered the ruins of God

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,459
and it's called the mascot again I've

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,519
done that no to immunity was made three

00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:39,649
hundred years before the birth of

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,130
anything was missing at the time of the

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,839
World Court oh it's even if I can end on

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:51,550
existed is probably not organ and moon

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:56,360
but England minerals once is white back

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:59,269
and again does not really care about

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,570
minerals like that it cares a lot about

00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:06,079
being the biggest king of all and having

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,720
masking me the complete edge agency and

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:13,519
especially the Commerce inside the

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:16,550
agency and his next competitor is a key

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,329
list is trial so that's a good way text

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:26,240
to organize an expedition great war

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:28,130
against one we agree to that yeah this

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,310
project and this project is to compare

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,440
trial

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:35,040
and with a number of business blows one

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,029
is the official protect which is saved

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,830
do you know what minerals but as I said

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:45,720
again no ones to break the power of Troy

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,720
of course in any one there will be a lot

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,390
of loot and this is what will bring all

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:57,870
the walls to the wall because each of

00:10:51,390 --> 00:11:02,450
them wants to get rolls and which so add

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:07,110
the meat they succeeded in sending out

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:11,820
1,000 ships full of oil in the egad

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:14,100
there is very engli in 24 protesting and

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,220
one of them will become ill only because

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,130
it's the least of all third sheet and

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:24,570
every city with censorship so it's a

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:26,430
it's not to be incorporated the what we

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,480
think is that because for instance

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,600
Athena

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,620
st. apparently not cheap at all because

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,920
it was people that when that specific

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,200
group will be put into text attend was

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,690
at war with police neighbors so that was

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:48,900
some sort of punishment not to include

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:51,270
them but anyway project is to control of

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:56,940
course among all the warriors one of

00:11:51,270 --> 00:12:00,270
them is activist actually de aquel real

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,220
gold and here at the party that's

00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:05,300
actually scary words are not aligned

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,300
with the business goal

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:13,560
first is a tone of a king to eat the

00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,530
creams and is already which it does not

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,470
want purely to get more which it because

00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:22,350
it already has more than he needs more

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:27,750
than can knows what to do with it what's

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:31,950
terrifying is that being of that what is

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,860
very very cordial good wave it doesn't

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,279
really minding killed

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:42,649
what typifies in is the anonymity of

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:46,850
to do these logos the the things that

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:48,829
make seems unique you mind being it does

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:52,610
not want to become a shadow is not

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:55,339
distinguishable from other shadows in

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,610
the other world so what he wants is to

00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:01,699
become in war-torn and somewhere but in

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,850
the really truly mortality implied being

00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:06,949
the complete God not just a demigod it's

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,480
out of it which so it would should make

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:15,829
back which is extraordinarily glorious

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,480
to become immortal in name for that now

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,430
that more than three thousand years

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:26,720
afterward it will still be remembered

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:30,740
and so that's that's why is there not

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,160
promised Wyatt not even for good and is

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:37,279
not there to be present to again and

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,949
does not like every animal including God

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:46,100
in the book not in the movie from the

00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:50,029
movie which is a nice movie but the book

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:53,839
is much better and the book is also

00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:57,170
absent here we both I mean in the movie

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,000
I watch it will get that there's a lot

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,649
of a lot of killing

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,800
but there's not even a single being in

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,899
dunya we are in the book the real

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,220
graphic description of whole internal

00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:12,319
organs are extracted from people and

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,449
ratings of did I mean one point one of

00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:17,839
them takes a spear just under his chin

00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:24,559
and O'Mara explains no stiffness

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:25,910
whether that's atrocious so anyway in

00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:31,639
the book

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:33,679
Agamemnon is also a great evil moment of

00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,490
go away with the called the Alice theta

00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:39,740
in which he is put on to be a very

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:43,250
strong why or almost

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,890
war to acne so of course Agamemnon

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:51,320
really hates Achilles and at least

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:54,170
really hates Agamemnon and thinks the

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,380
project does not go well because at the

00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,200
moment the book starts already there for

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,230
almost ten years and it does not work

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,940
there are fifty thousand Greeks while

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,180
you're out there camping on the beach

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,940
and there are not enough of them to make

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:15,920
you food blockade of the city so the

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:19,280
city has food and just takes on so they

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,740
have really low morale and at the start

00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:26,000
of the book they are the plague because

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,890
they they were bored so they engage in

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,760
some sort of routine in the nearby city

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:37,430
and one of them stood the temple who uh

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:39,800
pollute and they looted and the wind

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,900
dilute the Chrissie's who was the

00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,870
daughter of the right path of Apollo and

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:49,480
then they have a plague and the god of

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:55,820
Peggy's up a loop and they had to ask to

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:58,730
local bank to explain them that when you

00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:06,650
evade the titleist of the god of tag you

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:10,730
may get a plate so the simple Krissy's

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:14,990
was taken I'd apply it by Agamemnon the

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,210
divine whilst I'm calculating say that's

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:22,300
you had to give it back and of course

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:25,400
Agamemnon were not very keen of that but

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,480
his answer was forced by these Nobles

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,910
including by a cleaver again the

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,010
creation of his own authority to remind

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:38,060
everybody that he will do is king

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:41,870
the place decided to give back quizzes

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,880
but we place it in place her she's not

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,310
an object the critical thickness is not

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,980
conduct and to be preserved without

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:53,530
cuisine who was diseased and we will

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:57,020
award to Achilles so of course a chemist

00:16:53,530 --> 00:17:01,300
of his own price just because I gave him

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:03,740
known wants to show that is problem and

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,850
other consequence I clearly see this

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:10,460
work that is the key is to fight and

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:13,630
when Achilles does not strides

00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:16,760
things go really one project wings

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:22,430
because then the trillions becomes

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:24,190
finger some girls and the weeks and they

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,950
will the word description out how the

00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:32,150
Greeks are have to fall back to the

00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:36,050
shapes are things are really not going

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,330
back so interval tau a lot of openings

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:42,950
with the girls who intervene with the

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:47,000
total lack of dignity but anyway at that

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,070
time and in fact we think demonstrate

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,140
that halida

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:54,890
the top performer and the business

00:17:51,140 --> 00:18:00,460
really needs him even he himself does

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:00,460
not think as being needed the business

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,560
we work to the next episode which is the

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,640
deaths of catalyst that lewis worked

00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:14,450
kuzey not Achilles and he suffered to

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,000
see the breached bringing push back back

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:21,290
to Troy hands so he decided to go and

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,530
fight and even had Achilles blessing and

00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:27,430
in trying to fight with the name of

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:30,830
Achilles but met actor with the big

00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:34,580
humans on the tree on side and actor was

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:38,960
better than approves and kill him so now

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:41,090
we see back to Crete with a big penalty

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,690
in this skin tone

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:47,450
and of course necklace is very dismayed

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,700
because that would is cuisine companion

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:54,649
and possibly is covered with the Texans

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,960
but bring me on that but the way his is

00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:59,360
very hungry

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,360
when you lose somebody who is close to

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,779
you there is another business more the

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,169
kuvasz model in which people will go

00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:11,029
through each successive stages first

00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:15,080
they don't believe it

00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:16,549
the denial and every we are doing and

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,580
there is the beginning stage without

00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:24,289
trying to trade things with state and

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:27,080
that's where they would say they worked

00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,749
are trying to invoke girls who say I'll

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,619
go in spirit and fall then they become

00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:34,850
really depressed

00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:38,480
and at the end over x if begin to upset

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:41,960
that Dorado the lost and to get better

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,570
now actually to remove so it does not

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,570
call all this model but without that one

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:59,580
so it becomes really angry and when a

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,280
killing hungry the case analyst and more

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,170
and more and onwards of people and at

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:09,900
some time another God has to intervene

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:12,330
because he's doing out so much blood

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,960
that the local River has become just a

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:19,130
river of blood so the god of that river

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,720
is a waiter and begins to fight actually

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:26,730
becoming God you can take on

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,440
we all got just under feet that's a good

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,080
book it's a book

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:38,340
the to the end of me God is just more

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:40,710
and more and more murder and that is one

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:47,670
of the characteristics that made in a

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:50,220
software developer let's see what that

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:52,470
means what that story means for an

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:57,810
appointment software developer and open

00:20:52,470 --> 00:21:00,540
source is an important area and when you

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,660
are trying to write code and you're not

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:08,310
paying for that you you're still doing

00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:13,220
it so there must be some sort of

00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:19,740
motivation that go well it's not money

00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:24,600
but one of them the big big notion which

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,340
is the necessity for order not it's not

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,230
all of Greek mythology can be

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,540
interpreted as a long struggle between

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:36,540
chaos and order and the Olympian gods

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:40,890
with jewels on their head why at that

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:46,980
position by beating the previous dtt

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:52,350
turns more Celtic and the developer who

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:54,390
just wants to run a complete project has

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:59,340
a notion that there shall be good

00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:02,040
and that's put forward and he has a huge

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,030
dole of degrees you which is a capital

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,470
sale in the Greek sense it's when you

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:11,330
see the or the envision the world world

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:14,310
everybody are doing a specific

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,260
emplacement in the real tree you breeze

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:20,330
is when you are training to be higher

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:25,860
than your to place but you need a bit of

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:31,560
ambition but and for the deeper blue

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:33,630
grid is that they can do it somebody in

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,420
front of these computers has his open

00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,740
fist accident over and it takes himself

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,740
I can do that

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:47,310
he's an open school developer so what

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:54,150
really apart from that sense of order

00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:55,830
these are what you will get out of it is

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,820
the same thing as Hercules would get

00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:02,250
going that is showing this code is

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:07,280
demonstrating to the world what you can

00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:09,780
do and how these things are done this

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:16,160
minimums might not apply to everybody

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:20,100
but if that's that kind of motivation

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,770
under alive a good proportion for simple

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:26,940
majority of the motivation of potential

00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:30,690
developers and did are really in the

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:33,720
same vein that Achilles I actually think

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,570
that neither the baseball because

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,470
they're not recorded make one but it

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:43,020
does it feel way and you can do it and

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:48,150
he wants to show to the world our war is

00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:54,150
to be done then there is a big component

00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:57,630
of anger that computer once windowed and

00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:00,940
I cried out whenever that thing tries to

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:06,110
apply update I mean it sir

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:09,230
it's insufferable the one element of

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:15,650
anger comes from the idea that the

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:20,000
existing projects are really bad there's

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:26,240
no for any specific task matter given

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:31,100
operating systems existing offer is one

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,310
bit if something is something is that a

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,890
lot of people appear to be content with

00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:41,840
even concerned with the mediocrity of

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:43,700
the existing over I mean generation of

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,780
users now have been tried to just be

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:50,540
bought and to be happy with that if you

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:58,330
think about it that's not a good thing

00:24:50,540 --> 00:25:01,250
it should not happen anger can the world

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:08,270
the unbe to picked up and to provide

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:11,870
everything and then we see how the good

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:14,960
developer the efficient developer would

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:17,540
look like a claim that is once he got

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,120
with the Unger stage when he wants

00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,160
things to be done he will see them

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:26,240
through he won't stop at the end you

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:30,710
want deeply depressed and finally accept

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,570
he will go to the end of the project if

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,960
you look at the bsd operating systems

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:39,740
they've been home for thirty years about

00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,800
and he still ongoing so that means

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,890
perseverance and it's an internal

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,620
quality of a developer and especially

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,320
someone with self-motivated would just

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:54,290
thought that for his own glory is to

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,500
perceiver otherwise nobody will remember

00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:01,340
his name

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:06,230
so a good developer in that sense must

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:08,900
be asked to walk and complete than a

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:12,170
greek evoke it must go to the end of

00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,940
things and should never compromise on

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,900
things

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,880
and go to the end of every idea so in

00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,070
order to illustrate that we take a

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:28,180
perfect example of a river that is

00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:30,270
myself this is probably the reason why

00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:35,620
I'm here right now because the

00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:39,880
apparently got me invited my own anger

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:42,610
was about open SSL open SSL is a library

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:47,620
which is when known is the main open

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:50,260
source SSL providing library and include

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,690
everywhere including mr. BSD systems and

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:57,160
it's known to have had a very long

00:26:52,690 --> 00:27:02,590
development history from for over 20

00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:06,640
years and they never delete anything so

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:11,410
it's acquitting successive layers of

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:18,580
things it's a mess and it's been known I

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:20,260
mean it does not have really I won't say

00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,970
that it does not have good engineering

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,660
practice because it does not have and

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:27,580
Janene practices at all

00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,260
they are so quote in words in which they

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,940
say that the first rule of development

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:36,580
in open SSL is you don't talk about

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:40,120
development in open session so since

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,750
it's a it's a mess and yet everybody

00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,080
uses it so you see the element in which

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:52,960
people are a bit complacent miss

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:56,470
mediocrity I told myself there shall be

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,120
good code and I can do it and I will

00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,930
show to the world how these things are

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:06,010
done so I decided to write a new library

00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:09,610
and to be to make something which can be

00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:13,020
shown initially I wanted something such

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:17,170
as the source code could be serve as a

00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:21,130
tool for explaining or to develop the

00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:23,690
pedagogical thing also I wanted to be

00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:27,260
extraordinarily light inversing worm

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:29,630
usage and code size and it had to be of

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,310
high quality especially the

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:34,250
cryptographic implementation there is

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:36,650
something called concern time code which

00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,290
means that God that is inherently

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,180
resilient to side channel attacks and I

00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:46,100
wanted to add that everywhere

00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:48,950
and the last item on the slider is an

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:52,460
important one because what it says is

00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:57,530
that I've decided to do that in early

00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:00,440
2015 but the first time I told other

00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:02,570
people that the project existed was when

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,460
I produce the factory big version and

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:09,950
that was almost two years after so I

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:13,190
consumer I mean I wanted it to be done

00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:17,720
and I kept it for almost two years

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:25,100
without external motivation just to show

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:29,030
it so as an example of how these

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:31,370
principles of those knives apply to

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:35,120
technical things I will go into the

00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:37,580
technical side of things in a specific

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:41,300
theme which is how you decode an estate

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:44,230
structure there are a lot of structure

00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,570
more or less complicated in TLS

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:51,380
including the uncheck messages and x.509

00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:53,120
certificates and by nested I mean that

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,130
each structure contains sub structure

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,000
which contain sub sub sub shells and so

00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:02,480
on and one of my goals was to save wanna

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,390
so I don't buffer things every

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,870
processing should be streamed in a fixed

00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:12,050
amount of gamma so the usual solution to

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:16,160
handle the decoding of complex structure

00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:18,260
is to buffer the complete message which

00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,800
is one and then you have some code which

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:23,810
explored iteratively and every time it

00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,530
enters a sub structure you just open

00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:32,300
another only another function or another

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:35,150
block of code which was this one and I

00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:37,970
did not have in my goals the one to do

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,980
that so another solution

00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,030
which is applicable in some languages is

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,070
to have Co butenes

00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:47,960
in which you can have one processing

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:50,540
which is recursive with function cooling

00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,720
shape functions and so on and that

00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:58,040
consumes input bars and output the

00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:00,410
decoded elements and to be able to

00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:04,390
operate in a stream station it has to

00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:07,520
run in his own sort of thread and just

00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:10,340
there are no computing since standard C

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,560
you can hack something along with long

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:16,610
jump and so on but it just it so abort

00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:20,210
its fazil it was extra one and you

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:22,460
should really not do that so here is an

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:25,960
example of one message that should be

00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:29,180
decoded itself current hello Angeles

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,250
what you can see here is that the

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,040
message itself is a structure with a

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:38,240
number of field which have subfields and

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:40,990
some of them the values which I negated

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:45,200
are length so for instance you can have

00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:48,080
an open-ended sequence of extensions up

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:52,100
to 64 kilobytes in length so if you want

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,250
to buffer everything you have to accept

00:31:52,100 --> 00:32:02,000
the idea that qu of message may take up

00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:04,460
to 64 kilobytes or even more so my first

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,500
step was that I wrote as a prototype a

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,010
generic decoder for that using a

00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,320
template that is I had structure in

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,810
memory in with only memories that

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,270
describe the structure of a message and

00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:22,610
then some code which was looking like an

00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:24,110
XML sax parser just to to read the term

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,780
title sequence of decoding instruction

00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:30,110
and to be restartable whenever it has

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:34,910
new data bytes and to producing like a

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:37,580
small custom code booting it worked it

00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:41,540
was not very satisfying but it somehow

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:45,080
worked but then and this is my point

00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:48,500
here is that I wanted to be to go to the

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,029
end of that idea and I recognized as a

00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:54,200
generic decoder

00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:58,090
was really smooth implementation for a

00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:02,889
new lung programming language and so

00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:05,299
channeling my inner Evo I decided to

00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:06,919
create a new programming language and

00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:09,440
watch the compiler and just be done with

00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:14,389
it and I did

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,460
so decided that this decoding language

00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:18,679
should really be its own programming and

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,759
so I what a compiler which is in c-sharp

00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:25,309
and using a force like syntax because

00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:28,370
force is relatively easy to do talk to

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:33,409
that in sixth and Sybil it allows meta

00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:36,320
programming and that compiler produces a

00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:38,629
cool routine in fact it produces some

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,320
smooth interpreter in C which is

00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:42,049
researchable

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,710
and has its own stack and it's very

00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:50,480
light in one because the stack is bonded

00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:55,820
it contains 17 words of 32 bits so I'm

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:58,159
just reading 68 bytes of one which is

00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:02,210
relatively small so the code looks like

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,149
that so it's he if you have tried to

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,879
play with the boot loader for FreeBSD

00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:10,369
you already saw false code because there

00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:14,659
is a first interpreter in it so it looks

00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:20,240
like that and it's a bit barbary on the

00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:22,639
onion but it's easy to pass because each

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,190
basically each word becomes one

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,030
instruction and in the output becomes

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:33,679
one byte of code so this process is a

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:38,240
direct messages in SSL and in total it

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,730
takes about 40 bytes of code 40 bytes of

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,210
form just to do that thing so it allows

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:47,829
to pack a lot of behavior in a very

00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,829
small amount of code size

00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:59,890
that to summarize a bit of what a few

00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:03,250
tips because since I think of myself

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:07,060
every woe and since I already look like

00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:09,130
Brad Pitt I decided that I could give

00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,440
tips I mean it's part of the arrogance

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:16,270
of the reward to think that you can

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:19,750
teach others here are my tips which is

00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:22,140
for an earring developer is to consider

00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:25,090
that every lines of code that divides

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,280
engages is one oh that is easy blow we

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:30,340
will be judged by the quality of 40

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,910
white so it's a really a matter of

00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,880
maintaining your own standards you have

00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,300
to be patient and when you decide

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,090
something you have to keep to it and

00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:45,160
even if it takes time so in the guard we

00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:48,610
see that Achilles has decided that he

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:53,230
will not fight for Agamemnon and he will

00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:56,230
effectively stops fighting for about 19

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:59,530
books of the 24 so for 19 books we see

00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,630
Achilles simply booting and a lot of

00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,720
things happen and he is not taking part

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:09,190
because he has decided to do that and he

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,490
keeps to it and when he decides at the

00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:16,270
end to go fight Inga then God is very

00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:20,170
soft he's not doing some smaller

00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:23,580
afternoon fighting no answer it's going

00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:27,430
on a foot one page let's just notice and

00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:30,670
you have to keep learning because you

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:34,180
need to you want to be good at what you

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:36,910
do so you don't stop at some point thing

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:40,000
I know everything now I can just do it

00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:43,930
and just leave on it you want to remain

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,210
Tina so in the wire metaphor you want to

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:49,900
keep training even when you are not

00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:54,070
fighting because you never as good at

00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:55,630
what you will be afterwards and you have

00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:59,340
to know that you must complete your

00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:01,620
project of the wiser you just

00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,980
fall back into the anonymity that

00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:07,590
terrified activism this is when you

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:12,210
complete something when you've formally

00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:15,650
released the code that yo glowy we can

00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:19,140
become something else and just a dream

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,750
now there is an other side of the story

00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:28,110
which is what your manager will think of

00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:30,420
it so this story also has tips for what

00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:35,880
are you going to do with you own evil

00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:39,570
and that Agamemnon's problem because we

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:43,310
have that top performer and his team but

00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:46,920
that top performer is also a diva and he

00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:50,250
must know how to do it and in the regard

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,940
we see how Agamemnon's do manages very

00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:56,040
poorly so what you must do when you have

00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,320
a we warn you team is that you must

00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,690
understand that you can truly manage him

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:05,760
it's just some sort of ferocious beast

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,460
that you can unleash on a problem and

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,560
your job is to feed him with good

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:16,320
challenges with good problems so that it

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:20,430
will keep him occupied and he will do it

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:24,590
stirs up properly but he you have to be

00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:28,950
to provide things that he will sing

00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:31,740
sweet love his own glory you won't work

00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:34,110
if he feels that what you are giving him

00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:38,430
a too easy and could be done by no more

00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:42,030
people he has to be just to be praised

00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:47,280
and to feel that he is weak of knives to

00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:50,970
his own view of things and don't give a

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:56,610
great because they can smell it it has

00:38:50,970 --> 00:39:01,290
to be felt and the last part time sheets

00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:05,059
are a good metaphor of a nice package

00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:08,269
stacks and heroes don't have that at all

00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:11,089
so don't you have to relieve them of

00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:15,229
anything as mundane even if it's

00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:17,779
critical for good business and so on so

00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:20,839
the notion for the manager is that she

00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:26,029
had no no yoru managing will be a lot

00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:29,869
easier but then he lose the wall because

00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:34,729
the top the few top performers are in

00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:37,219
fact necessary and this rate is the

00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:39,559
question of whether this will continue

00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:44,269
in the future so let's talk a bit about

00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:47,959
the high one age this is from the SEM

00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:50,839
and it's from your 2000 so they ask

00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:53,269
themself a question which was on zero at

00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:56,150
that time and it's still unclear which

00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:59,900
is whether software engineers should be

00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:06,859
like other and winners like for which

00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:09,769
building should they be licensed and can

00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:12,380
everybody just tell I can do software

00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:14,900
the tweet or should there be some sort

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:18,289
of regulation because when you have a

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:23,630
bridge to build up you are feel happy to

00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:26,749
have some sort of function by your state

00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,309
agency that says you this guy really

00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:31,729
knows how to be breached

00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:35,659
so it will be Deaton it won't fall down

00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:38,659
and there is a whole lot of regulation

00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:41,059
on that and the question was would that

00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:44,809
apply to software engineering and the

00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:50,390
ACM in 2000 basically said no they did

00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:53,390
not want it because it says that it does

00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:57,229
not work but the the field is too new

00:40:53,390 --> 00:41:00,380
and there's no good definition of what

00:40:57,229 --> 00:41:04,939
would make good and software engineer

00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:07,189
it's not other I mean if you went about

00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:10,159
building the bridge there are some part

00:41:07,189 --> 00:41:13,249
in a bridge or such a pillar and stable

00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,900
and so on so it's known how which should

00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:17,770
be built and there is room

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,710
innovation but at least the autumn

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:26,029
there's some common knowledge and skills

00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:30,410
that can be certified and verified so

00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:34,190
you can have a notion also bilging

00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,750
engineer who is good at that and we will

00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,349
give you some guarantees that the work

00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:42,200
is done properly and not so much in

00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:46,099
software at least in 2000 so the SEM

00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:48,069
took his tongue and said no there should

00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:50,809
not be licensing of software engineer

00:41:48,069 --> 00:42:06,460
however that was a question which was in

00:41:50,809 --> 00:42:06,460
the air exactly ok

00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:18,450
Association for Computing Machinery math

00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:23,730
okay so it's one of the big institution

00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:24,720
of software engineers and another one is

00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,319
the OEE

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:33,799
who edict on that and we took basically

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:37,200
the the opposite position so SEM is

00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:40,710
against licensing and ie is a poor

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:45,269
licensing so the debate is ongoing that

00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:49,019
one is from 2004 in which just an

00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:53,369
opinion of some guy but avoids text

00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:54,239
about how again engineering might be

00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:56,249
necessary

00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,109
much like big bitching because it's a

00:42:56,249 --> 00:43:01,130
good metaphor everybody talks about

00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:03,779
building a bridge in some parts of

00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,819
computing we are talking about cars of

00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:11,359
the general metaphor but here it's

00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:13,499
reached and then the other people who

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,380
keeping on it and that one is more

00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:18,809
recent and it's from 2012 and it's from

00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,380
the IDE so it's whether the poor i

00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:27,259
sensing side of things at that time they

00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:30,390
were think that it's coming the edge of

00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:33,359
the end of the edge of evolve it means

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:36,420
that no more personally weighing for you

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,999
one GUI people have to be professional

00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:43,380
and to be registered professionals so

00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:46,849
it's the a1 edge that is domain but it's

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:49,529
not exactly happening right now and

00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:52,430
other examples that one is from wire

00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:55,289
this photo from 2012

00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:58,829
this is that I thought that regression

00:43:55,289 --> 00:44:03,930
is looming and they really think of it

00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:06,390
as curry and then another that one is

00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:09,779
from communication of the ACM and the

00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:12,150
guy would call a plant apparently is

00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:14,839
some sort of machinery because it also

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,839
part of ie

00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:23,280
different the viewpoint of necessarily

00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:26,400
like something within the museum what

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,570
these extracts mean is that for the last

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:34,770
15 to 20 years there have been ongoing

00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:36,870
discussion of finally coming to the I

00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:41,580
one edge of software engineering and

00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:45,210
making that mundane regulated profession

00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:49,260
like physicians and it's not really

00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:52,280
happening in fact I mean is any of you a

00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:56,790
registered licensed software engineer

00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:59,520
not really because it's very hard to

00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:03,180
define what should be the core skills

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,300
for software developers it's not only

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,450
it's a new it's a new field but it's

00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:13,590
also changing very fast now all sorts of

00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:16,830
new technologies that come and go it's

00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:19,440
very good so you can have somebody was

00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:22,530
very good at some specific part of

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,660
software engineering but almost nobody

00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:28,500
is good at everything in software

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:30,600
engineering this one you should have

00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,950
known it is part of the BSD license and

00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:37,170
it explains the current position of

00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:40,020
software developer and open source of

00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:45,240
the developer is an artist if overthink

00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:46,830
without any guarantee of anything I mean

00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,600
it's not even granted that the code

00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:55,020
actually exists and they denied any

00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,240
notion of responsibility if you have a

00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,090
bridge and it falls Donna you can be

00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,850
sure that we were designed that bridge

00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:06,090
we get in trouble if you make some

00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:09,450
software and there's some security words

00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:13,730
which are all want somewhere to spread

00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:18,180
and causes losses in billions of dollars

00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:22,110
nobody's fault and this is even thing

00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:27,210
seen in the choice of the legal

00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:33,150
framework for decided who gets the glory

00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:36,630
solos and copyrights God the same Lord

00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:39,030
that's for paintings it's all about an

00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,210
artistic production so it's not really

00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:48,150
engineering at least legally speaking

00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:51,290
we're just all artists so my conclusion

00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:53,640
is that the reason and ongoing push for

00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:56,520
regulating sofra developments and it

00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,790
just does not happen because it does not

00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,700
work you cannot really regulate software

00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:05,610
and still get the goodies that software

00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:08,430
provides you will see some regulations

00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:11,900
in some specific areas for instance when

00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:15,090
you are doing autonomous cars then

00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:19,200
necessarily there are sets of regulation

00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:21,210
of what uncus which would apply but they

00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:28,380
don't really back late to the software

00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:31,260
layer and because as inseparable as an

00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:34,370
arrogant euro can be you still need him

00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,370
to win the war

00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:52,450
[Applause]

00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,450
any questions

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:13,850
regarding your stirry and regulation who

00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:16,310
saw recently that one of the software

00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:21,410
engineer at Volkswagen that helped

00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:25,940
create a software that cheated diesel

00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:30,590
emission tests has been condemned by I

00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:32,210
quote so this there is some regulation

00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,950
coming in saying that okay you can't

00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:38,150
just do anything you piss on you are

00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:46,340
somehow responsible for what you do does

00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:47,890
this fit in your story of destiny that's

00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,170
a difference to be made between

00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:55,100
incompetence and good food melis that

00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:59,210
mean is not if you make if you write bad

00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:02,930
code and it just breaks you you won't

00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:06,560
get much trouble but if you are doing

00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:09,680
something which is food you lanta and

00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:12,350
you know it that's how you can get some

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,380
responsibility and it's not a regulation

00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:17,900
of the industry because the notion is

00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,790
not that he was not entitled to do some

00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:23,150
software engineering is that that it

00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:25,070
deliberately cheated and the legal

00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:29,060
system makes a good difference between

00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:33,740
cheating and merely being bad at what

00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:37,160
you do so in that sense I don't think

00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:39,170
that it will really contribute to that

00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,320
notion of speculation because regulation

00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:43,880
would not have really prevented that I

00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,270
mean if you've got a cheater you can

00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:49,070
have a regulated cheater

00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:53,510
it would have his license and it would

00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:55,780
not still it won't still not prove

00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,780
anything

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,880
I just wanted to point out that the

00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,830
engineering question was a manager he

00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,780
was not a developer he was one of the

00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:11,080
top executives involved looks like an in

00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:20,770
the USA and he was sentenced for his

00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:22,810
role as a although this raising the

00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:25,150
question of what exactly is an amateur

00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:27,360
in software I mean if they have no no

00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:30,780
definition or the who is a professional

00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:35,740
then we are all amateurs all

00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:38,620
professionals but yes thank you yeah

00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:41,950
thank you very nice I just wanted to ask

00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,900
a couple of related questions first of

00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,630
all of us about the over-engineering

00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,930
which you know here is usually well not

00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:51,700
usually but sometimes too and about you

00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:54,850
know how to manage this those kinds of

00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,740
things because like one people you know

00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,320
some heroes start writing so just to

00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:02,190
write code and that becomes a problem

00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:04,720
and the second thing is that you can't

00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:07,060
you can't go to work without a year

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,270
without heroes but you can win the work

00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:13,780
with heroes only so how to bridge that

00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:19,810
gap between you know the heroes and

00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:31,870
their work and not heroes soldiers who

00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:35,860
need to work with ok first I must tell

00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:37,690
that I I'm not a good manager so I don't

00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:42,790
have all the answers of that and I do

00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:46,890
that anybody really had my view is that

00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:51,250
if you've got your own ego and ego into

00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:55,150
two deep hewing he over engineered

00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:58,930
things and so on then your job would be

00:51:55,150 --> 00:52:04,450
to provide a distraction that is because

00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:07,330
to too long into one path you have to to

00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:09,220
send some way to bring it to another

00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:12,099
into another direction

00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:17,530
that cannot be on a section of authority

00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:20,140
because that does not work but just like

00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:22,990
when you have a cat and he's doing

00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:26,530
something like trying to kill a clown

00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:33,099
that houseplant you bring out a toy just

00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:36,160
to distract his attention and that kind

00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:40,450
of developers with too much in his own

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,550
ideas you can steal it by providing the

00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:45,369
first challenge in another direction and

00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:48,369
if you provide enough challenges he

00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:51,099
won't he won't really work well with

00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:54,160
normal workers because in his view

00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:58,000
they're all pigeons he does not want to

00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:01,839
talk to them but it can be convinced too

00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,589
let's leave them alone and to just let

00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:09,369
the non ballplayers bask in his radiance

00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:13,470
as long as you don't give in China to

00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:16,780
become a wheelie overboard person

00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:18,910
usually the top developers top fo some

00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:23,950
of them are nice human beings but a lot

00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:26,470
of them are best kept alone they put you

00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:28,810
things and you keep them occupied so

00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:31,990
that they don't become Gooding figures

00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:35,380
who will then express their anger on

00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:37,780
their fellow workers you want them to

00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,839
express their anger on problems so give

00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:46,420
them problems and I are normal people to

00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:48,849
clean up things afterwards tomorrow you
