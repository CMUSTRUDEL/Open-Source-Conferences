	Description:

It’s 2017, and some (rare) people are still using OpenBSD as a main
laptop OS, and some of them are still using firefox (no, not everyone
moved to chromium) – let’s have a look at what happened since the
firefox 3.6 days, in terms of firefox features, toolchains struggle,
platform coverage, source patching, relationship with upstream, and what
challenges are ahead of us – spoiler alert: there will be rust. And
system limits. And multiprocess.

Speaker biography:

Landry Breuil has been an OpenBSD developer since 2007, mostly
hacking on ports, desktop environments and browsers – he works as a GIS
sysadmin in an small non-profit in France.
