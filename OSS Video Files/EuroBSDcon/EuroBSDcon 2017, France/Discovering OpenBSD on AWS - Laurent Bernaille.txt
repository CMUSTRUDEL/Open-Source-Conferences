Title: Discovering OpenBSD on AWS - Laurent Bernaille

Description: 
	Description:

I have been using AWS for several years and many projects require deploying core infrastructure services such as administration hosts, DNS, VPN gateways and Service Discovery tools. I used to achieve this using Linux distributions (Debian or Ubuntu in most cases) but always found them complicated to automate and not well adapted for these use cases. OpenBSD has been available on AWS for about a year and I have started using it instead. I had no previous knowledge of OpenBSD but found it a really great experience. In this talk I will present the rational behind this shift and will demo how we can automatically build these services with Terraform. I will show how we can build a dynamic DNS server backed by Consul for its configuration with everything running on OpenBSD.
