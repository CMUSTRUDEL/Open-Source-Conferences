Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2017, France
Description: 
	Description:

OpenBSD includes a variety of tools for building robust web server
solutions. The httpd web server is a lean, fast platform for serving
web pages. Relayd allows you to distribute a site’s load between
multiple servers for redundancy, extra capacity, or both. These two
servers, combined with CARP, PF, and other OpenBSD tools, let you
slice hundreds of thousands of dollars off the cost of deploying
your applications.
This talk will cover:

- setting up web sites
- administering chroots for web apps
- Lua patterns
- OpenBSD’s ACME client
- OCSP stapling
- multi-server clusters
- load balancer clusters
