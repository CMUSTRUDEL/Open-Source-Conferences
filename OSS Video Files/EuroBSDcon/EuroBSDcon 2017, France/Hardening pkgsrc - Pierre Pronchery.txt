Title: Hardening pkgsrc - Pierre Pronchery
Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2017, France
Description: 
	Description:

pkgsrc is a package management system, providing over 17.000 packages
today. Even though it originates from the NetBSD Project, it supports
many other platforms, even as the official source for packages for some
of them.
This talk will illustrate how pkgsrc can be used to attempt to enforce
hardening features on every package at once, and whenever possible also
to detect when these features are effectively enabled or failed to
function. The methodology, current status, and ideas for future work in
this direction will be gathered in the talk.

Speaker biography:

Pierre Pronchery (khorben@) joined the NetBSD Foundation in May 2012,
where he focuses on desktop and mobile integration. An IT-Security
consultant at Defora Networks GbR in Germany, he can also be found
promoting Open Source Hardware or researching on Clean-Slate Internet
and the Internet of Things. The outcome of this work is eventually
gathered within the DeforaOS project, an experimental Operating System
project. For about three years now, he has also been leading the EdgeBSD
Project, as an alternative way to work with and contribute to the NetBSD
Project.
