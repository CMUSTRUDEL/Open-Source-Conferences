Title: Reproducible builds on NetBSD - Christos Zoulas
Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2017, France
Description: 
	Description:

I will talk about my recent work getting reproducible
builds on NetBSD. The talk will be based on information that I
first posted at:
https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/netbsd_fully_reproducible_builds

and it will have more detailed examples of the toolchain, build,
and application changes that every OS needs to make to achieve
reprodicibility.

I will also discuss the meaning of timestamps and other “build-specific”
information that needs to become predictable for fully reproducible
builds, and if it is worth faking in the first place to achieve
identical built artifacts at the media level.

Speaker biography:

I live in New York City and work in the Finance Sector. I spend most
of my free time with my kids. When they let me I try to write and
fix things for NetBSD/file/tcsh/libedit/… and other pieces of code
I’ve worked on over the years.
