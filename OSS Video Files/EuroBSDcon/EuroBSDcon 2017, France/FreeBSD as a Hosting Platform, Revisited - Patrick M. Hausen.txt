Title: FreeBSD as a Hosting Platform, Revisited - Patrick M. Hausen

	Description:

At EuroBSDCon 2010 I presented how we used NanoBSD to facilitate the operation and management of larger quantities of hosting servers.
Seven years later not only has hardware become incredibly more powerful. Customers and software developing colleagues alike expect more agile management, provisioning and deployment of resources to meet their applications’ demands.

I’d like to present how we employ jails and ZFS to manage a large number of “virtual” environments while we kept some of the concepts learned from successful use of NanoBSD as far as software provisioning, updates and general management of production environments are concerned.

Speaker biography:

Patrick M. Hausen, born 1968, developed an interest in “all things Unix” and networking in general in the late 80’s. Having worked on various commercial implementations and looking for an operating system that would be more capable than Minix for actual daily use at home he found out about FreeBSD in 1993. He’s been using, hacking, advocatiing and occasionally cursing FreeBSD ever since.
