	Description:

No, Amazon Web Services is not only Linux territory! Itâ€™s actually quite easy
to run your favorite BSD OS in the Cloud and weâ€™ll show you how in this session.
First, weâ€™ll start with a quick recap on the AWS infrastructure, before
explaining how you can build and launch BSD-based Amazon Machine Images.
Weâ€™ll then start a FreeBSD instance on a rather large server and weâ€™ll build a
ZFS volume based on local disks. Finally, weâ€™ll see how fast we can run a full
â€˜build worldâ€™: place your bets ðŸ˜‰
