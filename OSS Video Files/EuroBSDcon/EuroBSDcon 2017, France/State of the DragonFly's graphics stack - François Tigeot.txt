	Description:

Following my “Porting the drm/kms graphic drivers to DragonFly” talk at
EuroBSDCon 2014, and my “State of the graphics stack in DragonFly” talk
at EuroBSDCon 2015, I plan to give an updated version of the later talk
this year.

About DragonFly

- Unix-like operating system, BSD descendant
- Started from FreeBSD 4.x in 2003
- High-performance, unique approach to MP operation
- Unique features: HAMMER filesystem, swapcache

I have been trying to make DragonFly more useful by benchmarking its
performance, making it able to use some common technologies and porting
various pieces of software.

In particular, I have been working since 2012 on porting drm/kms graphic
drivers to DragonFly. I am also generally involved in various
discussions about graphics in the DragonFly community.

Speaker biography:

- Independent consultant, sysadmin
- X11 and BSD user since the 1990s
- DragonFly developer since 2011
- Has ported drm/i915 and drm/radeon kernel drivers to DragonFly
