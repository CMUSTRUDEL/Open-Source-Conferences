Title: OpenBSD Testing Infrastructure behind bluhm.genua.de - Jan Klemkow
Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2017, France
Description: 
	Description:

I have built an infrastructure for semi-automatic testing of source code
changes. Clean systems can be automatically installed on real hardware
based on the latest published snapshot. The serial console and power
switch of each system can be accessed over the Internet.
My college and OpenBSD developer bluhm@ has used this infrastructure to
run the OpenBSD regression tests. Results for those tests have been
available at http://bluhm.genua.de/regress/results/regress.html for over
a year now.

The test infrastructure is mostly made of old hardware that had
accumulated in our company for years. So it should be quite easy and
inexpensive to replicate a similar infrastructure for your testing
needs.

The talk will explain the infrastructure in detail, include live-demos
that show how easy it can be used and share some ideas on how the system
could be improved further.
