Title: A Tale of six motherboards, three BSDs and coreboot - Piotr Kubaj & Katarzyna Kubaj
Publication date: 2019-10-15
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2017, France
Description: 
	Description:

Coreboot is mainly focused on Linux, but it’s an interesting option for those
who care about using open source software. This talk will focus on our
experiences with using coreboot and *BSD OS-es.
We have 6 motherboards that we’d like to talk about:
- ASUS KGPE-D16,
- ASUS F2A85-M,
- ASRock E350M1,
- Lenovo ThinkPad X200,
- Lenovo ThinkPad X230,
- PC-Engines APU2.

We did tests on FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD and it turns out that some have
great compatibility, while others not so much.

Speaker biography:

Piotr Kubaj is a System Administrator from Gdańsk. He manages GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. His interests include Linux compatibility layer on FreeBSD, LibreSSL support in third-party software and low-level firmware used to initialize computer components like BIOS, UEFI and coreboot. Piotr tries to use open source software from the bottom – like replacing BIOS and UEFI with coreboot. He manages several FreeBSD ports and occasionally sends patches to other open source projects, mainly related to LibreSSL compatibility. He also sent some new ports, e.g. ports for CentOS 7 compatibility layer.

Katarzyna Kubaj is a web developer, graphic designer, SEO specialist and
occassionally a book translator from Gdańsk, Poland. After hours spent with
websites, she turns into electronics enthusiast. She likes to open some hardware and reassemble it completely. She made the Core/Libreboot flashing experiments possible, soldering and pinning what’s neccessary, and keeping Piotr away from mobos.

okay hello you know we wanted to test

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:14,130
six motherboards with the major B as DS

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:18,270
and powerboat because poor boot doesn't

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,840
work well with some boards there are

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:27,930
some problems e and we would like to

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:31,980
talk about them people say that a court

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:35,149
may work only with the Linux systems but

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,210
we are the France of BSD systems so

00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:47,100
that's why we had to check it and this

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:53,430
computer is not ours we we run BSD and

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:56,489
it's Q and stuff about us as I said

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,910
before we are fans of free and open

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:05,729
source software and hardware solution

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:12,530
and we want to integrate it with BSD

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:18,869
systems and ok and when we buy a new

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:25,979
device we check if it if it's gonna work

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:29,490
with a cold boot and that's main

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,310
criteria for us ok

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,869
privately I'm a sysadmin at the data

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,360
center

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:47,509
I usually manage init system some BSD

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:52,579
and I work for the company that provides

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:57,360
IT support for other companies and

00:01:52,579 --> 00:02:03,630
desktop as a service staff and I'm also

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:07,740
a maintainer of some FreeBSD ports ok so

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:12,410
about third boot for those who don't

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,830
know it's a free from completely open

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:18,780
alternative

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:22,890
because of you Fe can work on x86 attend

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:27,990
work on arm does there were so there

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:30,750
were some efforts to port for power for

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:36,380
some other words it can work without any

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,380
blocks for example this extra hundred

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:49,320
it would faster than yours it

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:54,500
initializes memory you can also put mem

00:02:49,320 --> 00:03:00,210
test that you can usually boot with USB

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:06,890
you can put it to the B Ostrom the

00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:06,890
Austria so it's more convenient this way

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:21,209
so open source is not so easy may seem

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:28,370
so there is always something wrong that

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:32,970
can happen and if it can happen so some

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:38,489
disadvantages of code but it's mostly

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:48,450
the temperature issues curve doesn't

00:03:38,489 --> 00:04:02,370
control the fans the thermal issues the

00:03:48,450 --> 00:04:07,170
most hard things we had to manage as I

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:14,459
said before booting system systems that

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:17,549
are not Linux it's not so obvious yes

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,900
usually only denotes well tested

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:27,150
sometimes even Windows but BSD it's

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:30,300
quiet marginal use days for twelve volt

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:35,010
that may be a problem I made with some

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:41,430
developers they didn't even run any PSD

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:46,830
on any board so that's a problem okay

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:50,880
we tested those motherboards I guess

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:55,470
some of them are well known some may not

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,669
be well known we tested this with

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,470
external GPO

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:06,410
because I have a CPU live without any

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:12,770
integrated GPU so that was needed it was

00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:12,770
not always successful and you know why

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:20,790
okay the problems that mainly freebsd

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:25,800
doesn't support controlling fans it's

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:29,190
great issue usually the fans either run

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,310
at 100% or they run out whatever code

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:38,760
boot has in her eyes them sometimes it's

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:41,460
20% for example if you down some some

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:47,520
very high load the computer may shut

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:50,970
down it's a big problem

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,440
OpenBSD on the other the dirt is really

00:05:50,970 --> 00:06:02,850
great it supports actually everything

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:09,270
that BSD is also not bad it's a little

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:12,750
wars then open BSD but also not bad

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:18,720
interestingly there was some jerk war

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:22,860
ten years ago by some student to port

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:27,720
the OpenBSD hardware sense of they moved

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:31,100
to CBS d it was even committed but a day

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:36,539
later it was averted

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:40,110
due to a complaint from PhD so Paul

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:44,110
honey camp didn't like it

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:48,550
and then there was no alternative

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:53,680
alternative five at all there's also an

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:58,690
issue of higher TDP CPUs if more

00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:06,330
temperature temperature you need usually

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:06,330
additional cooling this is the first

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:24,730
it's which was less it's it didn't have

00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:29,260
any problems because the vendor actually

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:32,860
cared about the users robot is installed

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:40,030
out of the bots it actually doesn't have

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:42,760
any proprietary UFE of yours and it just

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,210
works usually there were some problems

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:52,450
on in that bsd because it doesn't

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:58,419
support xh CIE so you can't install from

00:07:52,450 --> 00:08:05,200
usb because it only has USB free but not

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:09,220
vs d8 has new drivers and it works it's

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,460
also nice that PC engines recovery

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,820
bought so you don't have to have a flash

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:22,000
when you make bad old boot ROM and

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:27,250
doesn't boot this computer you can see

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:37,050
here it was the first one we flashed by

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:37,050
hardware and it's it works pretty good

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:52,650
works as the main PC at home where one

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,650
of the desktops was broken

00:08:53,709 --> 00:09:08,860
only issue with that is that we we can't

00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:13,990
suspend and resume so freely and it

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:18,790
works but it's hard to say some hours

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:21,579
after assuming random time it just

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,910
pieces I can suspend and resume just

00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:26,529
fine many times or just one time it

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:32,350
doesn't matter

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:39,579
then when doing some work I can do

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:46,350
anything it just freezes I can't turn it

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:48,959
off with the baton I need to hold it I

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:58,809
need to do it hard

00:09:48,959 --> 00:10:04,149
that's always a problem of course with

00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:10,240
hippies D and this is as doing the hard

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:25,449
way flashing I have to say that using

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:30,509
the big I strongly recommend to make the

00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:34,329
small small pretty one power supply

00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:42,870
through three volts and not using the

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:42,870
Bitcoin from there it was a big end and

00:10:44,429 --> 00:11:00,029
there was some distractions in the

00:10:48,339 --> 00:11:06,800
signal of wires must be really short and

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:12,140
those way too long

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:17,360
we had to shorten then later and is the

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:23,080
lighter from any distraction from from

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:26,510
the outside and the clip is the Pomona

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,830
which is much better than the cheap

00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:41,810
Chinese once even if it's more expensive

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:46,070
so we will show later

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:50,390
how have the cheap Chinese scripts look

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:56,600
and why they are not so good and if you

00:11:50,390 --> 00:12:02,300
want to see us doing the flushing you

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,830
can watch the videos on YouTube the

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:09,250
movies

00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:16,790
Cochise kata is their Channel and it's

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:22,120
it's about reboot and I think that x200

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,120
flashing some funny moments

00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:34,240
and the next boat okay

00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:38,649
this board is quite interesting it can

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:42,490
manage the fun at the CP o with the

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:47,649
salvaged so it actually runs three bsd

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:50,380
quite nice it can't manage the charges

00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:54,310
fans which are also the collectors out

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:59,319
there they usually just end up at one

00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:03,100
hundred percent would be BSD but it

00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:11,709
works and it's not even that loud with

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:14,470
my case FreeBSD also what trade what

00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:18,329
actually out of the boats I don't have

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:24,519
to set up and anything I just install it

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:28,420
that BSD well I can install from the USB

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:35,470
just fine at Watts but when I devote and

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:39,009
I want to put some HDD well it doesn't

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,829
work it notes another payload from the

00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:44,740
CBO's list for example mem test or

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:48,459
anything else the next one on the list

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:51,490
so yes the installation won't looks fine

00:13:48,459 --> 00:14:00,880
but there are some problems with booting

00:13:51,490 --> 00:14:02,620
from HDD I guess this is our server yes

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,370
this was actually the most interesting

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,370
case

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:23,300
as we said before the most problematic

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:29,480
issue is with thermal control on the

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:35,720
board it's a well known fact but mostly

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:40,520
on the Linux systems and we noticed that

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:47,210
on BSD systems it's even more

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:50,450
problematic we when we installed code we

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:59,890
couldn't use the server at all because

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:59,890
it just turn off because of overheating

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:13,640
it's about 10 to 12 minutes and really

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:16,660
hot they were about 90 degrees in

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:22,280
minutes they were about 50 degrees so

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:38,360
that's the difference and we only had

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:44,290
some we didn't have headphones in the

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:50,840
case that was a problem we had to add

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:55,870
funds to the cpos after that the

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:59,990
temperatures lowered they are now ok

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:05,590
about 30 40 degrees

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:11,270
that's nice but I use FreeBSD on it

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:16,060
problem sets fans to 100% and it doesn't

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:21,610
lower so I needed another solution to

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,610
control the fans because

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,110
there are not constant right

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:42,440
another issue is that after I worked out

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,570
the cooling when the server started

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,920
doing anything somewhat it didn't

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:50,269
overheat i but it ran unstable there

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:56,269
were no clearly panics

00:16:50,269 --> 00:17:00,260
but it just rebooted so about 10 20 30

00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:04,850
minutes and it boots when doing some

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:08,630
completion anything when it does nothing

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:11,770
I do that's the problem

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:15,380
MOT Pearson from laptop ported raw wood

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:19,179
to this board suggested turning off C

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:23,660
states in CMOS that actually helped

00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:30,190
trance now stable I can reach enough

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:35,559
time and it was nice I guess it's

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,559
usually be usable for every day using

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:45,800
okay so about the fans there are some

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,250
recent developments by adapter and

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:53,660
Timothy Pearson he putted the open BMC

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:57,650
stock by Facebook they use it to control

00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:03,260
the house and it's now possible to flash

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:08,960
the IBM see trip with open BMC that

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:16,160
makes completely open solution running

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:22,130
system unfortunately open BMC notes on

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:25,480
the background but it works and about

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:32,000
other systems well

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:34,900
OpenBSD Lance nice no problems I didn't

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,280
test it after open BMC

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:46,810
flashy but and control the fans just

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:56,740
just fine let BSD I couldn't test it

00:18:46,810 --> 00:19:04,180
because lack of time I know but those

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:12,330
two were just fine our Korean at first

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:12,330
we tried the cat because cats like to go

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:24,070
high temperature but cat wasn't enough

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:30,010
and radiators even if the copper was

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:35,680
worried enough so we tried to use some

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:41,430
active coming from Dyna Tron and I was

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:48,660
wondering if the aluminium hitters can

00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:57,070
walk as well as copper once they do

00:19:48,660 --> 00:20:00,160
those ri8 and a 13 models this one is

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,280
for one yo and this one is for you

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,680
because there's an HDD back drain just

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,680
above the this view

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:21,900
okay that's that was actually my desktop

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:29,680
out that belt and I I first talked about

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:33,420
on it it's quite a nice board but there

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,420
are some open three bsd problems

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:49,990
okay OpenBSD works fine at no problem at

00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:55,830
all other than the GPU which was from a

00:20:49,990 --> 00:21:01,270
Nvidia so drivers no issue about TBS D

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:03,250
the same problem of cooling when doing

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:07,120
some work some complication I was

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:13,030
playing some game on wine for example it

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:14,520
just shuts down the cpu is very hot well

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:18,550
that's the problem

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:23,370
another issue after booting the system

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:26,920
there are some messages in the console

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:31,270
actually Julian booting after some

00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:36,580
messages about PCI the still in doesn't

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:42,850
update anymore just displays the old

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:46,060
lines but the system was fine I can use

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:49,960
it with a VR serial I can also set at

00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:53,830
11:12 to load automatically or I can

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,440
load it via SSH or sod and it loads it

00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:02,490
once find there's the desktop everything

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:06,340
but you can't get to that TTY it was

00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:10,630
there was a similar issue with Intel

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:13,600
divers at nine point one version and

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,330
later when you couldn't get the tty

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:22,840
after the its 11 started so that's

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:26,560
similar about that bsd well I was taught

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:31,140
by the net bsd developer that novo is

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:38,740
too quiet on stable so i just can show

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:43,720
here when starting at 11 up with the bsd

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:46,510
7 the system just hangs up but the

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,240
console works before starting after

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:53,010
starting in thousand will that be

00:22:49,240 --> 00:23:06,670
eight nouveau is enabled by default so

00:22:53,010 --> 00:23:10,810
just thanks and there's no next thing

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:19,240
but we tried to flash from the hardware

00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:23,140
and this is this Chinese strip clip we

00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:28,110
try to save some money and we didn't vie

00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:34,750
for mana clip we have some problems

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:45,670
because those clips have very narrow

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:49,090
pins so you have to decide and then it's

00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:56,680
not so easy just to clip the gold pins

00:23:49,090 --> 00:24:02,770
it's it's duct tape it's not I had to

00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:10,060
cut them and solder them directly to the

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:11,820
chip to the clip and the clip itself it

00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:18,190
[Music]

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:24,310
it works out very quickly so you need to

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:31,630
buy few because when you try to clip it

00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:41,130
right to the chip may be a problem

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:47,680
because they slip off the soldering

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:57,360
wasn't enough because we couldn't get

00:24:47,680 --> 00:25:03,330
the right image from the chip so then we

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,330
asked some people on the is Channel

00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:11,400
and it's like that so the ball just

00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:20,260
fried and there was smoke and the smell

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:25,450
and so on and then we braked laptop with

00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:29,980
pretty good parameters so as I said

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:33,309
before after some experiences with the

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:39,700
big power supply

00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:43,059
I made the small one with gold pins and

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:46,600
it worked pretty well

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:52,030
but when we tried to get a proper get

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:58,169
from image we couldn't get it and my

00:25:52,030 --> 00:26:04,330
advice will just make a big loop for

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:09,760
fifty or hundred and some guys on the

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:15,700
channel suggested to suggested you see

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:18,610
the Lenovo oil supply inside and it was

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,730
a bad idea so don't just do random guys

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:26,980
because they give you advice and they

00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:31,090
and then they disappear that if you

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:34,470
enable wake-on-lan in the UFE and

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:39,370
connect the PSU without the battery on

00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:41,590
the laptop is actually on even if you

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:48,309
turn it off and you can get the Dom

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:53,679
image but what with our own PSU it

00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:58,890
didn't work with Nova PSU so it's way

00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:03,669
much safer to make your own PC you and

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:06,760
don't trust the guys and if you are

00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:10,000
lucky and your laptop is still under

00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,360
warranty you can sell it back to the

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,080
seller and say them oh I don't know what

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,159
has happened

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,309
[Music]

00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:23,929
it it doesn't boot I don't know why

00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:29,840
please help me and they they replace the

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:34,519
main board and I have a fresh new pink

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:36,620
part but I am afraid to repeat the

00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:59,059
actions because I think they they

00:27:36,620 --> 00:28:04,250
wouldn't believe me twice yes there are

00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:06,980
other completely open solutions mainly

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:11,450
open hardware solutions there are some

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:15,740
novena boards they made some really nice

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:19,880
development boards they're based on arm

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:25,519
so I guess could be ported to Phoebe SD

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:31,010
or other PS DS there's also to this

00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:35,419
omnia a check our buta with 8 gigabyte

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:42,169
flash so actually and the bsd would fit

00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:50,510
in without any swimming and actually

00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:53,779
about x86 there are no open x86 boards

00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:57,070
Intel mates management CPUs with

00:28:53,779 --> 00:29:06,519
management engine and first and and

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:12,019
enforces PSP there's also I bought from

00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:18,710
the guys who ported troubled to the D 16

00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:25,010
boards Talos talk it works with IBM

00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:27,450
power 9 CPOs there - at least 2 GB SD

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:32,000
developers buying this boat

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:36,090
they want to part TBS be on it will make

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:43,200
the powerful station a server actually

00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:48,450
everything you can see this the guys

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:51,120
sell it like now and I guess it's

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:57,870
actually the only open solution right

00:29:51,120 --> 00:30:04,460
now that is modern it's it's actually

00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:11,040
pre-order right now and it works with

00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:17,700
image you can put CBS d on it job just

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:24,630
inhibits from PTSD and and some other

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:28,460
developed but those bolts it's a pretty

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:34,940
good example because it's one of those

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:41,640
free and open devices that not updated

00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:53,190
and can you can show it to other people

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:58,460
and they want old computer for

00:30:53,190 --> 00:31:05,210
scientific purposes and enterprise

00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:05,210
purposes and other stuff that needs

00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:38,240
it's just a big power it's a bit

00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:38,240
powerful obsession so any questions

00:31:51,380 --> 00:32:02,510
I was about to flash my ex to 330 Oh

00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:08,030
merely because of Intel Emmy right

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:10,190
do you know if it solves completely now

00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:16,960
it doesn't solve it and solve it

00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:16,960
partially destined utility a meet winner

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:25,340
it can sleep down Emmy it leaves the

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:30,170
most necessary partitions that are

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:32,750
necessary to boot the other sit down so

00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:38,200
we can slip it from I don't know maybe

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:41,960
five megabytes to actually 100 kilobytes

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:46,340
that's quiet nice I guess

00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:50,690
and some guys libram they make beauties

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:59,780
laptops work on completely reverse

00:32:50,690 --> 00:33:03,740
engineering me okay

00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:09,280
reboot tries to avoid any blobs and

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:14,120
develops meaning even Microsoft updates

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,880
for me that's an issue I prefer to have

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,540
my support updates I need to have Mike

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:25,250
recalled anyway so if I can get it

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:27,290
updated I do it if I started with

00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,390
Philippe it would actually but it's

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:32,180
pretty pointless for me because I don't

00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,640
even have hardware virtualization on my

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,460
laptop and I can have it if I just

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:43,430
update the might adult that's it

00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:50,530
you mean CPU microcode yes on the 16

00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:56,060
server we showed there's an even only

00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:59,210
vulnerability with some CPUs if you

00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,690
don't update the might at all and reboot

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,690
it doesn't

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:14,619
please speak like this just to make sure

00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:18,339
that actually um so what is your opinion

00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:20,830
of you boot in comparison to coreboot

00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:23,169
okay because it's not just an arm there

00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:26,320
is a bunch of Intel engineers working on

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:32,339
on x86 compatibility yeah what is quite

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:36,159
nice but it doesn't work on x86 yes

00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:42,460
there was very price beaglebones they

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:45,159
work with you both it's actually nice so

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,810
in the the most recent version the one

00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,520
released earlier this month there is

00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:55,089
quite a bit of code from Intel for the

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:58,180
i5 and i7 modern modern CPUs as well

00:34:55,089 --> 00:35:01,900
they require special motherboards but it

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:04,119
should support at least the the like the

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,510
the Broadwell and Haswell and all that

00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,040
stuff

00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:12,609
okay you both I guess it may be an

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,670
alternative to cardboard and it may work

00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:19,720
I'm not sure I didn't try it but it's

00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:23,470
still I'm pretty sure it still needs

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:28,359
management engine or PSP if you use it

00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:32,830
on AMD boards so that's an alternative

00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:37,599
to cardboard but it doesn't three it's

00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:41,820
not being any more than carpet just as a

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:45,990
data point I have a purist libram laptop

00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:49,150
with boot and it's working quite well

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:51,310
the only problem is that there is no

00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,070
support for the frequency scaling of

00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:57,190
this view because the CPI tables are

00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:01,270
missing from coreboot to give the

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:04,660
information so I'm trying to push purism

00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:07,359
of people to add this this table back to

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,670
the same well I'm not sure if it's going

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,500
to work they are going to listen to me

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,810
or not because of course under Linux

00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,300
they are using their own Intel page

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:18,660
stage drivers to

00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:21,000
the CPU frequency they don't need tables

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,860
but I don't think anyone on happen BSD

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:34,020
is going to implement this kind of

00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:36,960
reverse the backbone for that is that it

00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:40,920
will stop providing the necessary data

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,970
points for the frequency frequency

00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:48,660
voltage tables for the CPU quite a long

00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:51,900
time ago so Cobb would would have to as

00:36:48,660 --> 00:37:05,490
a reverse-engineer them from the

00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:07,080
existing images so it's quite freaky do

00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:09,660
you know the current state of more

00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,120
modern AMD systems like the Zen

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,960
architecture if there is any issues like

00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:18,150
on Intel with management firmware or so

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,210
yes actually there are issues just like

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:24,740
with management engine there's the

00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:29,790
mentioned PSP blob which is I guess

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:33,240
platform security process all and it

00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:38,610
just well it's another back door just

00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:44,340
like probably a very just like

00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:52,710
management engine actually the last use

00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:59,550
a bit boards from 2013 2012 with this

00:37:52,710 --> 00:38:07,410
Asus kg PE D 16 is quite nice you can

00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:09,560
have 192 gigabytes ram 32 cores so you

00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,560
can

00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,320
so do you have any idea why the power

00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,270
usage is so much or like the heat

00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,350
dissipation is however twice the power

00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:32,110
usage so much higher in FreeBSD

00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:34,960
can you speak louder okay do you have

00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:42,420
any idea why the power usage is so much

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:47,110
higher if you're running FreeBSD and

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:51,160
it's not Phoebe SD other bsds also down

00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:57,990
hotter but they can support functioning

00:38:51,160 --> 00:39:01,780
fans so they can make fans go faster and

00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:05,530
that what that what around the problem

00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,530
I will fee BSD I'm not sure that the

00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:13,350
problem will solved for developers I'm

00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,350
not a TV BSD developer I'm not sure

00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:26,670
if you depend on your operating system

00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:29,160
for for fan control what happens if if

00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,279
you get a kernel panic because at least

00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:36,390
in freebsd if you have a kernel panic

00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:41,460
then then one CPU goes into a spin loop

00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:52,079
and it gets quite hot yes but I didn't

00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:55,500
have panics actually at ran well they

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,400
were but when it works when I don't do

00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:06,809
any crazy stuff it works so there are

00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:09,270
not even bangs right now I had the see

00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:13,099
states problem but it just devoted there

00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,099
were no that there were no panics I

00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:22,500
think the idea of coreboot or Beals

00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:26,160
going into system management mode every

00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,510
once in a while to fix the configure

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,510
defense it's quite reasonable

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,140
for your server board did you have any

00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:47,199
particular difference the picture

00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,449
showing the open chassis did you measure

00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,449
did it did it also crash when you put

00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:54,999
the cover on with the regular cooling

00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:59,890
which did crash previously without your

00:40:54,999 --> 00:41:03,699
modification with a larger cooler can

00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:05,650
you repeat in most cases server vendors

00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:09,219
tell you you have to put the cover on

00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,809
like it has to be most like 10 minutes

00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:13,239
without the cover otherwise it will

00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:17,229
overheat anyway so I would be interested

00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:20,890
in knowing if it didn't crash yes well

00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:26,709
cover I did tests with cover off and

00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:32,679
cover on it was hot anyway so no that's

00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:37,869
not a problem if you can if you want

00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:40,839
some details I was informed that there

00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:43,599
are some problems with Intel network

00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:52,019
drivers and V BSD and that's why it

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:52,019
