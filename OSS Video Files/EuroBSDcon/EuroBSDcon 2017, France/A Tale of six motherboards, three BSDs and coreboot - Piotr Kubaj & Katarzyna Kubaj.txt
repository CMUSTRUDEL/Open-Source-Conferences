Coreboot is mainly focused on Linux, but it’s an interesting option for those
who care about using open source software. This talk will focus on our
experiences with using coreboot and *BSD OS-es.
We have 6 motherboards that we’d like to talk about:
- ASUS KGPE-D16,
- ASUS F2A85-M,
- ASRock E350M1,
- Lenovo ThinkPad X200,
- Lenovo ThinkPad X230,
- PC-Engines APU2.

We did tests on FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD and it turns out that some have
great compatibility, while others not so much.

Speaker biography:

Piotr Kubaj is a System Administrator from Gdańsk. He manages GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. His interests include Linux compatibility layer on FreeBSD, LibreSSL support in third-party software and low-level firmware used to initialize computer components like BIOS, UEFI and coreboot. Piotr tries to use open source software from the bottom – like replacing BIOS and UEFI with coreboot. He manages several FreeBSD ports and occasionally sends patches to other open source projects, mainly related to LibreSSL compatibility. He also sent some new ports, e.g. ports for CentOS 7 compatibility layer.

Katarzyna Kubaj is a web developer, graphic designer, SEO specialist and
occassionally a book translator from Gdańsk, Poland. After hours spent with
websites, she turns into electronics enthusiast. She likes to open some hardware and reassemble it completely. She made the Core/Libreboot flashing experiments possible, soldering and pinning what’s neccessary, and keeping Piotr away from mobos.
