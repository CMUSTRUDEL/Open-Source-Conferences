I was telling clothing with an advice

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,460
for the next organizer so if your

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,740
instructions to give in restaurant in

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,780
rooms whatever use the megaphone

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:23,070
microphone whatever otherwise you end up

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:26,930
like me it's been a lot of fun for us

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,060
and we are now closing this version of

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:33,480
you've got your music on in Paris I was

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:39,120
very happy to do organize that with

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:41,520
Antoine and so you were actually more

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,250
than 3-hundred coming here you wanna

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,090
have the exact numbers in in the

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,950
European foundation token DM those

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,870
number will be lower than the exact

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,329
number because a lot of people showed up

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,980
directly without registering so

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,620
basically we are closer to 340 then to

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,750
300 which makes us the biggest best

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:15,289
event ever I've been known about

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:20,210
[Applause]

which of course prove that PST is dying

00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:26,399
anyway such an event couldn't be

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,679
possible without the sponsors I want

00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,700

00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:31,700
Paris is expensive

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,819
someone else

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:46,870
Michael Lucas I think you wanted to say

00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:50,410
a few words don't rush graft time I I

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,840
just wanted to say last night out the

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:57,340
metro I had a unique Parisian experience

00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,190
and that my wallet was lifted and I'm

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,610
mopped on the phone trying to get credit

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:08,080
cards shut down and I received more

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:11,729
offers of help from random people some

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,620
of whom I knew some of whom I didn't and

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:18,820
if you're in trouble this is a great

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,220
group of people to be surrounded by so I

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,860
just wanted to say thanks to everyone of

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:27,310
you and and really haven't gone to a lot

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:32,440
of conferences if the worst person we

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:36,040
have is Henning where we're really doing

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:46,340
pretty well so thank you all

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:50,610
[Applause]

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:55,400
so I think that you all know graph the

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:58,980
good graphs without deserve to not be

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:05,100
how to say that probably it is ever a

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:07,340
new keeper to keep his sanity so an

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,340
elite

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:36,980
so yes after many many adventures with

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:42,200
Michel Lucas Groff is now on his way to

00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:43,880
Taiwan for BS dtw and Marius svorski has

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,700
agreed to to be the keeper

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,490
so my you want to come get Groff here

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,730
and take good care he comes with not

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,200
only a beret and a backpack full of all

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,750
the conference badges from previously

00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:01,940
and a dog tag in case he gets lost but

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:04,790
there's also a British cravat from his

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,520

backdrop has luggage

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,919
I didn't suppose that graph will have

00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:30,050
more clothes than I do and I don't

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,930
believe I will have the same connection

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:51,910
that Michael Lucas head but I will try

00:07:32,930 --> 00:08:18,280
my best so beside your music leuwen I

00:07:51,910 --> 00:08:22,490

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:27,500
memorize it so I have only two things I

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:30,680
want to mention first is right top

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,740
we are still looking for sponsors and

00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:04,390

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:13,570
[Applause]

00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,970
so another friend that is coming is for

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,639
them where we usually have a BSD dev

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,879
room Fossum is a very important event

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,329
it's very good if the BSD can be royal

00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:39,100
represented outside of the BSD world and

00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:41,819
Rodrigo will spread a little bit of

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,819
worried about it

00:09:49,929 --> 00:10:01,299
however one I will give you because I

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,239
saw on Twitter some people ask what

00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:06,090
exactly do first in their form and what

00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:09,219
we're doing on it

00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,219
[Music]

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,460
something

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:38,509
okay so the first endeavor room is room

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:43,459
we have for a full day is allocated for

00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:46,339
every big project so and BSD has a room

00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,720
for a full day usually sometimes we have

00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:51,470
a choice or half day because we are

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:55,959
missing projects or talks so everyone is

00:10:51,470 --> 00:11:00,709
is allowed to apply after the CFP comes

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:03,920
for the dev room so if you have a one

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:07,420
have one I have a talk discuss about

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,259
something have a question/answer session

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:14,870
or whatever please apply and we will see

00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:23,240
if it's possible to put in the schedule

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:26,540
and I think it's in February for and to

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,290
call for participation welcome in the

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,639
few in the few weeks I think as soon as

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:37,309
the dead room will be validated and

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:41,089
aside from the dead room we have our BSD

00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:46,160
events around we have a dev summit for

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:50,600
FreeBSD and also a boot on the default

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:56,660

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,529
want to apologize about some troubles

00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:04,819
with the application I heard some people

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:07,339

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,910
foundation to support what we are doing

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,589
so the first foundation to talk is the

00:15:52,910 --> 00:16:05,120
FreeBSD foundation please they've come

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:08,320
to talk about it that's probably one the

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,510
only times I'm taller than everyone here

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,820
my name is Deb good Ken and I'm the

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,800
executive director with the FreeBSD

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,910
Foundation and I'm really happy to be

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,050
here this is the first time I've ever

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,570
been in France

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,620
I went just I know we don't have a lot

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,870
of time so I just want to tell you a

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,300
little bit about the FreeBSD foundation

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,839
first we are very happy and proud to be

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,370
a silver sponsor of this conference and

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:35,270
this one the best ways for people learn

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:38,120
and share knowledge on the BSD s and

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:41,810
other technologies - we've been around

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,740
for 17 years supporting the FreeBSD

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:48,500
project we are a us-based

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:53,330
501c3 and that means we're a public non

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:56,120
charity and we're based in Boulder

00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,410
Colorado United States yeah I'm going to

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,200
tell you a little bit about the key

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,330
areas that we support one is software

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,300
development and operating system

00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,550
improvements and we have a staff of two

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,850
full-time software developers on staff

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:14,600
as well as we also keep two interns on

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,610
staff we support the release engineering

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,880
efforts by having a full-time release

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:24,709
engineer on our staff we support events

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:27,800
like this and as well as various FreeBSD

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,800
developer and vendor summits and with

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,200
you a lot of advocacy and training and

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,950
education and we're that's one area that

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,630
we're trying to increase and we do have

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,790
a full-time marketing director who's

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,220
actually now maternity leaves just had

00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,350
twins and so that was exciting but

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,490
you'll also notice that maybe we're not

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,830
promoting things as much well well she's

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,380
we provide legal support for the project

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:56,980
and that's for the core team as well as

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,860
protecting the IP FreeBSD II IP and then

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,830
we support you know face to face

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,570
meetings and conferences and and summits

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,470
and so that includes not only

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:10,779
conferences like this but also working

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,200
with commercial users and helping

00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:17,980
facilitate collaboration with developers

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,830
on the project one thing as far as face

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,140
space opportunities I wanted to mention

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,659
that we do have the Bay Area developer

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,539
or vendor summit that's coming up in the

00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:31,450
San Francisco area we refer to as the

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:34,270
Bay Area and that will be November 2nd

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,809
and 3rd and actually in Los Gatos we're

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,120
sponsoring this and but Netflix is else

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:45,789
is providing the venue and the food and

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:47,710
so we really appreciate that but anyway

00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:50,409
we can't do this without you or 100%

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,299
funded by donations and so and that's

00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:54,880
donations from individuals and

00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:57,730
organizations we do have a new partner

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,649
benefit program and what that means is

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:03,850
that at various levels then we're

00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:08,020
providing some support and opportunities

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,820
with with these partners and so lastly

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,200
what I'd like to do is a couple times a

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,870
year we do you like to recognize people

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,630
who you've contributed to the FreeBSD

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:19,000
project and so I'm going to call up one

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,740
of our European board members who is

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,809
been decreasing who is our vice

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,450
president of our board of directors

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,570
and we're going to recognize some of

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:33,909
that develop the FreeBSD developers and

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:39,279
contributors hello I'm Benedict you

00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:42,279
might have seen me on BSD now a little

00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,710
bit we have a bunch of people to

00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:47,049
recognize and it's always nice it's like

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,549
Christmas actually to give people a

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:52,210
little recognition for the work that

00:19:48,549 --> 00:20:00,240
they're doing and so the first person I

00:19:52,210 --> 00:20:03,669
want to yeah it's so it's important to I

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,440
mean we have conferences and we have all

00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,240
these nice events but there's also a lot

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,220
of people who cannot come to these

00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,590
events and the only thing that they can

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,630
get this you know Twitter feeds and

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,690
other social media things but it's

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,399
really the people afterwards saying oh

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,100
this is a nice picture of you that you

00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:23,380
did there or you had a very good shot

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,299
taken there but it's also question who

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,190
took those pictures and so there are a

00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,350
couple of people who sometimes stay in

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,049
the shadows or walk around during

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,020
lunchtime and taking pictures at at

00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:37,240
least it's BSD can and that Europeans

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,330
icon maybe there will be some pictures

00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,730
at age of mr. Conners same quality the

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,590
future year so what I'm getting at is

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,480
that there's a guy doing this for a

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,690
number of years now and he's providing a

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,399
lot of galleries for people to see and

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,140
reminisce the good times we had at

00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:56,159
conferences so I would like to honor

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,159
Olivier Robert

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,859
[Applause]

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:12,620
and you ever get hit with this one it's

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:14,540
really surprised I I'm doing just doing

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,150
that for fun Anna and I like taking

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:29,930
pictures and to take pictures of people

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:31,240
in some situations and thank you that

00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,800
was the easy part

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:38,330
so next persons are a little bit more

00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,360
technical so many of you are using BST

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,950
natively on your laptops and yeah and a

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,110
couple of years ago we had a lot of

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,050
problems getting graphics to work

00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:50,750
properly and there was always complains

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,850
like this other OS over over there in

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,730
the unique space they have so much

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,380
better graphics and we want to be on par

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,080
with them at least or even overtake them

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,590
somehow and there is one person who

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,910
helped us a lot we had a very good

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,430
interaction with him two years ago at

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,440
the FreeBSD dev summit in Stockholm

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,230
Sweden and he's been busy ever since

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,750
keeping us updated in the graphics stack

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:18,350
and x11 and kms stuff so I would like to

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:21,310

foundations thank you doesn't that

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,740
there's a project foundation to support

00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,730
it and Alistair is going to talk a bit

00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,730

I believe I've only got 22 minutes for

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:30,570
this talks and okay net bsd and packaged

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:35,970
source both fall under the net BSD

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:38,280
Foundation I am here to tell you about

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,190
this Thank You Soros is actually 20

00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,380
years old this year

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:47,309
and I've been a developer for 20 years

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:51,090
old with no BSD IC runs in 23 Pat forums

00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:53,120
quarterly branches for 13 years we

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:56,370
believe that's a good frequency for this

00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,090
as of now the 20 the package source repo

00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:03,929
is frozen in preparation for the 2017 q3

00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:07,710
branch the branch is expected by the end

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:11,520
of the month we've had PTP signature

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:13,380
validation for two years and if some of

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,030
you thought Corbin stopped and hardening

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,679
package source as an excellent

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,050
introduction into the ways that we're

00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:22,380
going forward with some of the security

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:25,740
features that we have Joyent has got

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:29,730
some signs released binary packages for

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:32,280
Linux Mac OS 10 and Lumos I think

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:35,309
there's over 15,000 packages in each of

00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:40,559
those and we've got plans for signing

00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:45,840
CNF packages from the project for I 386

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:48,270
AMD 64 and forearm based things as you

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,290
can see we've got a fancy animation up

00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:55,970
there net bsd release news we have 7.1

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:59,190
release happened in march 11th this year

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:02,100
8.0 is currently in the process of being

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,290
released we started that on June the 6th

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,170
and the current status is it's about to

00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:11,400
be released real soon now okay for some

00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:13,679
value of a real soon thanks very much to

00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,520
Jarrod McNeal for doing all the the work

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:24,679
to to bring sanity to our

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:27,870
ports and there's a huge number of of

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,340
evaluation boards system and chips and

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:36,900
things like that which you can see in

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:38,970
the screen here right here one of the

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,910
things looking forward as well is that

00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:45,720
we have no support for the vac Station

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:49,400
4000 turbo Channel USB and GPIO so

00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,620
that's something that's really coming in

00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:57,390
handy for anybody who's got a spare vac

00:27:52,620 --> 00:28:01,320
station hanging around LLVM and clang or

00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:03,420
entry version 5 maintained by York still

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,800
optional and off by default mainly

00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,320
because of the architectures that are

00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,400
supports it don't really map to the ones

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,570
that we have with DCC 5.3 at the moment

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,900
one of the interesting points about that

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:19,410
is that the LLVM builds and the crank

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,650
builds York does them regularly for

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,390
amd64 for packaged source bulk builds

00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:28,860
and they're particularly good at finding

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:30,809
compiler regressions and that Camille

00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,990
has been doing some excellent work on

00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:37,770
behalf of the the TNF on a contract

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:39,480
basis and his talk was well as well

00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,540
received this afternoon

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:50,309
hope you all caught that I certainly did

00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:53,400
it's not around later on right there's a

00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:56,730
new board of directors I won't tell you

00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:00,240
the people on there you can see for

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:04,260
yourself up there yeah likewise the core

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,760
team we we have I'll go into some some

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,240
detail on the jisub projects there were

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,620
three of them this year one was

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:16,290
enhancing the log base final system that

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:18,240
we have Leo also did an excellent job

00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,140
with the package saw speed debug libs

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,700
and finally we've been porting Anita

00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:29,739
which is our continuous integration test

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:31,869
- EVP arm P max HP Siemens and Amiga and

00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:35,470
it cash did that and he's now become an

00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:43,090
MP St developer because of it I think

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:44,470
that's about all that I want to thrown

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,809
off here soon

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:49,539
thanks very much I apologize that the

00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:51,159
skies aren't available P to see I'll put

00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:54,150
them up online later so everybody can

00:29:51,159 --> 00:30:01,019
see them thank you thank you on history

00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:03,669
[Applause]

00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,919
last but not least the OpenBSD project

00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:09,759
is also having a foundation that helps

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:19,960
its development bingo is coming to take

00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:23,730
about its hello i'm currently used by

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:27,249
all the beers these the OpenBSD

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:31,029
foundation has exactly one exclusive

00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:34,779
goal that is to support development work

00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:38,109
in bsd license code and that is

00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:41,379
primarily done by three means by funding

00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:44,470
hackathons by funding infrastructure

00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:46,840
required for the project such that

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,989
developers can actually focus on

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:53,679
developing software and increasingly

00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:56,769
importantly by funding sabbaticals to

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,869
get larger projects done in a timely

00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:02,669
manner

00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:06,519
now the OpenBSD foundation is

00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:09,879
intentionally not doing any marketing it

00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:12,580
is intentionally not owning any

00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:17,710
intellectual property and it is

00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:22,179
intentionally not directing the policies

00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:26,460
of any bsd project but it is

00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:28,960
facilitating the writing of code and

00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,359
while most of that code is written

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,830
initially in the context of the OpenBSD

00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:40,730
project much of it and is concerned

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:43,880
with fundamental innovations that sooner

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:48,880
or later get reused elsewhere and the

00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:51,650
few programs are maintained that are

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,430
incorporated into the other PhDs and

00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:58,580
even beyond I'm not just thinking about

00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:05,870
OpenSSH but also about libras SL man doc

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:09,430
and many other programs to fund all that

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:12,650
work we need donations in the OpenBSD

00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:15,680
foundations both substantial donations

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:18,230
from larger enterprises and also very

00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:22,880
importantly many smaller ones from

00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:24,950
individuals and small businesses so for

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,350
that reason thank you for considering to

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:31,190
contributing to the OpenBSD foundation

00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:34,310
and of course also thank you to

00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:39,040
everybody who helped to have such a nice

00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,040
conference once again thank you

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,310
the European second organization is

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:52,790
backed by the European second Foundation

00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:55,790
and Henning is going to give us some

00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:57,680
words about it so you're actually giving

00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:04,490
the last words of the conference to the

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:06,520
worst person here yeah I'm okay with

00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,520
that

00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,780
so the conference of course is not

00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,060
possible without you the attendance in

00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,460
the audience so the next two or three

00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,590
minutes are going to be about you the

00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:28,280
largest group this year kills so please

00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:34,910
is from France when I'm standing in the

00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:41,630
way now guess who second venture but

00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:44,510
actually they lost again sorry

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,910
the largest group from the country ever

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:56,000
being sent to any conference every human

00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:59,010
kind of course the US the Netherlands

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,160
the second and

00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:07,950
since every second counts the UK is also

00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:09,869
second to more countries with more than

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,700
ten people here that Switzerland and

00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:14,159
Sweden all the other countries are less

00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:22,369
than ten people but it's 25 more

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:22,369
countries Henning 22 the light thank you

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,389
so the total for the number of attendees

00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,159
this year is 312 there might be a couple

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:35,490
more that we don't have in the system

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,109
yet yeah between 10 and 20 more even bit

00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,899
more but I need to come the bags that

00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:43,440
are left we were about 320 people on the

00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:45,119
boat yesterday right yeah so that is the

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,040
biggest you're obviously whenever it

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:58,260
also is the biggest bsd conference ever

00:34:47,040 --> 00:35:00,480
as far as we know in memory of Paul

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,330
Jenkins who's been the father of our

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:08,190
foundation we have Paul shank of tribal

00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:11,100
grams so every year we we get one person

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,540
who is not able who should be at the

00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:18,720
conference but it's not able to pay that

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:21,119
himself we got him in now this year

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:26,369
unfortunately the winner got his visa

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:28,350
denied so we have nobody here so um but
