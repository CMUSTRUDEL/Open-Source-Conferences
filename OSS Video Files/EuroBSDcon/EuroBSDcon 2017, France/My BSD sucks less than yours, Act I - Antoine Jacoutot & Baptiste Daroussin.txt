Title: My BSD sucks less than yours, Act I - Antoine Jacoutot & Baptiste Daroussin
Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2017, France
Description: 
	Description:

This talk will look at some of the differences between the FreeBSD and OpenBSD operating systems. It is not intended to be solely technical but will also show the different “visions” and design decisions that rule the way things are implemented.

We shall try and hit where it hurts when that makes sense. Obviously, both
speakers have their own personal and subjective preferences and will explain
why. Showing some of the weaknesses may encourage people to contribute in some areas.

This is the Act I of a totally biased talk from two different perspectives.

Speaker biography:

Antoine Jacoutot has been an OpenBSD developer since 2006. He is currently
working as an open source consultant and evangelist at D2SI.
