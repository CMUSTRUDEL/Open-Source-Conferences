Publication date: 2019-10-16

Description: 
	Description:

You’ve been asked to provide a workshop at local event, you agree and start to prepare. Very quickly you run into issues such as things being flat out broken & from there the yak shaving commences, you are immersed in a set of problems which you need to resolve otherwise the workshop will run into difficulties. This talk will cover how many different pot holes are discovered & filled in during the process to hopefully prevent future hazards (at least until the next conflicting change).
