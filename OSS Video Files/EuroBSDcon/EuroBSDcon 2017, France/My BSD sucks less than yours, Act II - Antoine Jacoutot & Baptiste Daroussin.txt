Title: My BSD sucks less than yours, Act II - Antoine Jacoutot & Baptiste Daroussin
Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: EuroBSDcon 2017, France
Description: 
	Description:

This talk will look at some of the differences between the FreeBSD and OpenBSD operating systems. It is not intended to be solely technical but will also show the different “visions” and design decisions that rule the way things are implemented.

We shall try and hit where it hurts when that makes sense. Obviously, both
speakers have their own personal and subjective preferences and will explain
why. Showing some of the weaknesses may encourage people to contribute in some areas.

This is the Act II of a totally biased talk from two different perspectives.

Speaker biography:

Baptiste Daroussin has been a FreeBSD developer since 2010, member of the
FreeBSD core team since 2014, member of the portmgr team.
He is working at Gandi.net.
