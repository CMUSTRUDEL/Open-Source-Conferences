	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,880
good afternoon I'm happy to be here the

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,700
ID today is to share a bit about what we

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,950
do in France against cybercrime so it's

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,960
not really related to your conference

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:21,320
but it's a actually a very technical

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,650
topic on some aspects it's also a

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,510
sociological subject and it's something

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,789
that I suppose you've all been

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,420
confronted with at some point in time

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,719
and you might have a role to play in in

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,780
this area so just a few words about

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,780
about myself I'm a colonel with the the

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,390
anomaly Nationale that's one of the two

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,070
national police forces in France we're

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,280
in charge of everything that's outside

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,379
big cities so that's roughly half the

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,629
population and 95% of the the territory

00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:02,789
and in the anomaly we have a hundred

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:06,119
thousand police officers doing all sorts

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:11,540
of police activities so from criminal

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:14,640
investigations to safety on highways etc

00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,080
my background is technical I entered the

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:24,770
genomic as a an engineer back in 95 and

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:29,150
since 1998 I've been working on the

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:32,490
cybercrime related topics first in

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:38,780
forensic laboratory as a head of our

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:41,810
forensic IT laboratory near Paris and

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,630
then I've been in different positions

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,399
looking at strategy in cybercrime

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:51,479
managing a cybercrime unit at a national

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,060
level most recently and since last May

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,390
I've been appointed as a chief digital

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:01,799
strategy officer it's a new position

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:06,299
that we've opened in our organisation to

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,119
deal with digital transformation and our

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,849
strategy against cyber threats so it's

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,490
it still has a cyber aspect but we also

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:18,630
try to cover

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:21,860
other aspects of innovation related to

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:26,400
digital tools techniques methods

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,740
platforms to announce the work of our

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,860
law enforcement agency and our

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,680
relationship with the the public so it's

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,080
it's actually a very interesting new

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,780
challenge but I'll be focusing on

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,910
cybercrime in my talk the idea is to

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,570
give you a view of how things have

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,850
evolved over the past 20 years

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,540
I'm not going going to cover everything

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:58,050
so it's going to focus on on roughly

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,830
three aspects but if you have questions

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,470
more generally about how we envisage the

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,880
digital transformation of our

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,780
organization feel free to ask those

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,510
questions at the end of the talk if you

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,220
wish so we have roughly 30 minutes and

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,490
then ten minutes for questions and then

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:24,570
you need to rush for your social events

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:27,450
okay so that was about me so just to

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:31,350
give you a broader focus to be sure that

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,590
you understand all the actors in terms

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,630
of law enforcement

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,390
so Interpol that's the police

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,390
cooperation organization at an

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:45,240
international level the main base the

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:48,540
main headquarters for cyber are in

00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,770
Singapore it used to be in Lyon where

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:57,540
Interpol is still set but there's a

00:03:52,770 --> 00:04:01,130
special team that was set up five years

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,010
ago in Singapore it's in the Interpol

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:07,670
international global complex for

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:12,120
innovation and the they have a

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:14,010
cybercrime division there it's people

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,390
from law enforcement but also people

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,440
from the private sector who work

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,950
together now if you look at Europe all

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,930
in Europe the police cooperation

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,180
organization is Europol there's a

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,750
special unit that

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,970
created in 2015 it's called the European

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:37,580
cybercrime centre and it's organized on

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:40,150
three main pillars one is a called

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,419
cyborgs as you can see on the left

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:47,240
against cyberattacks malware etc the

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:49,520
second is called terminal against credit

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,720
card fraud and the third one is called

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,690
twins

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,300
that's against child pornography so

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,530
those are the three main priorities but

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,660
actually they tend to also work on the

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,300
drug trafficking on the internet money

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:10,699
laundering etc all other aspects that

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:14,900
are related to the cyber arena today I

00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:17,240
guess they're around the 80 or 100 staff

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,280
at at Europe all dealing with with

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:25,900
cybercrime and it's since 2000 2015 it's

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:29,150
made us do a lot of progress so it's a

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,260
good a good opportunity that was

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,599
developed there in France so coming back

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,659
to France I told you there are two

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:40,280
national police forces one is called

00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:42,710
police Nationale the National Police the

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,789
second is called the John armory we also

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:49,580
have customs we also have consumer

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:51,470
protection agencies and so on but the

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,229
two main actors are the police and

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,810
there's anomaly and for those anomaly

00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:00,050
our network of specialized investigators

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:04,099
is called cyber Jean or cyber Jean

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:07,990
Amelie and it's 270 specialized

00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:10,849
investigators all over the country and

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,759
3,800 local correspondents so the

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:15,470
specialized investigators they do

00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,500
forensics advanced investigations and

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:21,590
the local correspondence they have a

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,960
much shorter training and they they're

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:27,710
in direct contact with the victims with

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,289
the public dealing with cybercrime

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,490
directly on the field

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:38,750
at the top of that pyramid there's a

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,790
team of roughly 50 people dealing with

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:46,250
cybercrime on the internet so looking

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:48,920
for crime on the Internet or my former

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,690
unit now there are 25 also dealing with

00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,250
IP forensics so that's the people

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,860
working and getting cybercrime in the in

00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,620
there's an anomaly in the police there's

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,700
a similar organization but they're

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,810
organized in a in a different manner but

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,940
there's a specialized in which

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:14,560
investigators against cyber crime as

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:19,669
well okay so now my first focus

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:23,360
credit-card fraud so if we look a bit

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:25,520
back in time so these are not credit

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,510
cards or these are not counterfeit

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,690
credit cards actually it's a

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:37,480
counterfeiting of telephone cards so for

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:41,630
the the younger ones we yo we used yeah

00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,690
we used to phone in phone booths there's

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:49,850
no longer any anyone of them working in

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:54,650
Paris and you needed a special smart

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:57,470
card that contained units 120 units or

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:05,150
50 units and you couldn't make a phone

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:10,370
call from with that the the counterfeit

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:14,419
here used programmable smart cards so at

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:17,120
the bottom on the left its self-made so

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:20,960
there's a programmable comm component a

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,020
programmable chip of from different

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,210
manufacturers and there's a memory you

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,880
write the program in the memory and in

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,810
the in the programmable component and

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:37,180
and then you can fake the functioning of

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:39,830
a telephone card then they moved to

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,190
programmable cards so it's all included

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,740
in one one card that physically is just

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:50,240
like you're a real smart smart card but

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:52,970
you can reprogram it and

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,579
well that's useful for people who want

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:59,649
to make phone calls but it's not a lot

00:08:55,579 --> 00:09:03,439
of money so they moved to banking cards

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:06,559
so we had a series of evolutions in

00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:09,619
credit card fraud and the ID here what

00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,769
you see on the screen is the chip and

00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:17,839
the contacts from a programmable card

00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:22,069
that has been put on top of an a real

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:25,009
banking card but before doing that they

00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:28,220
copied some of the information from the

00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:30,470
real chip on the banking card so that no

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:35,059
longer works but it was an attack that

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:39,410
was possible and they just reproduced

00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:41,899
some of the encryption keys signature

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,369
keys actually that word that were used

00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:45,369
on the on the smart card

00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:53,509
this is a another type of device it's

00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:56,420
more simple the ID so maybe you've

00:09:53,509 --> 00:10:00,290
encountered some it's just to copy the

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:03,259
magnetic stripe from the smart card so

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,600
and and to copy also the pin code you

00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:07,610
can see many of those on on different

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,069
websites describing how they work and

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:14,540
how they store information now transmit

00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:18,079
information and so on the bad guys are

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,610
always developing new techniques and

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,040
actually in this case it's not the bad

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,329
guys developing the techniques it's a

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,329
university in the UK

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,680
and actually it's interesting

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:39,120
so they discovered that it was possible

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,880
to do a man in the man in the middle

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,180
attack on the dialogue between the smart

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,940
card and the smart card reader this is

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,709
no longer possible but they they found a

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,480
flaw in in one of the first

00:10:52,709 --> 00:11:00,339
implementations of of those cards in the

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:04,510
UK and in Europe in general this is the

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:06,820
case we had more recently in 2013 so

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,589
there's the technical aspect is

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,350
interesting but also the organization

00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,779
behind it so the technical aspect you

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:20,019
see from the picture the difference

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:23,470
between the two is that on the left the

00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:27,250
card seems to be inserted of all the way

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,620
inside and on the right it's inserted

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,420
just a bit

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,440
so there's actually half the card that's

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:38,800
almost out of it so on the left it's a

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,190
modified version of a terminal that was

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,470
used to copy the magnetic stripe so to

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,510
copy the full magnetic stripe into the

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:52,470
card to go fully inside and when the

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:56,200
card owner removes the card there's a

00:11:52,470 --> 00:12:00,420
magnetic stripe reader that copies the

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,070
stripe and it's also modified keyboard

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:08,680
actually they plugged into the actual

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:11,260
keyboard of those devices and they were

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,440
able to copy the pin code so normally

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,209
that's not possible actually they they

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,540
managed to go around the see the

00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:24,100
safeties that were set by the developer

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:28,510
of that specific type of point-of-sale

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,880
terminal and they were able to open it

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,709
normally if you open it it becomes a

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,459
brick you cannot use it anymore but they

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:39,730
they found a way around it and they

00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:40,420
modified the actual shape and the

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,970
content

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,399
the of the terminal and then they needed

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,430
to replace the point-of-sale terminal

00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:52,779
inside shops so what they did they sent

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:56,920
people around France around Germany with

00:12:52,779 --> 00:13:00,010
modified devices and they swept the

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,449
devices with the modified ones so inside

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:05,170
the shops the shop owner wouldn't

00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:09,160
wouldn't notice and they were able to

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:12,120
copy cards using that process so in that

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,579
case is just to copy the data from the

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,490
magnetic stripe and the pin code so what

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:21,149
that allows you to do is to ring

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:25,149
withdraw cash from cash machine machines

00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:27,639
that don't use the the pin so that's the

00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:30,160
case in many regions in the world

00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,980
outside of Europe or outside of America

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,870
but it's less and less the case in

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,930
Southeast Asia for instance now there's

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,410
a the check card is used as well so it's

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:46,750
not possible anymore so in this case it

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:50,079
was not people from our usual suspect

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:53,769
areas in Europe that were behind it it

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:58,680
was people from Canada from Quebec who

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,680
were organizing that and it's actually a

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:08,680
motorbike gangs who usually do drug

00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:11,199
trafficking and and they they invested

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,990
in a credit card fraud and they paid for

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:19,240
people to move around the world and and

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:21,160
do that so in one it took us one year

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,810
with the substitute Quebec in Canada

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,579
with Europol and the BK in Germany to

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:32,050
identify the guys and arrest them it was

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:35,319
quite an interesting case so that's the

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:39,160
evolution of credit card fraud and the

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:40,750
last aspect is this one so in France we

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,100
have an organization that's in charge of

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,680
collecting numbers around fraud against

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,829
credit card fraud it's called the

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,000
observatory on the payment card safety

00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:55,850
or security and

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,910
since 2006 we've been collecting

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,150
information from banks so that's

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:06,850
official numbers and I extract some of

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:08,810
the numbers so the actual volume a fraud

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:14,230
hasn't evolved a lot

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:18,680
it's the roughly the same percentage of

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:21,710
the overall transactions so because

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,190
we've had the chip cards for a long time

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,840
in in France and in Europe so there's

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,480
not a lot of fraud but because there are

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:33,230
a lot of transactions it's still a lot

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,590
of cases potentially roughly every year

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:41,690
there could be around 1 million users

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:45,260
that ask their bank to change their

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,270
credit card because of a fraud so the

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,750
numbers on the chart it's the evolution

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:53,330
of the share of fraudulent transactions

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,900
committed on the internet against the

00:15:53,330 --> 00:16:00,920
total number of fraudulent transactions

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:04,250
so in 2006 we have between we had

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:08,470
between 6 and 10 percent of transactions

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:11,780
that were done illegally on the internet

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:17,030
today so those are the numbers from last

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:19,520
year the person tariffs the total fraud

00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:22,850
on credit cards that is done on the

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,220
internet for France is between 60 and 70

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,460
percent depending on if you look at the

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:32,450
the value of the transactions or the

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:39,800
number of fraudulent transactions so

00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:43,940
that's 70 percent of roughly - 2.1 2.2

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:49,600
million cases so the actual evolution is

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:52,760
we've moved from fraud that was mainly

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,980
copying cards and using them to withdraw

00:16:52,760 --> 00:17:00,710
cash and today it's mostly data that is

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,500
stolen from online merchants and then is

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,100
used on the internet so credit card

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,100
fraud is

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:16,820
part of cybercrime today even more than

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:20,690
before the second aspects if you look at

00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:23,000
attacks against computer systems you can

00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:28,940
have the same chart in in all countries

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,440
so it's not it's not that different so

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:37,090
if you look at all the types of illegal

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,970
activities illegal access or malware

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,680
botnets denial of service it's mostly

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,990
international the origin of the attack

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,890
sometimes its local the local attacks

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,510
are mostly around fraudulent access

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:57,740
companies buying on each other even in

00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:00,230
France some malware cases originate from

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,510
France but most of the cases the

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,410
suspects are in other parts of the world

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:09,880
so for us other parts of the world is

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:15,110
the east of Europe North Africa

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:17,600
sometimes South America and depending on

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:20,360
what you what country you are sitting in

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,630
the suspects are very often in a in

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,940
another country and I suppose Russians

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:33,970
are attacked by suspects from other

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:37,250
parts of the world as well the actors

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:41,540
and I'm going to go more in detail about

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:46,040
that it's mostly isolated people with

00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:50,420
some form of organization they work with

00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:52,850
people who who do the coding there are

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,370
some script kiddies but most of what we

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,670
see is a some form of criminal echo

00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:02,120
system with people developing selling

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,790
and using and then in some cases there's

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:10,670
a real organized crime and I'm going to

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:12,260
give one example so CEO fraud is

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,790
something that that has developed a lot

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,520
in France over the past

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:22,630
let's say five to eight years

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,500
the idea is to convince a company that

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:28,600
you're the CEO of the company or an

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:33,400
important member of the organization and

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:37,360
you order your company to send a wire

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:40,330
transfer money by hundreds of thousands

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,250
of euros to an account outside the

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,230
company because you need to do a

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,380
transaction because you have a contract

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,930
negotiation and so on and the the

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:54,160
fraudsters behind that they use

00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:57,010
information from inside the company to

00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:01,270
pretend that they're the CEO to pretend

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,830
that they they're the right owners of

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,230
that money or the rights of owners of

00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,470
the company or that they have the right

00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,900
to do that in some of the cases that

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:15,130
were identified by Simon Simon tech in

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:18,040
this case the companies that were

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:22,380
victims were first attacked by people

00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:27,580
who were supposedly based in Ukraine

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:29,170
so they attacked the local network of

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,750
the the companies to get information

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,390
about their banking accounts there are

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,430
security procedures the names of the

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,290
people working there and so on

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,940
sometimes they manage to get information

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:47,140
to be able to redirect telephone calls

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:49,390
etc etc and in this case the the people

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,060
organizing the fraud were based in

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:56,260
Israel and then the money would go

00:20:52,060 --> 00:21:01,660
through Cyprus Malta Southeast Asia and

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:03,700
so on so this is the the type of cases

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,400
where we see a form of organized crime

00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,970
the organized crime is mostly in this

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,220
case based in his file and they were

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:15,610
using other people from Ukraine that

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:18,070
they hired maybe online or maybe they

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:23,950
met with them I suppose they met with

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:26,680
them and and this is a typical case that

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,510
we have on those cases your fraud

00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,720
there's been hundreds of

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:34,480
tons of euros leaving France and leaving

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,710
other countries and since a couple years

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:42,130
ago let's say three years ago us is

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:46,300
truck as well and other parts of the

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,970
world but what we see most of the time

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,430
it's not organized crime

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,020
it's more of an ecosystem of different

00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:59,050
people with different roles on the

00:21:53,020 --> 00:22:02,200
internet and from developers coders

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:05,250
people who develop malware who find

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,270
vulnerabilities who develop exploits

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:11,380
using those vulnerabilities who develop

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,200
distribution platform so malware

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,660
distribution platforms so they develop

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:22,720
tools and then you have people using

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:25,980
them other actors are managers of

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,710
infrastructure so they're going to rent

00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:32,140
servers inside a bulletproof hosting

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:36,490
organization or inside an actual

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:38,470
organization that does a web hosting so

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,260
they're going to buy servers or rent

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,180
servers and then run them again back to

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,550
the bad guys and they're going to

00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,720
protect their identity from

00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,210
investigations

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,490
there's people developing crime as a

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:56,320
service for instance credit card check

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,530
so you can check if if a number is still

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,350
valid or people managing online mark

00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,900
markets so we're the bad guys meet with

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:10,630
each other chat online it's mostly web

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:14,560
forums they've moved to - tor for

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:18,970
instance on onion servers but it's still

00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:23,410
web based forums and then there's people

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:25,780
who are also useful middlemen to do

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,420
money laundering money mules and people

00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:35,410
who organize that and all those people

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:38,320
work together and to develop a botnet

00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,450
for instance so you you need malware you

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,100
need server to distribute it you need

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,039
the server to

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,620
ordinance your botnet and then you're

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,750
going to need people to resell the

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,630
information you've collected so if

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,190
you've collected passwords

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,960
there's people specialized in laundering

00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,120
of those passwords and so on who are

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,049
going to sell it for them so actually

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,960
there's actors in the cybercrime world

00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:09,120
who have no technical abilities they

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:14,350
just pick from different services and

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,480
what is really important behind that is

00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:20,370
that for us when we start an

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:24,640
investigation the situation can move

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:30,490
from one day to the other so for

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:33,640
instance you have a victim or you have a

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:37,480
series of victims they've downloaded

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:40,929
malware by clicking on a link from a

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,510
specific server and then their passwords

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:48,360
are sent to another server

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:50,860
so a typical botnet set up the next week

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,260
the server who is being used to

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,929
distribute the malware is used to do

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:59,620
something else to send fishing also

00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:02,610
hosts phishing or to do legitimate

00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:05,169
activities and there's no way you can

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:08,350
you can investigate anymore because it's

00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:13,090
been erased the reason is they they tend

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:16,780
to move a lot or they simply want to

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:19,150
change partners because they get cheaper

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,429
costs or because the guys were arrested

00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:26,289
and so on so it's a very moving

00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:28,809
environment so just to illustrate that a

00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:34,480
bit differently so this is a typical

00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:37,030
setup for ransomware distribution you

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,900
receive spam or you visit the website

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:43,330
and you are redirected or your actual

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:46,179
actually your browser is redirected to

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:49,600
an exploit platform or next Boyd case

00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:52,030
and without you having to click anything

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,490
sometimes the computer is downloading

00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,880
malware and then connected to the

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:01,150
command

00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:03,550
controller server after that your

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,580
personal data goes away or your computer

00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:08,800
is used to sin spam or used to do a

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:12,340
denial of service attack in the case of

00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:17,530
ransomware is it's just used to collect

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,870
your payment information in this case in

00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:23,380
many cases once there's one man we're on

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:28,420
the victim computer there's other man

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:31,060
well that is going to be installed so in

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,970
this setup you have different people

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,370
managing the different aspects so people

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:39,400
doing the spam to distribute the links

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:42,940
to victims people developing the

00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,010
malicious JavaScript to redirect the

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,220
victims to the exploit case people

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:51,430
hacking into servers to install the

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:58,030
malicious JavaScript in this case people

00:26:51,430 --> 00:27:01,680
managing actual advertising that is used

00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:04,120
to redirect people as well people

00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,180
selling the exploit kits people who are

00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,100
going to install the exploit kits and so

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,410
on and so on different people doing the

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,840
different aspects sometimes they even

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:16,810
ever met it rather and they work

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:22,570
together and so that's the difficulty of

00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:25,630
the investigations today you've seen

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:28,690
many crypto lockers in the press and

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:31,510
maybe you've been victim or your members

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:36,130
of your families you have been victim in

00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:38,860
some cases like in this French news

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:42,550
article actually the actual stories come

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:46,330
comes from elsewhere the bad guy seems

00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:48,490
to be someone not very motivated in the

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,590
end it looks like his mother told him to

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:55,420
stop doing it because he says I'm very

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:57,520
sorry that I stole your money and I

00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:01,200
blocked your computers you can download

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,130
all your information from this server on

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:09,049
megacode and Z and

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:11,960
I will never do it again okay what this

00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:16,480
shows you is that in this case the guy

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:21,410
behind that just bought a kit to

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:25,160
distribute his ransomware he did not

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:27,260
develop anything he just learned how to

00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,960
do it on the internet and then did it

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,350
and made a number of victims and that

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,840
happens a lot in those cases it's mostly

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:39,260
people from inside countries in Europe

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:49,370
inside France inside Germany etc who are

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:52,940
the the suspect behind that then the the

00:28:49,370 --> 00:29:03,350
last aspect of my talk so who's heard

00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:06,350
about wanna cry yeah okay it's so this

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:09,130
malware distribution is interesting for

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,130
many different reasons

00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:14,900
[Music]

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:19,000
well one reason is that officially

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:23,990
there's a no one knows who's behind it

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,059
actually there's a police investigation

00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,370
going on around the world and there's

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:32,510
been some police operations and there

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:37,580
there are suspects somewhere but that's

00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:40,630
not the important aspect what happened

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:46,520
in this case is the distribution model

00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:49,460
was using a worm like propagation so the

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,900
the malware was moving from one machine

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:59,210
to another directly on the internet

00:29:52,900 --> 00:30:06,370
using a vulnerability that was actually

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:10,789
published after a revelation of some

00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:14,260
tools that were developed by a an agency

00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:14,260
somewhere in America

00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:27,480
and it's okay i I can tell you lots

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:30,720
about why agencies in us in Europe need

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,650
tools and why that's necessary the the

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,170
problem is it was the vulnerability was

00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,700
published in the end and once the

00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:44,460
vulnerability is published it is

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:47,760
exploited okay and it is exploited very

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,980
quickly in this case it was exploited to

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,160
distribute malware such as a

00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:58,800
cryptolocker it could have been used to

00:30:52,160 --> 00:31:00,420
to do spying and so on and it could

00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:05,210
happen to a French agency it could

00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:12,630
happen to German agency and so on so

00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:15,330
let's let's be modest so what happened

00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:19,679
and it's very different from what we are

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:22,650
used to have in the in the past few

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,500
years the malware was going from one

00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:30,679
machine to another and in practice it

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:33,690
looks like they tested it on the

00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:38,070
thursday/friday they started spreading

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:41,670
it and Friday evening it was all over

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:45,929
the planet that usually never happens

00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:49,350
okay and those are the infections that

00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:51,750
were measured during the weekend so

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:55,260
Thursday some tests there are some

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:58,290
traces of the tests Friday the actual

00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,540
launches of the spreading and then it

00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:05,970
moved from one point in the world to the

00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:08,460
whole world and you see victims in

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:12,809
Russia potentially China Ukraine France

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:16,580
Canada us and so on so France was a

00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:21,480
actually a big victim the victims we had

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:24,059
were people having a machine directly

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,020
connected to the internet and that's not

00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,210
very common

00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:30,240
usually people in France connect to the

00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:33,059
internet behind what we call an Internet

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,750
box and you're not directly connected to

00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:41,820
the Internet and unless you put your

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:44,070
machine on the DMZ it cannot be attacked

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,799
from the internet directly it's not

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:49,559
proper firewall and so on but it's it's

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,270
some protection in other countries it's

00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:54,270
not always the case people just plug in

00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:56,940
behind the the modem and the ADSL modem

00:32:54,270 --> 00:33:00,299
and that's why they're spreading in

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:03,179
different regions so the cases we had in

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:10,200
France it's people who are using those

00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:14,640
machines to collect surveillance camera

00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,590
information and it's something we see

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,929
more and more often it's devices that

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,669
you plug in somewhere that you can

00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:22,980
figure quickly you actually don't know

00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:25,200
what you're configuring and it works

00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,000
because you can see so you can see

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,299
what's going on on your smartphone hey I

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,370
can see the camera from my home

00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:34,830
everything is safe the problem is your

00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:38,220
network is not safe anymore and that

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:40,470
happens to companies that happens to to

00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,039
private people actually when one of the

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:49,020
victims was a abu-dhabi you know what to

00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:50,370
do Nora is a bakery exactly so a place

00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,220
where you can buy good stuff in the

00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:55,230
morning and so they had the cameras to

00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,330
protect the store and actually they were

00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:00,929
directly connected to the internet so

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,960
though those were Windows machines but

00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:05,460
in other cases there are Linux machines

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,000
with basic busybox

00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:12,300
for instance or different types of setup

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,990
that that that can be used so actually

00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,490
the victims were not a victim of much

00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:20,330
because the information that was

00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:23,550
encrypted was just videos of

00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:25,670
surveillance and in most cases that but

00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:31,580
that was for one a cry

00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:35,380
other attacks were more damageable so

00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:38,750
that's an interesting evolution fast

00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,670
distribution it's not on actual

00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:45,950
computers it's on devices that are used

00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:47,330
to to store web surveillance to that you

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:51,640
just something you just plug in your

00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:55,580
home we've seen also cases in Europe of

00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,920
actual TV sets that are bricked because

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,460
of ransomware so you you know you can

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,550
have a TV set with Android on it with LG

00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:07,130
I don't remember the name of the OS etc

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:10,010
well if it's Android there's Android

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:13,100
malware and it can also attack the TV

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,320
and if you have a 2000 euro TV that just

00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:21,980
shows that sort of screen it's not very

00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:25,010
useful anymore so one message actually

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:29,300
to a community like you is that security

00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:34,520
is really important systems that can be

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:38,810
updated helping people that install

00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,130
systems to secure the their environment

00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:43,730
to secure their systems is really

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:46,760
important if something is easy to set up

00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:51,290
it needs to be easy to update easy to

00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:54,280
secure otherwise it's not it becomes

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:59,830
dangerous okay so that's one of the

00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,830
major messages for today thank you

00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,780
so we have time for a few questions

00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:56,809
so you you know what you have on your

00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:58,670
machine right so what what happens on a

00:36:56,809 --> 00:37:01,400
tour relay is that it's not set up to

00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:06,529
collect any type of information it's

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:10,339
just set up to to be a relay so for law

00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:14,000
enforcement it's not very interesting to

00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:16,760
see the computer there's other

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,819
strategies that can be developed to to

00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,309
be able to to identify suspects on on

00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:25,099
tor networks I'm not going to go into

00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:26,859
detail but you've seen cases in the

00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:29,420
press of people who've been arrested

00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:32,059
their servers they're hidden servers

00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:35,619
have been seized so law enforcement is

00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:38,869
working and is able to in some cases to

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,759
identify the bad guys so the bad guys is

00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:43,549
some of the people who are using your

00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:45,200
relay but they're also using the

00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:50,809
internet we're not going to see the

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,779
whole internet and so on so but so

00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:55,160
that's the technical answer of course

00:37:52,779 --> 00:38:02,180
there's nothing wrong with you running a

00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:05,779
tour relay but it also means that a high

00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:07,609
level of the activity on tour from the

00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:11,539
point of view of countries like France

00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:16,970
is illegal activities in other countries

00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:19,640
where it's not a democracy it's used

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,279
mostly to protect private conversations

00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,750
not to be arrested by the police who are

00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:26,359
actually going against people who

00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,309
express themselves in France what we see

00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:31,970
is that most of the activities on tour

00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:35,750
is around around selling drugs

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:38,900
selling malware etc so you need to be

00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:42,950
aware that part of what is going on on

00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:46,660
tour is not for good reasons but that's

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:49,790
for you as a message not for ya and

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:52,310
maybe in some cases if you can help law

00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:54,050
enforcement if you have information then

00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:56,630
it's up to you maybe you should be able

00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,450
to share it I know it's not on your tour

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:03,340
saucer but maybe you can see other types

00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,340
of information that that can be helpful

00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:37,250
another question over there where should

00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:39,650
I actually in other presentations I have

00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:46,120
more examples but even if you look at

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:48,680
criminals from Russia usually when when

00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:51,770
groups are arrested that come from

00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,740
Eastern Europe or Russia Georgia Ukraine

00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:58,670
and so on it's not more than four or

00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:03,590
five people that are identified some of

00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:06,080
them just know each other on the

00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:09,440
internet and some have met but in many

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,630
cases it's isolated people in some cases

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,750
it's really organized group they even

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:18,320
set up companies to do their illegal

00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,060
activities and yes in that case they're

00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,940
very often hidden in the country where

00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:28,220
it's difficult to get cooperation from

00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:31,580
so it exists but the the the huge volume

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:33,560
of the activity for instance from those

00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,860
countries at the east of Europe it's

00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:40,790
people selling tools for others to use

00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,890
they're not really managing botnets and

00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,250
so on and there are some individual

00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:49,780
groups managing very large

00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:51,490
nets or or larger activities but in many

00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,040
cases they don't really know each other

00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:56,560
so it's not the typical definition of

00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:00,220
organized crime as we would have it in

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,160
the past like the Mafia that we have in

00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:07,150
the in Europe in Italy or in France and

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:09,340
so on with a big structure and a pyramid

00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:12,120
structure with a big bus at the top and

00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:14,980
so on so it's not typical criminal

00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:17,410
organizations and thus it makes it

00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:20,770
difficult for us to investigate because

00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:26,500
we have special tools for criminal

00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:32,590
organisations we can investigate faster

00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:34,780
we have access to tools to like wiretap

00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:37,420
like undercover investigations and so on

00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:41,770
and in some cases it's not available for

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:44,910
us in cybercrime that's the that's the

00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,910
idea yes

00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,810
[Music]

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,339
[Music]

00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:42,500
so there's no actual solution in place

00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:44,180
but the debate is on the table and it's

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,540
the kind of debate we have with the

00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:51,800
European Commission at the moment on how

00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:53,570
we should deal with those so the first

00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,990
answer is no but yes you are talking

00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,990
about it

00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,260
