[Applause]

00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:09,929
so I had a plan but it did not go well I

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,230
ended up way too many sites so I tried

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,690
to just remove a lot so now I am only

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,109
and I only had like many many many sites

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,060
I'll just cover some and stay on some

00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:24,420
I'm kind of sick so I may be rushing out

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,580
at some point what happens I will be

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:34,110
back okay so a machine from the NTID

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,610
projects and altimeter and github I come

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,800
from the city of not friends I've been

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,710
using open BSD for about 20 years and

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,219
I'm independent developer for ten years

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,379
now I've also been using other of other

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,170
BSD systems mostly when I was a student

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,399
and I I kind of like the pilot opieop

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,870
obviously system I still have a kind of

00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,440
special place for open deals in my heart

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,769
so that's why are you everyday I started

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,080
working on smtp d in 2007 as a personal

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,030
project absolutely not involved with

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,780
open viously

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,280
then hanging the right and jelly cannot

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,140
trick me into turning its into the

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,680
opener simply telling me that would be a

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:27,960
nice project which it is but to kind of

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:30,360
longer than expected so I'm currently a

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,400
lead developer for the reading group

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,130
which is a platinum sponsor for the

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,079
event I will not to let the pervert

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,909
icing for the company but I still have

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,150
to stay on them at least twice so that

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,490
they will send me to other weapons we

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,200
are hiring and including in my team so

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,220
it they were looking for job just me

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,670
okay I used to work in the main industry

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,680
doing research and development I kind of

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,590
distanced myself from from this industry

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,560
so I would be able to work on stuff that

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,280
would not be in contradiction with what

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,280
I do at work

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,110
mom today has a openness intervene ask

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,090
them to do instances I wasn't aware I

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,370
was nothing involved in the choice and I

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,590
was not hired to work on this so I just

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,410
had to be learned from my mate which is

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,630
what I asked him well we were actually

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,200
running it on the table what you have a

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:30,540
few open vld install that kind of this

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,849
profile I think the other people in the

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,230
Renaissance clique who are unique which

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:41,130
is somewhere here son in our young we

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,260
also send our digital media just for

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,000
review and we've received a few

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,030
contribution from the community but

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,830
sadly mostly from the Linux engine with

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,010
don't listen then contribution from

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:56,819
other via the system and there are not

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:59,670
so many stable contributors people often

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,860
just sended it then we move away so we

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,790
we have kind of a small true because

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,860
even ourselves would not always have the

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,370
time to me to work full-time on a listen

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,930
to be so what is the same to predict an

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,540
optimism to PD a very fast overview

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,600
first SMTP is a simple supposedly simple

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,609
protocol to exchange messages between

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,579
machines on on the internet but not only

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,590
on the Internet it only takes charge the

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,400
transfer not the rich people of the city

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,799
so just a way to send a message from a

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,299
machine age relation B then the user the

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,470
end user has to reach with the message

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,340
to another mean visually the pop/imap

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,109
message

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,200
it relies hill between on the DNS

00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:50,340
protocol so you can't really have mail

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,130
without DNS and you can see the the SMTP

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,680
network as a kind of graph where each

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,799
mail exchanger is another on the graph

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,109
acting either as a relay receiving a

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,060
message and coordinate to different

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,239
place or as a destination coordinates it

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,180
or they can reject it but that's kind of

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,400
different policy the goal of a mimics

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,380
is distribute methods closer to the

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,500
destination usually what will happen

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,709
that it will see the next point the next

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:24,550
mud as its own destination doesn't miss

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,650
really know what's behind okay so I kind

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,040
of stole this from a rich presentation a

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:33,040
few years ago this kind of shows like

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,380
you have the user fool which sees relay

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,260
as an exchanger which is another relay

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:42,300
the next center etc until it reaches my

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:45,160
own relay there and at each point the

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,300
the relay doesn't know what's behind the

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,300
next heart okay

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:57,250
in addition doors imposes responsibility

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,440
over messages so not to be kind of very

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,140
careful that what you do with messages

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,050
you just can't lose the message that you

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,640
have accepted so in the protocol you you

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,740
will have an unknown later into the

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,930
client that you will have that you have

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,940
it set the message as soon as you are

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,800
sent that are no letters you're not

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,600
allowed to lose the message you have to

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,370
do something about it so if the message

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,650
get lost for some reason you have to at

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:26,440
least annually the original sender that

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:29,230
it was lost it for some reason it's not

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,720
that that has an error has to be the one

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:35,110
that aknowledge is the original sender

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,420
so it doesn't fit all back on all

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,850
produce note it should just glad to pass

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,490
just enough information for the last

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,310
note you know how to notify the initial

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:49,110
send oh that something might want it's

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,580
the best interest of every post message

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,150
to get rid of the message as soon as

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,510
possible

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,340
because for many reasons the first one

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,230
is that you don't want to be the note

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,540
that lost the message due to a disk rush

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,240
or anything so if you get a message you

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,810
can pass it really bad it's your best

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,000
policy but there are also other reasons

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,680
the fact that if you retain messages or

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,550
longer you are to add the hardware to do

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,940
it and it has a cost for at least being

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,370
very certain that account and once in

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,250
that that's national that there's some

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:28,000
protocol the transaction or portable and

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:31,940
exited message is actually or comets so

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,550
to explain this is it kind of tradition

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,550
so we have the first days where we just

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,470
seen height clear then we have a

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,530
transaction that action start at the

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,210
mail from land all the recipients are

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:48,069
part of the same transaction they will

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:52,280
share a common transaction I didn't fire

00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:54,979
there's a message that's been the

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,599
transaction then there's the server and

00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:58,699
already meant that the message was

00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:02,270
acceptable and this assigns the

00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:04,310
transaction ID okay all the recipients

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,409
will chair the same transaction ID which

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,129
is also known that the message ID but

00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:13,490
can be currently differences

00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:15,469
recommendation so a session spans from

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,349
the connection to this connection and

00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:21,349
the transaction spans from the from the

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:26,210
lane prom to end of messages but it also

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:28,370
can be interrupted or you can have it

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,919
interrupted by the server itself for

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,380
whatever reason lack of displacement

00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,389
sync and you can have it inserted by the

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,449
client with some some commands like male

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:41,900
issue a new transaction or are sets with

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:44,270
those releases all the recipient share

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,190
the stand command message identifier and

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,719
that's another I said earlier but they

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,180
will all receive the same copy of the

00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:54,919
message there will not be a duplication

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:57,020
the the data part of the station we

00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:59,259
contain the exact same value for every

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,669
male that has the same transaction ID

00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,110
and you can have multiple transaction

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:08,360
within the same session it just had to

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,569
go through another page so what open is

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,590
SimCity B it's a general-purpose

00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:15,500
implementation of the sense P protocol

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,710
those goals the server side and client

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,979
side part of the protocol in the server

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,180
side protocol server side

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,800
implementation what it does accept

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,610
messages coming from the network or

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,069
little socket and insert it since it's

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:35,539
cute to relay or they'll work and as a

00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:39,590
client to cooperated clients taking a

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:42,950
message from the queue and forwarding it

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:45,650
we draw it has some other duties that

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,500
will seem boats like it doesn't follow

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:51,020
the can be really psycho that's it that

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,480
is what that means is that we don't have

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,280
the release every six months because at

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,490
some point we had the time to do it and

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,880
now we aren't enough changes to to

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,280
justify or Elizabeth since month first

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,190
but when we have a release we just wait

00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,070
for the conveniently released about the

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:15,530
same time and we carried the same

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:17,510
version end of December so summarizing

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,340
the Chilean's that it accepts me search

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,470
from a unique circuit or the network it

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:25,250
does some result of the addresses that

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,320
we see in the transaction it manages or

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,960
little queue of messages that were not

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:36,080
allowed to lose it schedules message for

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:41,570
delivery it has some retry logic okay to

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:43,580
our temporary failure to retry its relay

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,880
messages to other hosts over the network

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,460
our delivers messages locally by will

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,700
teaching about the new agent with the

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,230
user community meant DiLaurentis

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,870
whatever application that can really on

00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:01,490
the standard empath and put the content

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:05,960
somewhere for the you okay we have a

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:09,280
nice community very not IRC and megan

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,860
list we've been packaged to many systems

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:16,339
we honestly don't keep track of this

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,800
mostly because Eric is kind of salt and

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,990
I'm telephone through so we often learn

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,880
that purported to move distribution

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,670
because we have a maintainer joining the

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,460
channel and asking us or help packaging

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:33,320
so that's how we like this works we

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:37,190
destroy no even exist just because H on

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,380
the organisms will communicate something

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,070
that nice it's that people are starting

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,410
to to choose

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,810
to choose to at least try openness and

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,389
speedy whenever they start a new mail

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,130
server and they are experienced

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:54,130
experiencing with the different

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:56,259
solutions that was not the case two

00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:01,029
years ago or two or three years ago I

00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:03,670
kind of still go to forums to see what

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:07,329
what are the main complaints from users

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:09,639
about the project and I kind of see now

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:15,370
people suggesting to try first it's an

00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:19,149
operating speed as this kind of

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,639
recommendation has included investors we

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:26,259
have a benefit of simplicity whenever

00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:28,990
the user experimenting with the MTA has

00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:30,490
a very simple use case and we perfectly

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,860
fit the use case they tend to choose

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,430
essentially gel because configuration

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:39,850
file is so isn't that people are lazy

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,160
that's very part and sometimes we like

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,410
to picture when people go back to

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,389
another MTA but that's okay for us

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,519
because we're sure it hurts who have

00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,470
people coming to represent speedy

00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,899
because they are satisfied with what

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,930
they get then trying to get a new one

00:11:52,899 --> 00:12:00,579
didn't trust and have them just from

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:03,370
past with teacher effect so you know

00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:07,000
while the last boat was made by

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:09,370
everything in 2013 at era be ethical

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,579
this is when we announced our first

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:17,709
production release and we did not have

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:20,199
any official talks is then we had the

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:22,949
sponsorship and worked on a condition to

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:28,600
be full-time back them which was Kenneth

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:30,610
comfortable just dive into anything as

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,339
complex as it was knowing that we would

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,500
have the time to finish it I can't

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:40,060
honestly countries what we did but

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:43,120
there's been like 44,000 commits on huge

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,029
area we factored that that would had

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:51,209
never taken place but now that we had at

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:51,209
least amounts of three times working

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,220
to try the different contact with the

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,829
area - were working on a scalable ncx

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:03,050
for an ESP so honestly it's the email

00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:06,870
and sending emails for Bruton bad people

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:10,440
so we were dealing with a lot of traffic

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:13,950
and they had very complex infrastructure

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,560
that's on plastics and they contacted me

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,420
because they wanted to know if if first

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,079
we could simplify the structure and

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:25,410
second we could scale to the 20 plus

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,300
social what I had what about certain

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,190
posting servers but it was not for

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,290
performance in prison it was just that

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,200
the setup was so complex that the

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:38,550
easiest way were to split it into many

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:41,130
instances so we did a lot of ping pong

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:44,130
exchanges see what they needed

00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:46,019
everything and we ended up with wizard

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,209
first proof of concept using openness

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,089
and CPD which could replace the

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:53,130
configuration file with a simple twenty

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:56,940
line configuration file which was like a

00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:59,940
huge improvement for them and we proved

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,709
that we could completely scale to the

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,949
same volume as they did with the search

00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:08,550
in most instances versus one of the

00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:10,829
incentive incidents but we had to

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,449
optimize and make a lot of tuna because

00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:15,149
we were not projection with him and the

00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:16,860
sponsorship began and we were kind of

00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:22,490
scared that they would cut it and we had

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:26,100
to fix things like four months later the

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,110
people operating the infrastructure they

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,800
just were too polite enough to start

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,470
replacing instance with open identities

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,500
so that was quite nice point because we

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:41,220
are the first really real case of large

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,740
volume set up sending Leonel through

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,300
just everyone on the internet so all

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:51,990
cases of broken there are see

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:54,010
implementation after year enough we

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,110
decided that we

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,240
general to present here like openness

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,780
into the erequest it's ours and was not

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,420
the proper the proper tool for dirt job

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:08,620
which is not to accept a lot of mail but

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:12,640
rather to root a lot of men to Internet

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,370
I got cast on the reason but there's a

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,770
lot of overhead he's trying to not lose

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,650
man and to be a Tony from comets inside

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:24,370
that you when the actual news earth

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,480
doesn't need to add this so we had to

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,450
make a try

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,280
is there a key either we try to make up

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,880
an essence beneath it so we could keep

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,430
the sponsorship going which was not that

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,640
dishonest but not really like in our

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,530
best interests or just tell them ok

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,650
let's end the sponsorship you write a

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:47,710
custom tool for you and people are open

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,680
SMTP clear general-purpose interior so

00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:53,080
that's the things we did it was not even

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,130
a debate we had the discussion on the

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,830
front for five minutes

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,180
those it with that now the best interest

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,860
for the project is just when the

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:08,320
sponsorship and keep open SMTP and

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,210
impacted by design choices so during the

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,150
sponsored openness in speedy development

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,400
we learned the very high volume

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:18,610
environment which each met asleep

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:21,510
possibly any in general we could imagine

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,850
from bottlenecks to work through servers

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,610
not completely respecting the RFC

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:31,120
or having kind of artistic

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:33,810
interpretations of the RC so which was

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,400
nice because due to the high volume

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:40,020
environment this kinds of web that could

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:43,300
never hit in our own tests with the

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,850
open-source community they would be very

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,740
nice so we would deploy in version could

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:51,670
break after five minutes we would start

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,650
the beginning and prospects and we had

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,920
to demised pretty much everything from

00:16:53,650 --> 00:17:01,690
disk space to disk usage CPU to memory

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,630
usage as well and what was really

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,550
nice that there are stones were

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,650
completely respected the deal which was

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,740
they would not interfere and how we

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,540
worked is open SNC today so they

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,319
basically it always make something that

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,850
works and they never never had I don't

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,670
think it's someone even look at the cut

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,829
size every canal they just trusted us to

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,189
deploy it and to fix if something was

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,870
wrong

00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:32,110
and since essentially is a such a nice

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:36,130
restful protocol or tailored we we could

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,960
just let it fail find the time to not

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,480
too long but we could spend a little

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,790
time increasing with the proper solution

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,870
implemented and touch the proper

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:51,010
solution so everything happened in our

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:53,050
men brunch so we did not have a part

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:57,690
everything fix for them who I speak

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,690
solitude which was really really nice

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:04,420
finally about this once worship we have

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,430
a lone pair of cow because it was very

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,710
very intense work full-time on the on

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,840
the project and it's very hard to go

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,460
back to just working a few hours here

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,040
and there because you know that you will

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,290
not something that that see that section

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,970
five days will take many weeks because

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,760
we just don't have the time through to

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:25,510
spend on it so it took a bit of time it

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,790
was kind of frustrating but and also we

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,510
needed to just do something that's not

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:33,790
related for a challenge that's after a

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,490
while we we reasoned work on it because

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,710
there's many things that are not part of

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,660
their issues that are very interesting

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:47,620
to us and that we can only do the

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:50,410
parasympathetic experiments so summary

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,480
we worked that big and here that's

00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,930
completely not open source and not

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,000
general purpose many of the ideas we are

00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,710
brought back to open SST there are

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,500
something that's that's are meaningful

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,680
to us and something that outside of

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,770
their own history scale makes no sense

00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,200
so

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,840
it's kind of still benefits the

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,820
knowledge from that other and Siri kind

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,960
of benefits to openness into me

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:26,010
anyway so that was something someone

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:30,000
sent me the next thing even wrote at the

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:31,770
end I tend to read a lot on the internet

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,690
people discouraging everyone from

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:39,570
installing their own bad server because

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:43,049
it's so hard and you should study this

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:47,070
would run it at Yahoo Gmail or Microsoft

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:49,710
and well I I do believe that not every

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:53,760
one on earth should install the mail

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:56,419
server I think giving me involved this

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,200
power trio for big companies is not

00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:02,640
racing and if the reason why is because

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:07,409
instantly a mere server is complex we

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,600
should just make it simple so in my

00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:13,169
opinion the design we have put today is

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,799
quite good it evolved a lot in the last

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:20,370
few years it was not perfect and it is

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:24,649
not perfect but it's just it's the

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,649
design I would use if I started today I

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,220
[Applause]

00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:45,510
don't own the copyright to this but I'll

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:47,250
ask the fine guy so the design is

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,470
playing quite good main opinion today

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,450
and with the also the experience of

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,760
writing that order energy and every

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:58,740
chasm has also written as heard one I

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,899
recall correctly we cannot have an optic

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,600
back to know what what was wrong in the

00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:06,330
initial way we thought about their

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,919
service if we started today I think I'd

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,350
go with the same design I change many

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,600
many things many api's but the design

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,760
the way we speak the processes and

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,480
everything I would keep the the way we

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,690
did it today it's an evolution came from

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,690
men

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,550
incremental developments we still have

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,070
many many things we want to intrude but

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:38,700
it's mostly today about patterns and an

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:41,670
API we had we had a budget so I see many

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,040
people have pointed for it I had it when

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,630
we worked at a major security company

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,240
and asked me if you could do an edit

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:52,170
over a few months they determined it was

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,070
which was very very impressive and they

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,950
found many main thing about the master

00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:01,860
most of it eventually turned into a ten

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,830
year of service and opinion due to both

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,360
the design and the mitigation mechanism

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,730
that are a part of the Navy

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:16,170
so it's clearly said that from the

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:17,280
catastrophe we have fixed fix on the

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,770
critical issues

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,350
and we have seen a backlog of small

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:25,920
improvement to make to prevent terror

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:28,380
attack with Nara still virgin and she is

00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,720
dense we also include concern with new

00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:34,050
things that were introduced in up in VSD

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,720
till will have thought about legend I'll

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:39,480
have a couple slides about it to which

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,880
which are good way to improve the design

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,550
program so a policing

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,030
it is a multi-process demon and she's a

00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:50,910
PS output as you see we have three users

00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:53,250
we have seven processes

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:57,480
toolbar bad names that this is going to

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:59,760
change soon this is religious separation

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,880
in action and every process has a very

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,070
well-defined set of tasks to achieve and

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,320
this this has been refined over the

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,780
years and we find treasure when

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,530
introduced played with which kind of

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:18,240
exposed at the valuation players instead

00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:20,040
inside so what I like about the design

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,830
while I say that I would keep the same

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,220
is that because each of these processes

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:29,830
has a very very

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,330
simple set of tests and it makes sense

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,789
for each process the look at process

00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,190
only does we kept since the trooper says

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,250
all in just shooting all the schedule

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,380
without scheduling things and there's no

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,000
out passing this there's no access to

00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,890
because then by any process that's not

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,789
good Q etcetera etcetera and that was

00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:52,659
not the case this is evolution from from

00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:55,020
trying to make it better design except

00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:58,630
for parent there's not alleged process

00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,490
we still have to have a village process

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,000
because we bind at the village spot do

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,010
system authentication and we went to

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,080
deliveries we read some of the

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:12,340
privileges of the end-user so we have to

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,320
about drop the edges together so we can

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,260
get rid of it we have some cut pass that

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,039
bypasses the privilege process for

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:23,440
instance if you use say - real

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,380
identification it doesn't need to go up

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,230
to the process so it will bypass you

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,059
will never have the privilege process

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,330
except for lookup and parents all

00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:39,630
processes are running English route we

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:42,279
can't reduce access to result from

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,850
possibly configuration file for mate on

00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,490
the history or anything and one thing

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,899
that we did not have at first but

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,820
changes a few years ago was to separate

00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:55,779
the privileges from the two so that if

00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,990
process space in the network was

00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:02,020
compromised not be able to destroy piles

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:07,480
in the two autopilot that you so we have

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:10,149
a very type restricted sets of two

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,370
villages most communication is done

00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:15,220
through IPC we don't have memory

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:18,640
processes we used to do it many many

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,500
many years ago and made an effort to get

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:27,039
rid of that cut and only use the a

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:31,059
message from any thank you and processes

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:35,620
are all credit those were all can reject

00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:39,080
because most happen essentially

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:42,420
forfeiture API

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,850
open smtp on the y-axis is a very tiny

00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,550
interface to access to access any kind

00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:50,220
of portraiture read the schedule are the

00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,770
two it allows us to test because it

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:57,030
allows people to writes new backends for

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:59,670
our subsystem and allows this to happen

00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:03,930
results our contribution so someone

00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:06,750
could write say q PostgreSQL and run it

00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:09,420
without having to have us add the

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:12,390
dependency twins and i explained the

00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,070
whole fortune this is the the table that

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,140
came the table is the mechanism wheels

00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,180
for all kinds of the cap you have to

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,400
implement config up and at the close

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,610
loop website separation and then you can

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:28,650
have your own look-up on in your own

00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:30,800
document but the redevelopment doesn't

00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:33,720
matter the idea was to show that we have

00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:37,470
we have something called operations

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:41,670
extras which experiments the api is

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:43,650
worth so this is the table with the caps

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,740
of our edges kneecaps or paws us two

00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:49,350
tabs over s collide as you see the main

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,990
concern because we build standalone each

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:56,340
channels which in its own memory space

00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:57,750
and the fat is not really tricky it's

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,120
kind of simple and we have the same

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,520
folder to so you can technically right

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:07,560
at you that's not using the file system

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:11,580
and all got to do is increment 10 or so

00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:18,300
primitive that manages you care for and

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:23,640
lots of messages we don't know where

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:26,580
we'll implement our next bag I honestly

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,390
don't think I can write the card that's

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:33,480
battery so the idea that we we have to

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,900
take this into account and assume that

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,430
the table will will be broken and

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,560
transition to a known problem so how do

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:44,370
we do this we look at the process say

00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,560
say funny process which hand of Roland

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:51,050
for openness and speeded it faces the

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:54,140
network which it's kind of hurt

00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:58,430
serious attacks or place coordinates in

00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:00,200
3d so we will just assume that unethical

00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,120
will manage to corrupt everything in its

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,460
and fully control the process so what

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,430
can we do to make this a known problem

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,250
so this is where we start dropping the

00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:12,620
privileges routing it and trying to see

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,420
what my messages and send to other

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,040
processes to do the devil steps

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:20,270
so this person doesn't have to do it

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:22,280
okay so the idea is to really turn a

00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,620
remote code execution from them into a

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,420
known problem okay it will not be

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,990
something that we enjoy but it will be

00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:33,320
something that we will not turn into

00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:36,440
just a nightmare when we prefer to have

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,620
a Daniel 2 remote code execution or

00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,140
privileges escalation so if we can make

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:46,400
a cut path detect that that something is

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:49,340
just not normal and abort exists this is

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,440
the way we do it because we'd rather

00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,440
have someone tell us our openness and to

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,600
be fresh here's the this text which

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,760
succeeds is gone then having someone

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:04,280
tell about my server that we compromised

00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:07,310
and so we try to rainbow the bar of

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:12,800
attack to make it as simple as possible

00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:14,600
order of that occurs we use an example

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,520
of this is we used iMessage framework

00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,500
which sells message passing between the

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:24,110
operations feeding and every throughout

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:27,640
interpreters poke and prod which adds

00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:30,350
types and checks over messages so the

00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,660
iMessage framework place you pass

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:35,240
structure or anything it doesn't really

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,070
find much things about it you can add

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,670
your own checks but it doesn't do a lot

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:43,460
of verification we add just a layer on

00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:46,160
top so we can see the data that could

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,350
pass in the message which is decimalised

00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,750
on the other end and that anything that

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:53,990
that just doesn't this area is politely

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,850
we'll just figure out a town I made so

00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,400
this is an example on the same side we

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:01,049
create a message we add an item the

00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,029
entire inside it we close that I said

00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,369
this is gonna set on the other side with

00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:07,559
rides on packet if there's something

00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:09,419
left after they get ID if there's

00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,629
something left wouldn't call the mmm

00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:15,960
function is going to abort me gets more

00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:21,960
or less at our robot so it's kind of

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:25,889
freaking out to corrupt the NSA j0

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,259
introduced the pledge system polled you

00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:30,960
probably know by now the idea was to

00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:34,049
classify system falls into categories of

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,330
artisan cold and alone will profess to

00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:39,179
rest with which system calls would be

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:42,239
used from a different point of the

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,389
Egyptian and any process by roads in the

00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:49,259
the the table we all just be about the

00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:54,149
way that camped right dropped so the the

00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:57,299
general argument in general that you

00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:59,159
have a lot of pepper from the demands

00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:01,230
torture then you have the event loop

00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,809
which does only a very very limited

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,820
subject of system code so the ideals

00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:09,239
that you another whole system code so

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:12,509
the demon can properly set up then right

00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:14,700
before entering the inner group to just

00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:20,940
say no no now you can only do STI you

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:27,359
earlier location it becomes a pattern

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:30,350
that's really easy to follow and what is

00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:33,269
nice about pledge my opinion it is that

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,399
it's it lets you see that you your

00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:38,669
assumption about what your program does

00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:40,980
are correct so we tend to use libraries

00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:43,109
and we often assume that the library is

00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,570
doing something and this spends up think

00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:47,489
that your assumption is right because if

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,529
you did not allow attached

00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:52,889
let the library do something it will

00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:54,899
just about your process and it can

00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:57,690
expose a big layer of evaluation that

00:31:54,899 --> 00:32:01,019
that's you doing something in the

00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:04,950
process and the playlists in it's just a

00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:08,390
bit wrong because Dalton said spinner if

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:11,090
I had to if I had to add time system

00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:13,880
Edge's that process something would be

00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:16,400
wrong and if I don't add it and process

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,820
use it it gets aborted so it lets you

00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:25,100
refactor the code to match your

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:28,900
expectations so we have to pledge very

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:32,660
early thanks to - you came to million

00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:34,850
family asked me to do the change back

00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:38,300
we pledge muster focus on to be

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:41,870
overnights but we initially it was very

00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:46,310
very permissive pledges and we started

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:48,650
reducing as we put refactored as well

00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:51,950
and many people see pledge as a security

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:55,130
feature and this is how most people talk

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:58,520
about page to me because you can prevent

00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:01,430
a shellcode from executing something I

00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,650
have the proper pledge but in my opinion

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,210
it's really a quality picture because it

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,430
lets you see that something is wrong

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:10,370
with the designer it lets you the to

00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:11,810
prepare and encourage beforehand you

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,460
will see that something is wrong when

00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,570
you start adding system call to your

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:20,150
process that will make the double track

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:23,080
so nowadays we have quite tight pledges

00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,280
and we even have edges that are

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,320
different depending on the purpose you

00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,030
are taking because we know that we will

00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:34,430
no longer need something you can receive

00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:37,340
further also a PSD provide out of the

00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:39,110
box SR and randomize malach so every

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,820
time you run up in essentially you get a

00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:46,250
different memory layout and children

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:49,220
make molecules they were so diverging

00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,620
with the maracle's okay for privilege

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,090
separation we still have the parent

00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,820
process for him in e-learning in

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:59,030
children and they all inherit the memory

00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:02,210
layout of the parent except for the the

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:04,550
malach differences and that was not

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,220
about that was like oh we search it from

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:11,030
deep and during your hackathon in

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,870
Cambridge to call for a return a further

00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:17,240
and kind of a specific we could just

00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:19,910
really exact research to be in essence

00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,590
bidding after court so that we get a new

00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,440
day

00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:26,860
memory layout so this randomizes

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,400
everything again and the global

00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,020
structures that that were inherited by

00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,260
throat I'm no longer inherited by

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:38,110
functions or overwritten wisdom in

00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:41,440
memory segments of the program so this

00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:44,800
would avoid from possible attacks and

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,200
makes things more on them so I thought

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,750
it would be quite tricky and well it's a

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,690
very wrong time for me but Eric managed

00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,440
to beat really fast which is pretty

00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,230
impressive

00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,400
it just came to me with the small

00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,870
because he had done England so that's

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,940
nice

00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:07,540
basically at start of the parent process

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,180
we'll just do the bootstrap like it did

00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:12,760
before and instead of continuing the

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:16,270
configuration will be narrated compute

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,580
third population parse configuration but

00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:21,580
it does it just reads a get up the parts

00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:25,960
car get up it's the option so can resume

00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:28,060
knowing what had some so now only

00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:33,520
refined the scriptures that are required

00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:37,120
for the I PCR or narrative and I think I

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,310
heard you asked us to possibly be exact

00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,430
purposes at some time let me know and

00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:44,670
then so that might happen I don't know

00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:50,020
when it might happen but it's not

00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:52,720
analytic so so I won't stay long believe

00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:57,490
that this shows SLR and random ballad

00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:00,610
from on a pen deity with every led with

00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:03,490
training now the same with work which

00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:05,560
showed that some of the say the Millat

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:08,590
before the fourth day they which ends

00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,840
and addressing the child when you add

00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:13,360
the exact which otherwise to put the

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,880
tops of the process memories so you now

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,090
have completely different memorials

00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,250
which children prominence

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,020
so I originally wanted to go through all

00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:27,670
components of innocence Italy because we

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:30,180
did so much I have made so many slides

00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:35,140
right - just a

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:38,830
and we can have cat about this after so

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:42,130
I just talked about Ulysses what quality

00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:44,339
was most important part dollars in the

00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:48,550
last few years because we were running

00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:51,400
quite critical construction so we had to

00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:53,020
be confident that machine block and also

00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,480
the same part goes to the community so

00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,849
if something is broken we get wait a

00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,680
minute now so we want to be quite

00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:07,630
assured that the economy lead was okay

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:09,790
some errors are hard to get Diggs

00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,170
alternate email or insertions in this

00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,320
paper

00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,630
someone sum up indeed we had to send me

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,810
ml a while ago because neither died when

00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,290
which was just that were predictable for

00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,260
me

00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:26,020
she wrote to a session but he suspended

00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,790
his laptop and some Commission figured

00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,770
the crush of the government a ton of the

00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:33,670
robots so this kind of burger are really

00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:36,580
hard first we produce so usually during

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:39,599
development return by adding crud just

00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:43,570
switch the conditions how it breaks

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:48,430
revert it before it emits sometimes it's

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:51,839
much much harder but that means you can

00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:54,310
just do this we find other ways

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,589
everything up instance kind of with

00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,900
scripting language SMTP script which

00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:02,310
lets you strict messenger possession

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:05,260
it's nice it's not openness and really

00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:09,040
it's not tied to openness on screen can

00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,349
use this with other interpretation it

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,619
lets us test that the SMTP server side

00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:16,960
has not had a radiation we tend to we

00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:19,690
used this a lot before we kind of less

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:24,010
which then because it's not the area we

00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:26,589
work the most on now we relied a lot on

00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,710
cut with you in charge information trip

00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:32,500
to the natives and exchange with

00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:36,550
ourselves we use a static analysis tools

00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,770
like coverage and ceilings can build and

00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,830
we had another mechanism which have low

00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,250
explained a few minutes so this is these

00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,840
are

00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:47,140
and reverb guitar triggered by the

00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:52,630
privations can don't they just evened

00:38:47,140 --> 00:39:02,730
the human reading at least my oops oops

00:38:52,630 --> 00:39:02,730
oops so I don't know the end recover

00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:12,820
okay so we can with a specific special

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,830
branch more pleasantly in 12 inspired by

00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,240
Netflix and it's cows monkey and I don't

00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,940
know if one knows what it is but

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,740
basically the idea is that your server

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,410
infrastructure is supposed to be so

00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,900
sorry net variable that you can shoot

00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,650
down servers at random and should not be

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:31,240
a problem so they have this tool called

00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:34,599
chaos multi which will just shut down

00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,010
stone walls from them and I thought it

00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:39,250
would be nice not the same thing for

00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:43,150
since PD because most hurricane I'm

00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:45,670
supposed to give temporary trailers for

00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:48,760
them to do there are errors that are

00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,920
meant to be fun and you can't write

00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,950
lists but they are usually done at the

00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,070
at the setup place and most hours during

00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:59,109
runtime are supposed to just result in

00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,280
temporary fillers the order in three

00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:03,760
eight trigrams

00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:07,450
so most system calls should be okay and

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,640
results more fun very clever so let's

00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:12,280
have some of them played at random since

00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:16,680
this should not be an issue so I

00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,550
introduced this special branch right

00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,859
education perverse

00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,660
I added some latency in some in I

00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:26,770
message processing just to see how it

00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:32,260
would grow and we started using the

00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:35,040
multi branch did did not go up took me a

00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:40,630
whole day to fix all possible cases of

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:43,210
the demon exploding fix it

00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,940
wrap up our quartiles left at all

00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:48,160
because we assumed the billing for the

00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:51,220
best way to handle them that many cases

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,770
but it was too too harsh as a way to

00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,130
handle this particular error so what we

00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:59,370
did when we

00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:01,410
we first did a full fatale on it just to

00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:05,820
check where it well wasn't in the setup

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:08,670
process or at run time and once we

00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,790
eliminated a few we started receiving

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:15,750
the monkey runs just to see back again

00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:18,600
so we turned a few cattle calls into

00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:22,980
temporary errors we're under branch we

00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:27,090
wait part just explode and fix and try

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,460
again this is done when we can run the

00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:33,710
pudding for hours on the branch without

00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:38,540
issues so it's not rocket science

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,540
add add better implementation at

00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:47,580
basically I add this one can return that

00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:52,950
run denied let's a randomized inner when

00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:56,610
we add wonderful specification and this

00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:59,070
is the kind of dog food but one liner

00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:02,040
that you would never see because they

00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,930
are most always in the error code page

00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,870
since you're triggering arrows that

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:09,480
never happened so what happened here is

00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:14,760
that we didn't have this footer and the

00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:19,100
switch turn back to at Auto you also use

00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:21,840
Twitter as well community trading - we

00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:24,210
don't do this often that we did it at

00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,150
least once a year we just make a call

00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:30,450
for people to just threw this on

00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:33,750
specific instance we have and the idea

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:37,260
that despatched a lot of pressure on the

00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:40,110
rare instance we run when it's it lets

00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:43,080
us test things in a way that's kind of

00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:45,240
less saying that what we do ourselves on

00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:48,780
our one machine because you have a wide

00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,490
range of clients connecting to you some

00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,320
people write their own script

00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:58,650
good or bad and some are using TLS on

00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:01,140
ipv6 some are a price or low connection

00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:03,510
and they don't send you the semester you

00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,720
are just absolute chaos coming to the

00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:09,390
server and initially took four hours and

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,390
it's partly because Collett

00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,810
but regressions quite fast

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:18,150
we won't list weapon because even when

00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:21,510
you tell their community to stop reading

00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:24,210
they will just continue so we tend to do

00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:26,640
it only when we have like major change

00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:29,130
in a sense if you later or in Sierra and

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,750
we can let do instance run for days

00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:38,550
without donation so our plans for the

00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:41,520
future we had many many men I will not

00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,140
close all of them just not doable we

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,750
have tickets that are opened since

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:50,690
over-swinging because we just don't have

00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:53,130
the manpower to handle them first

00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,460
project is to improve the population

00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,260
pile

00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,420
so this is the current default

00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,280
configuration tab which is for line

00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,850
she's the one that's shipped with

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,250
OpenBSD my little drawers except Nell

00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:07,620
for your machine let you see you relate

00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:12,570
a man outside but it's not opened for

00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:16,410
the outside to marijuana it's a note on

00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:20,060
that it's basically what was done ten

00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:22,530
years ago I know a date along the way

00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,680
it's very simple and blessed people come

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,360
to me simply because of that time some

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,450
come because of the design let's travel

00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:33,150
most people just three or four lines

00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:35,760
cutting verses and red lines talking and

00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:41,190
they click this one it fits almost as

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:44,280
plain English except for work on I'll go

00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:47,460
see will be working that doesn't require

00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,650
too much thinking and we can easily

00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,110
achieve much more complex for tourism

00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,840
controversial plans with not so many

00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:58,100
much line you can actually write it from

00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:01,590
scratch without editing an example file

00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,820
yes a bit of being used to it that can

00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:05,430
easily

00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:08,700
you don't have to add a book to manage

00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:10,700
to make sure our own company we're not

00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,230
going to pursue this is just show you

00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:15,270
the finished pilot the configuration

00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:18,540
problem that I used for my own with TLS

00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:21,930
of multiple IP multiple listeners the

00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:25,170
king at say I am primary domains back up

00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:27,090
the walls I'll publish it home and iPad

00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:32,240
people that Kundalini so I don't receive

00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:35,609
their mail anymore and this is 15 right

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:39,930
and can actually do virtually complex

00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:44,340
stuff is that there is a flow with this

00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:46,530
it came from the no assumption that one

00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,880
line would be out from the best

00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,480
pollution to all programs throughout

00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,280
everything it's in one line but there's

00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,460
a difference between the condition and

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,619
the action which I'd make read on you

00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,150
can spot the difference there's one

00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:01,920
thing that sent drones when the man

00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,350
enters the system and there's one scene

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,420
that and all when the men's anyone and

00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:09,150
the fact that you make it fit on one

00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:12,420
line turn the dissenter sings into and

00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:14,280
kind of anatomy cool and you are not

00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,560
longer allowed to change it later

00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,100
because essentially you would not know

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,740
which box re which will match earlier

00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:24,720
since it's normally single so i won't i

00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:28,320
won't spend much time on this

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,410
conditional distance it's a tricky it's

00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,930
kind of related to listen to people from

00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:36,090
section one the way we solve this was

00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,670
just not right it works which is red

00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:41,280
coils a lot of crud which which is today

00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,320
preventing us from making mini progress

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:48,300
but we always have to work around

00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:50,910
and so the idea that we should just

00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,710
accept that these are two separate

00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:56,660
things and that they should be split

00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:59,190
into separate concept an action and then

00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,020
match the rule and you're introduced in

00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:05,580
under match the action when you actually

00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:07,380
try to do something and this this simple

00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:11,790
in direction and that many many one

00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:15,350
problem without you because quite

00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:19,620
written quite requested feature

00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:21,900
we have a very bad issues well which is

00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:24,660
that you accepted me and I said since we

00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,100
have mapped rule when they accepted they

00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,550
said you can no longer change the

00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:33,750
direction after work it's a new god

00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:36,030
population firewall envelopes that were

00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,770
accepted are just going to go with the

00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,840
oven no matter if you change the

00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,550
configuration file and there is no way

00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:45,510
with the trend then click this and this

00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:48,990
is the way to solve this we have already

00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:52,770
the most of the work with Eric this

00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:55,500
model we don't intend to really dis soon

00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,600
we intend to skip the upcoming been

00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:03,000
build a village because it's too close

00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:05,000
first fully get it tested but we we are

00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,640
almost like many person done with this

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,010
it said a lot it simplifies something

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,600
they are the poles just shown that the

00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:18,930
whole design was not so known correct

00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:21,930
population plan as I said we've been

00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:25,920
using high volume everyone lends the the

00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:29,850
first area is quite good with a be done

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,790
before the layer is quite good but it's

00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:37,650
grown complex because we always faced

00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:39,960
new issues which had intuitive solutions

00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:42,390
which piled up until we have now a

00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,490
complex layer that works that is the

00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:47,340
nightmare to work on so we're going to

00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:48,840
clean up this we had Dane which is one

00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,540
which had been requested quite a few

00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,840
times I had a pub to do this it was

00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:56,730
working but not committed all because

00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:59,700
just hacked something to see through to

00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:03,270
origin so I need to bring this back to

00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:05,520
life and commit it and we have other

00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:10,200
features in the process we'll discuss

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:13,800
this later patrol on the suppressor we

00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,840
have great what's the Rosanna tricep

00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,340
oppressor when they offered the hardly

00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,100
teacher

00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:22,050
this means the dojo squad outside of the

00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,210
process facing the network and people

00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:25,210
are now asking for in CSS support so we

00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,330
have to do the same work

00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:31,240
which is just not trivial we're going to

00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:34,770
be working that it requires to be the

00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:38,580
proper mindset to open Excel Connie I

00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:41,770
have a dream actually children open

00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:44,440
direct support in operations PD because

00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:47,950
having to write this instead of this is

00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:51,030
just not right to me I'd prefer to have

00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:53,410
the simplest cut for the cheapest part

00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,420
that would not mean that you can't use

00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:58,540
operation CPD without myself just that

00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:00,340
we have to have a layer to abstract we

00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:03,460
have to bring your lip TLS wrapper on

00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:05,950
top of OpenSSL this is not doable today

00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,200
without hurting our community I often

00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:10,270
asked on the Bellamy's on Twitter we

00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,880
would be affected if we do that if we

00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:16,540
did that it's still all to him to many

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,770
people and the main reason is not just

00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:22,270
to promote leave my cell which it would

00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:25,030
be nice but that's not my main reason

00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,770
the main reason is because we have ETF's

00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:29,080
kind of everywhere to walk around

00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,300
special dish was that had disabled that

00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:35,380
this world adoption and because we had

00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:38,670
two or three cases of they release the

00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:42,010
new date with patch level upgrade and

00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:44,710
they managed to slip an epi a change in

00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:46,780
it which brought for us and then so the

00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:49,120
numerous forms is now people telling us

00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,620
you brought something and we didn't

00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,380
change in cod but we still have to find

00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:55,620
work or another that was the case of it

00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:59,050
that kind of pissed me off

00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:02,140
and finder which is what I will ending

00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:05,890
on the filter RP is something that many

00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:08,530
people have been asking its allows to

00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:13,030
altered working as an opposition in

00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:15,250
direct data Jake reception success etc

00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:17,680
people want then really badly

00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:22,360
I keep getting messages about it and I

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:24,070
know it's top priority project but the

00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,780
program is not the interface the problem

00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:28,420
is how we plug the interface on it so

00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:31,180
it's not because we don't want to use my

00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:33,010
mentor or or insidious because even if

00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,020
you wanted to do that we have some

00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:39,790
things that we want in the India

00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:41,140
yeah and still get to do the plan among

00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,940
the many things we want in it we want

00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,990
filters to run different memory spaces

00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:47,680
different users

00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:50,320
fruited want to be able to interact with

00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,330
any user input or output and we have

00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,119
pretty much all of this but in the

00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:58,450
current design we got we have something

00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,580
unfixable so we decided to just not try

00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:02,920
to hide it but to find the proper

00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:04,750
solution and the program is mainly

00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,580
because everything is entangled with the

00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,619
centipede state machine so whenever

00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,420
whenever try to do something in filters

00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:12,869
we're going to break something and you

00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:18,550
need everyone to start looking at it and

00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:20,470
how to fix which is not easy so our plan

00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:23,560
is to go from this also check without

00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:26,410
rolling us every few every few days

00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:29,050
months with this on to inject without

00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:32,320
trying for all the falling head the last

00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:34,890
few months so we will be introducing

00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,660
SMTP DVD which is a separate daemon

00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:39,760
basically kind of time SMTV proxy which

00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,700
does a man in the middle of a centipede

00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,520
session and it allows us to reuse all

00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:48,070
the code we we already wrote for filters

00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,420
but just have two separate state machine

00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:54,580
instead of trying to have a spaghetti

00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:56,470
one basically inclusive row lines using

00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:59,500
a small vertical it's establishes a

00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:04,300
connection back to essentially openness

00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:06,040
and speedy and openness m50 has a layer

00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,200
controlling your client back to it I

00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,910
will have at fault because everything is

00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,119
likely going to have to do a talk about

00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:16,090
this so I won't enter too much into the

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,640
detail but this is source this is not

00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:19,720
just an idea we have a working listen to

00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,160
PFD

00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:25,450
we will publish it soon we we don't want

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,550
when can't release it right now

00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:29,710
obviously because it it did not have

00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:32,410
enough testing which has zero zero

00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:36,990
testing but we release it for testing

00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:40,310
shortly and our targets is up in a 6-3

00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:44,900
so every just learned that's going to

00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:47,810
during a talk about it and I think is

00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,760
not tied to openness and speedy so you

00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,180
can technically trick it to something

00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,030
else

00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:54,950
so finally we have many small project

00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,900
that we'll be having so she wants an SP

00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:59,780
a feature I wanted tool to automatically

00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,970
have GLS at startup and we we are

00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,390
playing with extended essentially

00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:09,860
extensions to to make something parents

00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:12,460
can discuss this with you the whole

00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:15,530
purpose take the cards but beg for them

00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:17,390
contribute right in features have closed

00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,120
program enforce because we have many

00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:23,990
many or certainly not very technical

00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:26,810
they are just they just require your

00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:29,330
time donates to the open beta definition

00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:31,370
so we can have Agathon's and you can

00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:33,290
sponsor development of teachers and find

00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:35,500
sponsors for developmental feature

00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:38,980
that's nice

00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,980
we're still hiring

00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,239
[Applause]

00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:51,310
[Music]

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,460
[Applause]

00:54:51,310 --> 00:55:05,869
[Music]

00:54:54,460 --> 00:55:09,400
are there any questions very fast one

00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,400
UCP support please

00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:28,430
thank you for the talk just a small

00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:32,599
remark don't use green and red on your

00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:37,710
slides there is some people cannot see

00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:39,790
that well I am okay but for the others

00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:43,280
[Music]

00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:45,920
do you plan on Integrative filtering in

00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:51,619
the real ad or is it sensible to do

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:54,109
something like that yeah because you'd

00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:59,420
basically plug it between the clients

00:55:54,109 --> 00:56:03,619
and SMTP server so and you have just

00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:05,470
acidity or already there maybe don't

00:56:03,619 --> 00:56:08,580
need another demon I don't know

00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,580
[Music]

00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:17,900
oh sorry I thought you could do

00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:23,270
filtering in real ad maybe oh maybe I

00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:26,270
don't know maybe maybe we talked about

00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:30,589
it but I don't know if you want to read

00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:33,319
relay do with SMTP specific filter the

00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:35,030
filter on demand is really not complex

00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:37,579
what's complex is having both and

00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:41,240
tangled having two SMTP enzymes

00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:43,720
entangled so the recipe record is really

00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:47,440
really simple

00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,440
any more questions

00:56:54,010 --> 00:57:03,740
about the SPF feature do you think this

00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:04,960
will be a filter or is it the place

00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:08,780
where it should be

00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,270
it's a common demand I think we can be

00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:13,849
it can be used with can be fixed sorry

00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:18,050
with the SPF feature that zero ones need

00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:20,810
to work with you right but why not make

00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:26,570
it also a filter because it's not really

00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:36,140
hard let's play a filter there was

00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:38,990
another one I'm just for a stay SMTP FD

00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:43,160
do you plan to edit as incoming and

00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:45,200
outgoing innocent TPD well initially I

00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:48,830
thought we needed both and then Eric

00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:51,260
made a very clever comment that when

00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:53,720
you're accepting mail for the outgoing

00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,250
route it's still incoming into an SMTP

00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,890
transaction so you can have only the

00:57:55,250 --> 00:58:01,660
SMTP filtering then it will apply it

00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:11,089
well now it's kind of counterintuitive

00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:16,420
but yeah it works ok when there are no

00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:16,420
