                      to sneak in some of the Polish history                                so we have in our history we had those                                winked whose ours it was the most                                beautiful and very very efficient                                cavalry in history it was it is                                recognized by many as the greatest                                coupling in human history basically it                                was created in                                                                                                                             they often and the default on many                                buttons it wasn't that they were idle I                                would like to show you a short clip so                                you can so you can see how they worked                                you                                okay let's not be too serious first of                                all I would like to thank many people of                                course is impossible to organize                                conference for one person so I have a                                lot of people to thank you i'm sure i                                forgot about some but i want to                                highlight how helpful you're busy khan                                foundation was they helped really a lot                                and this conference couldn't make it                                without them and also i would like to                                thank my youngest son who is trying to                                help by not disturbing and as I said                                it's very impossible to run a conference                                all by yourself but of course there is                                that guy who will tell you in on Sunday                                how to do that so maybe I will rephrase                                if you are not then you are not going                                you cannot run conference all by                                yourself yeah okay I would of course                                like to say a big thanks to our sponsors                                of course we could organize conference                                without sponsors but it would be like                                three times more expensive so we don't                                want to do that we still want to be the                                conference to be affordable so thank you                                very much and of course i would like to                                say thanks to Corgan Iser equity of                                electrical engineering from this                                university they use freebsd a lot there                                they were very helpful we have all the                                 rooms for free and a lot of help from                                 the students so                                 okay some hints I hope I hope you all                                 have your badges so if you take the                                 batch out there is a full agenda inside                                 you have Wi-Fi s seed you have password                                 you have also some phone numbers two                                 taxis so hopefully it would be helpful                                 also it might have been a bit confusing                                 to why we start here because we have                                 almost entire building the old boiler                                 house building that we will help the                                 rest of the conference but there is no                                 room large enough to feed us all so so                                 we had to start here but also it gives                                 you a chance to see the main building                                 which I find very beautiful so hopefully                                 it wasn't too confusing to get here                                 social event we have a great club to                                 hold our social event we have there will
