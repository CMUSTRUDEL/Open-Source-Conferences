	                              hello excellent everybody hear me all                               right sorry further up okay better okay                               all right I'm the leader of the karaoke                               today and we'll be starting off and                               speaking about net pgp and signed                               execution of binaries I'm fairly old                               school I put up a paper here I don't                               think of any proceedings from this this                               conference but feel free to go and have                                a look at it and tell me if it's a                                    or whatever okay the agenda for today                                the building blocks what we're trying to                                do what we're trying to achieve how                                we're going to achieve them an overview                                of digital signatures for those who have                                been off in Mars the last five years or                                whatever pgp identities and trust how we                                do it contrast that to pki how it's done                                there talk a bit about the                                implementation that we that I did and a                                clip to update if there's time for it at                                the end I'm slightly five minutes late                                i've been told i can finish five minutes                                late as well but I over N massively on                                friday so bear with me anybody been to                                any of my talks before yes yes is this                                is all coming flashing back repressed                                memories here okay so you know nobody                                gets what this is so I start you off                                this is a boat that goes from San                                Francisco to Marin County any of anybody                                got a guess know what sorry                                well done well though no one at the end                                is difficult that some brick heck from                                the series the middle but yeah fairy                                eggs heck so that's what we're going to                                be talking about today it gets better                                honestly so very exact it's a subsystem                                it's been a net bsd since                                               guy from Australia corporate limb it                                loads digests into the kernel and it                                does lazy evaluation on these digests                                whenever you encounter a file that's                                about to be opened or exact or anything                                like that there are three ways of doing                                it one is direct so you're going to say                                I'm going to open this file secondly                                this indirect and that's for things that                                get invoked by other things so we'd have                                the shell there for one we'd have                                interpreters there and files which are                                other things configuration files may be                                shared library something like that these                                are the examples that we have here you                                probably can't see them if you want to                                come towards the front and kind of join                                hands and tryna raise living please feel                                free there are aliases in their core                                program script interpreter and library                                as well so very execs very full                                subsystem within that PSD it's also be                                imported to other operating systems as                                well I believe it's a major Ritter                                router manufacturer in California ships                                with with very exec on on freebsd or                                derivation narrow the types of digest                                the usual standard ones and we'll come                                on to digest about later on as well okay                                so what do we have we've got net PDP                                it's the original it was originally a                                gpg clone using the openssl bignum                                numbers to do the MPI arithmetic                                multiplication integers there's a new                                branch in nepi SD it's called a DC net                                PGP standalone you can see I've got                                into the naming things like that that's                                how we do branches within our repository                                and that uses its own API is it doesn't                                use openssl at all so the barrier for                                entry for this is now gone way down we                                no longer have to have openssl in place                                before we can actually verify signatures                                which believe me is a huge benefit you                                can think of applications for it like                                packaging subsystems where you want to                                check out signatures but you don't have                                openssl in place as part of the                                bootstrap and this is one of the things                                that I'll be looking at doing over the                                next few months and this will allow us                                to do signing a principally verification                                of signatures but we could also do                                signing as well and encrypting Krypton                                you don't need the private key for so                                again that's a another thing that that's                                just made for this kind of stuff ok so                                signing I didn't do this is fashion to                                play well on the mac server anything                                that that but if ever you want to know                                 what signing is go to youtube and have a                                 look at this it's a marvelous video                                 really is it's done by a girl as her                                 final in her her american sign language                                 class and she she does the american sign                                 language to see the Greens forget to you                                 I think this is a politically correct                                 way of describing that song right okay                                 so let's go on signing what it does it                                 calculates a digest on the data it adds                                 hash material from the signature when                                 you're signing it adds hash material                                 into the signature and it uses the                                 private key to produce one or two MP is                                 depending whether your RSA rdsa the                                 signature has validity dates as well so                                 that's from and to so you can have                                 signatures that are only valid from a                                 certain date if you want to lease a                                 piece of software or something you don't                                 want it to be you                                 until a later date you can set the from                                 date two months from now something like                                 that also it can expire we've seen that                                 before with various things where                                 people's keys expire they don't notice                                 and interesting things happen                                 verification will fail if the signatures                                 out of date this proves the provenance                                 of something it's not like a digest                                 which is just saying yes this is what we                                 thought we had anybody could write that                                 digest and it's all for you this                                 actually proves the provenance of                                 something because you need the secret                                 key and we need the passphrase hopefully                                 that people have put on the secret key                                 to unlock that so let's talk a bit about                                 identity shall we any polish speakers in                                 the room excellent right this is a                                 Polish driving licence there's a                                 marvelous marvelous marvelous thing from                                 the BBC from                                                          police were looking for a super criminal                                 in ireland he was racking up thousands                                 and thousands of speeding fines parking                                 tickets giving a different address every                                 time and not actually paying the fines                                 he was get off it's getting on their                                 their nerves the irish Guardi and so                                 they they set out looking for him it was                                 discovered says the BBC that the man                                 every member of the Irish police's                                 rank-and-file had been looking for a mr.                                 prowl Yazdi is that right correct me if                                 I'm wrong you know he probably as d                                 wasn't exactly the sort of prized                                 villain whose apprehension leads to an                                 officer winning an award probably as d                                 is polish for driving license so if we                                 go back to the driving licence they've                                 been there writing down the name is that                                 all the time                                 interesting little story on identity                                 make sure you are who you are we do that                                 by looking at the signature that people                                 have put on things same as in the real                                 world if you want to see a check as a                                 signature on it that kind of thing we                                 signed our legal documents with their                                 own signatures and set for me I write                                 with an X obviously we go on to sign                                 files and so I'm going to go into a bit                                 of the implementation NAB what I                                 actually did to enable sign verification                                 of files to take place I added a new                                 bulk signing utility and I was very I                                 was very good and thought a decent name                                 for it i called it multi sign we can do                                 this in a different machine it doesn't                                 have to be on the same machine that                                 we're running it on so we can for                                 example building image and sign the                                 binaries to run there which is quite                                 useful as well for people who are                                 writing firmware images and things like                                 that who are treating the bsd s as very                                 much a firmware up as the firmware for                                 an appliance and there's a fair number                                 of us out there why a separate utility i                                 set it up because a very exact control                                 which is the one that calculates a                                 digest for very exact it's not set up to                                 do public keys or secret key signing or                                 a private keys as well you probably                                 can't see it here I actually took a                                 video late last night of this happening                                 so there we go and that's me shaking as                                 you can do it you can see it's not not                                 too slow and that's                                                    of QuickTime and I tried trimming it I                                 try taking the end off like that but I                                 failed is money you know okay so let's                                 go into something else notes was related                                 to identity that's a question of trust                                 not not a dingbat or anything like that                                 just a funny picture or I thought                                 as any there are two principal ways that                                 we have of engendering trust off of                                 checking trust but finding out what the                                 trust levels are principally the PGP way                                 is to do it with the web of trust with                                 usual six degrees of bacon and things                                 like that we can all be related to kevin                                 bacon in some way within six degrees of                                 freedom so my friend young chairman has                                 a marvelous slide on this that that                                 shows how we are related to them so                                 you're probably all aware of this the                                 the trusted third party is the model                                 that PK I uses that's the young the                                 certifying authority on it's in all the                                 ssl certs things like that and there are                                 benefits and there are drawbacks of both                                 of these anything so look at the issues                                 first for PK I have been some very very                                 well publicized breaches Komodo I think                                 they had a cross-site scripting or                                 something like that but they'd actually                                 got some C sharp libraries on their                                 website that allowed them to do easy                                 signing of keys and somebody found that                                 out did you know tower is the one that                                 was used last year and to force a google                                 search that people are using                                 state-sponsored wise we think anyway                                 trusted third party that's great that's                                 all fine and good as long as we trust                                 the third party have any of these third                                 parties ever at audits done that have                                 been published how they keep their keys                                 normally we're told they keep them in h                                 SMS and secure modules after one side                                 are there gaps between these secure                                 modules in the internet who is access to                                 them who is access to the keys I have                                 absolutely no idea and yet every day I'm                                 trusting my identity and other things on                                 the internet with certs that been                                 provided by these guys people in Iran                                 raina and stuff like that are trusting                                 their lives to it as well anyway a few                                 few issues maybe there's signal single                                 signatories on it as well and it goes                                 right way in a hierarchy right back up                                 to the root which is a obviously itself                                 so what protection do they use of the                                 keys and who guards these guys we don't                                 have a few issues onto the web of trust                                 way of doing it the the key servers yeah                                 really knows them it's the roach motel                                 you check your key into them you never                                 leave there are people there that he's                                 around from                                                              used anymore some people out on the                                 internet have done studies and things                                 like that key to revoke                                                 still being used which is interesting                                 well certainly they're trying to be used                                 people will send email with them there                                 are other things as well that Weber                                 Trust doesn't do well revocations one of                                 them but it's probably better than that                                 the way the pki has of doing it which is                                 to say oh let's go for a new one so the                                 revocation of keys as well everybody                                 around here is a pgp key I imagined and                                 does everybody have a revocation sir                                 good an outstanding number of people                                 here have that yeah okay so which is                                 better so you do a threat analysis on                                 this I know which one I'd prefer I'm not                                 going to say which one is better I know                                 which one I prefer and that's why i've                                 been using PGP for a while anyway net                                 PDP keys which is the key management                                 stuff in that p-gp allows you to get                                 information out of it there's an option                                 in there to use the minus minus trusted                                 keys facility and that gets the key out                                 in a format that we can actually                                 recognize this is important because                                 we're doing stuff in the colonel I don't                                 the colonel to have large libraries of                                 parsing and things like that is just not                                 what it's meant for and so we give it in                                 Nice key value terms there's things down                                 here like the keys itself the creation                                 time on it all time down in seconds                                 obviously we're not interested in time                                 zones or any any other interesting stuff                                 like that version of the pgp key                                 algorithm one is our essay anything and                                 so on from that so why am i bothering                                 with us I mentioned already earlier that                                 RFC                                                                      existing PTP protocols packets as like                                 that and if you're wondering why I'm                                 reinventing wheels and putting in two                                 straight key value stuff let me take you                                 through some of the the the first two                                 bites on a pgp packet so octet zero call                                 Mauch text because we're in Europe the                                 seventh bit is always set on buying                                   hmm game as much fear enough ins just                                 bit unusual but yeah whatever the sixth                                 bit denotes the new format for the keys                                 subversion for other versions through                                 version                                                                  the new one okay so you're with me so                                 far it's not exactly dressed there's                                 only the first two bits of the first                                 bite so in the new format it's                                        the packet tag it's the type of packet                                 that we're having so it's a signature                                 it's a public key the secret key it's a                                 little data one it's a one-pass                                 signature which introduces little data                                 and then is bounded by the signature at                                 the end in the old format it's five to                                 two other packet tank bits                                              a lens type that that's all well and                                 good yeah nothing drastic I'm obviously                                 laboring the point here the new format                                 lens                                 that's interesting as well and we have                                 to deal with both versions three and                                 four because of your signatures that are                                 out there another drawback of PGP in                                 general octet one if the value is less                                 than                                                                     than or equal to                                                     with the second bite that's being a                                                                                                         it's the partial length type so that's                                 the same as HTTP chunked encoding you                                 jump forward into an offset to find the                                 next offset and then you keep on going                                 like this until you get one that isn't a                                 partial length type in which case in                                 yeah then you have the last packet and                                 you've got the whole thing you might                                 think this is torturous but if people                                 are doing signing on implicated where                                 you don't know the length this is                                 typically what's used gpg will sign like                                 this all the time and if octet one is                                                                                                    really don't want to have to deal with                                 that kind of rubbish in the journal so                                 we set it up the trustee key like we                                 have there so let's load that into the                                 kernel and that's what it looks like                                 here you can see right down the bottom                                 with this option there's a piece of                                 green text and there and that's my                                 public key being loaded into the kernel                                 there's a screenshot in the paper if                                 you're having trouble seeing these or if                                 you want to kind of come to the front                                 then please feel free okay very exec has                                 a facility called very exact control                                 which actually loads to digest into the                                 kernel it does it through a device                                 called / dev / very exact against tying                                 names but very very useful I wrote                                 something called signature control which                                 is now almost exactly the same as very                                 exact control so I'm going to be merging                                 the two back together again when i get a                                 chance so this is what a signature for a                                 file looks like again this is i think in                                 the paper if you want to see it first                                 one there is name of the file                                 then we've got well sorry and we have                                 the type of signature that's taken from                                 very execs format it says that's where                                 the digest name appears in very exact so                                 I've just using RSA rdsa is being the                                 signature type here and then you got                                 signature after that and yes that's                                 broken out from the PGP packet format of                                 things so that's what a signature for a                                 file or a script or a library or a                                 configuration file or anything like that                                 looks like in the colonel okay so next                                 thing we're going to do that's probably                                 for those who couldn't see it down at                                 the bottom marilyn is that the machine                                 that I'm running to I'm running to set                                 stuff on that's the colonel in there and                                 so this is actually our slow ting the                                 signatures there I've done it when a                                 signature for the the ED binary this is                                 not because i use head but it's it's in                                 slash bin i wanted something that's nice                                 and easy to show people you're working                                 and things like that remember i said                                 there was lazy evaluation so it says not                                 evaluated yet and this is this is quite                                 important as well because you're                                 probably imagining there's a huge                                 performance impact of digital signatures                                 are checking digest and everything that                                 that the digest only gets checked when                                 the file is opened or read when it's                                 opened in the first place the                                 information is is cached and we'll we'll                                 go as and when needed so yeah slash bin                                 slash ed not evaluated I've got the RSA                                 key down there and yeah you probably                                 can't see it but it tells you when the                                 signature was created down at the bottom                                 ok and so we actually run Edd and please                                 bear with me that's just debugging stuff                                 at the top that I put in there so I edit                                 a file using ad                                 then it tells me flags are direct we                                 talked about that earlier and the                                 signature is valid to notes a valid                                 signature that i wrote the signature                                 because the was the can't see it now but                                 yeah we know it's a valid signature and                                 that the time the signature was created                                 was then and the expiry on the signature                                 is then as well okay so that's we get                                 that out of the colonel by using                                 signature control it does a request into                                 the colonel to get it out the colonel                                 formats it and sends it back up through                                 the / dev / very exact to get that this                                 isn't done in years aligned it's not                                 done in the it's done the colonel in                                 pushed up through probably right and                                 that's what happens when everything                                 works well ok so if we've got all of                                 that there that's fine next slide I                                 decided to go and change the last digit                                 down here from a                                                        that and I saved that in a file called                                 signature bed and it's not because I                                 come from Chelsea it's just I wanted to                                 remember it as a easy name right so what                                 happens when we we try running that come                                 down here and says entry status mismatch                                 now this is just doing it in debugging                                 mode it's just doing it with the the the                                 very exact level at                                                     four levels it can have zero is the one                                 where you're debugging you just want to                                 see whether it's working or not and                                 nothing happens level one is as an IDs                                 so it'll tell you that something's                                 happened I ps                                                          two won't allow you to                                 open the file in that case and level                                 three is called lockdown and it gets a                                 bit more fascist about things says not                                 to do stuff and all this kind of thing                                 don't do it meets all very exact                                 controls away and it's built into the                                 caramel authentication system like that                                 okay I think that's the next signature                                 room is exactly the same yeah and that's                                 that's showing me trying to change the                                 strict level down here you probably                                 can't see this the strict level and                                 unvarying sect to to say all right well                                 I do want to change it can't do it                                 because the caramels up in a secure                                 level when's that when that's in place                                 you can't change the strictness level or                                 very exact so you have to do it early on                                 in the book process very exec has an rcd                                 script and signed exec has exactly the                                 same kind of thing you load up the                                 signature estilo de secure level menu so                                 you know that the strict level then the                                 secure level after that okay so you                                 think I'm getting old I've forgotten                                 about these things or something like                                 that but no no I haven't that's a bit                                 blurry isn't it any ideas for this one                                 you want me to give you a hand one got                                 to go on some people in church singing a                                 hymn thank you second one play what's                                 this one men in black to those men him                                 play men what's this tea and Sean                                 Connery so him play meant a sh t Sean oh                                 you're still here good it does for me ok                                 so let PGP at the current time users                                 openssl victims right so the version                                 that's in the in the repo in the main                                 branch uses openness helping numbs it                                 inherited a coal bank mechanism for                                 reading which is bizarre and arcane and                                 all that kind of stuff and needs to                                 change and is being changed as long and                                 the problems that we have with it like                                 we wanted to enable idea not an easy fix                                 to do there's a problem with I signed                                 the hashes file for an FPS d                                         can't use net PGP to verify it that's                                 all done to a PDP check summing and the                                 way that gpg does its calculation of the                                 digest which is wrong and doesn't                                 conform to the standard but bgp is so g                                 PG is the main implementation so we have                                 to go with their bugs I'm afraid so I                                 talked to bit earlier but the separate                                 branch it's the next generation in that                                 p-gp and we're IM rewriting it from the                                 RFC up I've got the verification done                                 already and that's entry and think that                                 it now uses MPI functionality from lib                                 Tom math and you say no you can't do                                 that nobody else uses it well dropbear                                 uses it and I know certain                                 virtualization manufacturers that used                                 to use drop there is an association                                 there Heimdall uses the Tom math as well                                 what we do is write a thin layer on top                                 of that to give it the API of openssl                                 big nums and that gives us an easy way                                 of getting the functionality without all                                 the openssl stuff we don't get the speed                                 ups true but we also don't have the                                 bring up problems that we have whenever                                 we try and use openssl so this is the                                 new net PDP verify in userland see the                                 libraries it uses just one main one                                 which is that p-gp verify library and if                                 I do our an ldd and a size on those two                                 to find out what they are the big                                 kickers are obviously lipsy and yeah                                 that's about it really big city lipsy                                 press they're fairly small the whole                                 thing is it's a text size for it text                                 size oh yeah yeah because we're using a                                 small program at cause the library text                                 sizes is tiny not really representative                                 of it better looking at the library                                 itself which is there                                                  bad given that lid crypto itself is a                                 bit to make I'm quite happy with that                                 performance impact talked about earlier                                 as with very exact it's negligible we                                 can't actually see any difference in                                 performance running with assigned                                 execution as we can with an ordinary one                                 without it I was going to have a demo up                                 here showing you two systems booting                                 side-by-side and actually running things                                 I'm afraid I I failed in the time                                 department and so I apologize about that                                 so lessons learned probably learned from                                 from doing all of this firstly that                                 mallet kallik realloc free used over and                                 over again in userland especially with                                 the big nom library as well it's from                                 the                                                                    returns pointers to structures as part                                 of the API we've tended to move on a bit                                 since then but openssl hasn't caught up                                 trying to use realloc in the kernel is                                 an interesting experience you really                                 should be doing all the stuff in advance                                 pre computing sizes or maximum size and                                 trying to do that the problem with that                                 is kernel stack sizes are limited                                 sometimes quite each stream depending on                                 the coal that the depth of the call                                 stack within the colonel so what I did                                 find out that I've got to use small                                 steps and I've got lots and lots of them                                 especially as kind of a rule I have with                                 with Carol development and I keep                                 relearning that rule every so often as                                 well so what other things did code                                 signing that's in the commercial world                                 almost everything does it these days                                 especially if you've got PD air and                                 appliance Android iPhone iOS or let them                                 stuff I love using Microsoft authentic                                 code is based in cas and PK is obviously                                 we don't really want to do that kind of                                 thing or I don't want to do that kind of                                 thing because i don't believe that PK is                                 the right vehicle for it especially all                                 the problems that have been around just                                 recently I can only see more of those                                 problems coming in the future as well so                                 in order to take advantage of this what                                 what we're going to do trusted but don't                                 particularly want to go there if any of                                 you have looked at trusted grub and                                 things like that you'll know if it's                                 horrible absolutely horrible you got to                                 tie things down way in advance I                                 actually went them sat down with them                                 Jarryd McNeil one of the                                 yeppers but two years ago and tried to                                 work out how we could do trusted but on                                 x                                                                       the set-top boxes that manufacturers are                                 using out there which will get                                 signatures in firmware for hardware                                 manufacturer from where authors and                                 inventor and decided that on x                                           the three four stage louder process                                 we've got to secure all of those stages                                 in cereal it was going to be a immense                                 amount of work so I don't only want to                                 go there I will have to in the future if                                 we want to actually use this from                                 booting I also sat down with the chief                                 architect at Yahoo and try to work out                                 how we were going to do this for a                                 certain machines we were going to deploy                                 and we sat down for a long time and we                                 came out we didn't have a solution so                                 that's the way in we've got some time if                                 you can bear with me for a minute we'll                                 go into some other stuff on on Krypto                                 and other other things like that                                 everybody all right with that to do so                                 you're going to have to pass this okay                                 I'll give you a clue that's Reed                                 Hastings of Netflix these are some                                 soldiers in Iran at war so we got war                                 read everybody worried                                 you should be thank you okay Krypton is                                 the kind of stuff that's been going on                                 just recently this divided competition                                 to decide another digest algorithm shall                                 three and we've got a check as the as                                 the digest their complete different                                 based on a sponge family I'll come on to                                 that later whatever look at the the                                 resistance to collisions of the sha-                                    will you shall one in most things these                                 days some people gone on to shower                                     some                                                                   but they're thought to be much much more                                 resistant to collisions than we have                                 mainly because of the size but the fact                                 that they're in the same family is also                                 a bit of a concern for some people and                                 this is based on the the md                                            digest as well so they're all the same                                 kind of thing and people are finding                                 better and better ways of making                                 collisions for them collisions are                                 important because if you can collide                                 then you can you can purport to have                                 some data that is not what it actually                                 is and as we use digest down in the bit                                 of it as the basics of signing things                                 that that this is really important okay                                 so we talked about the I thought about                                 the this contest que chaque was a                                 surprise winner of this nobody expected                                 to be main mainly because Bruce Schneier                                 and some of the other people were                                 calling for no no carry to be actually                                 announced when it was announced mr. no I                                 said oh yeah it's a great one sir yeah                                 go figure why is it necessary so some                                 back-of-the-envelope calculations on                                 sha-                                                                   this is Sir over a year all right number                                 of cycles get out of commodity Hardware                                 x                                         your one core eight courseware                                 processors probably state they are four

                                   which gives us tooth and                                                 year from one server that's a big server                                 but it's still a

still getting advances every                                           or so that roughly double what we have                                 at current time so                                                  reckon the worst loss shows no signs of                                 abating at the moment                                                   by                                                                    how many cycles a year are we going to                                 be doing by                                                           that along with Moore's law there we're                                 up to                                                                 have a look at sha Wan collisions a                                 block of a shower and

so every years thank you we                                 talked about them earlier so in                                          to

going to cost if we were going                                 to do this in hardware so amazon charges                                 four cents an hour us cents which is

                this is still nine years off on you                                 still be able to do it for forty-three                                 thousand US dollars now that's quite                                 within the reach of lots of people                                 university departments doing that as                                 research

involved in                                 breaking sha-                                                       we're good for another few years with it                                 depends what

becoming more of a necessity now                                 and so we need to start looking at our                                 we're going to implement this now we're                                 going to bring it in to our libraries                                 and our applications it's a spanish                                 function                                 that means that it kind of sponges up                                 the the input and puts out that the                                 output to me that seems like a kind of a                                 marketing term but it's the way that                                 we've been using to refer to it and all                                 the literature as well there is a                                 reference implementation I'm not sure                                 how good it is i'm about to have a look                                 at it and so we'll see what it super                                 looks like but it's a completely                                 different family of hashes so everybody                                 is quite excited about this kind of                                 thing what size key should i be using                                 well depends what you're doing fairly                                 obvious for RSA DNS SEC is using two key                                 bits that's way overkill because the                                 attacks that are going to go on and this                                 kind of thing are well it's not the                                 attacks it's more of the the overhead                                 that's used to calculate signatures all                                 the time at                                                            cycles lots of churn for absolutely no                                 gain at the same time                                                   these days and it's getting easier to                                 crack and so we'll move on from there                                 new kid on the block elliptical curve                                 DSA the openssh                                                         it's encoded in RFC                                                     a sucker three curves there openssh it's                                 just implemented the ones that are                                 required not all of the ones that are in                                 the RFC there's diffie-hellman and                                 there's DSA based on elliptical curve                                 and the reason for using elliptical                                 curve is that the keys are much smaller                                 and it happens much quicker than both                                 the essay and RSA and we think for about                                 the same level security so ecdsa is                                 about quarter the size the keys of the                                 essay and DSA is around about half the                                 size for the equivalent level of                                 security as RSA RSA is the old kid on                                 the block if you can get such a thing                                 it's the kind of gold standard as far as                                 these things are concerned and with that                                 I am done any questions yay even static                                 he's going to save best attack possible                                 and I expect that it's going to bring                                 down the complexity much lower because                                 people are going to find other stuff in                                 Batoche it's basically broken now yeah                                 is a good point i didn't mention any of                                 the advances that people are having in                                 and actually finding new ways to attack                                 the collision resistance of shower                                 answered yes thank you very much i                                 completely agree you mentioned that the                                 secretary control there was a level that                                 you could set and it was that it's                                 obviously system overall would it make                                 any sense to have this per file system                                 or even profile and what did that be                                 easy to implement it would make sense or                                 not today it's an interesting thought                                 the way it's done at the moment is not                                 by file system but yes I can see that                                 that you might want certain things on                                 the root file system which are much more                                 protected than things on my home                                 directory exams like I don't really care                                 anybody looks at that nothing I think                                 this either had seen to yeah I think                                 that's a good idea it's not implemented                                 that way at the moment although there is                                 a mount point in there if you look at                                 the very easy eight control output so it                                 may well be possible to add I should                                 thank you I'll have a chat to Brett                                 about that and see what see what happens                                 anymore well thank you very much                                 you
