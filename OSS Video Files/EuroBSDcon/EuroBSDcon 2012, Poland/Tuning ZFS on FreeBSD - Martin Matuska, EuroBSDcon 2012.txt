	                              okay my name is Martin Matuschka and I                               would like to welcome you to my talk                               Mike to talk today will be about tuning                               CFS on FreeBSD let's have a very short                               overview about what we are going to talk                               about today so in the beginning I will                               give you a very short quote about what                               is this all about then I will give you                               some general tuning tips very basic ones                                then application to any tips for several                                types of applications and going on with                                ZFS caches that's that's the more                                complicated part because there you have                                to also count and and calculate stuff                                and at the very last I will show you                                statistics tools I'm using part of them                                are written by me part of them just                                modified that can give you measurement                                and evaluation data to make decisions                                how to tune your ZFS installation so                                let's go on as you know ZFS is the last                                word in file systems software letters                                via physics fsy fastened at the very                                event ZFS at least if you have three                                letters and the last two ones are FS                                it's probably the last word yes so it is                                a modern                                                                open source originally developed by Sun                                Microsystems and it is utilizing the                                copy-on-write model                                this presentation will tell us answers                                to two questions first of these question                                is how can we do DFS and                                the second question is when should the                                FSB tuned at all so if we need that or                                if it's not necessary so I'll start with                                this help my ZFS is slow ok ZFS is slow                                first of all define slow I mean what                                does it mean slow first you have to tell                                what does it mean to be slow                                what are you comparing to are you                                comparing to the very same system                                yesterday yes it is running for                                         yesterday it was quick today you have                                performance problems or you are                                comparing to a completely different file                                system on the same machine or you are                                comparing the fastest and on a                                completely different machine with                                completely different hardware and if you                                are doing that then it's scientifically                                irrelevant decisions because that can be                                based on these assumptions good well as                                I say it depends on many factors                                workloads data access what data                                structures to have on your system                                we have many files do have few files are                                your files big RFR small in ZFS we                                always have this magic trade-off of data                                consistency and features against speed                                so we have stuff like ZFS checksums and                                and and other other features that cost                                processing time and make your system                                slower than if you are using a file                                system that doesn't use this these                                features another point is it might                                happen that auto-tuning may not be your                                case so if you have special not standard                                environments where you are for example                                having a heavy utilized web server with                                                                                                      the standard settings are not optimal                                for your installation ok the first thing                                I want to say is always think twice                                about what you do and what you said I                                have here quotes                                two blocks on the Internet first is a                                block by by some guy who writes about                                speeding up CFS on FreeBSD and among                                other other things he has here disable                                unwanted features so I'm really quoting                                him this is what's on the block and he                                says you know if you do not need                                checksum disable them and on his block                                also if you look at his optimisation                                strings there is I don't think checks                                check sums for fire therefore data for                                so ZFS disable checksum Honda on the                                whole system and he is using a mirror                                already dataset yeah wonderful                                ok another block that some next Center                                also for tuning on an accent a system                                that says a note on disabling ZFS                                checksum don't so that there are two                                different opinions if you want to hear                                what what's my opinion about this yes if                                I decide we'll check some some ZFS then                                it looks probably like this and yeah you                                know that's like shuffling my own own                                 grave because checksum is one of the one                                 of the very important features that that                                 helps you keep your data integrity in                                 ZFS so each block of data is being                                 checked sound and these check sums are                                 compared always every time you access                                 this data so if something changes on                                 your disk without without a knowledge of                                 the system the system is aware of this                                 another point if you have raid-z or                                 mirror installations you have the                                 self-healing feed feature that means                                 that if the data gets corrupted on one                                 disk                                 the system automatically replaces the                                 corrupted data with data that matches                                 the checksum from the from the other                                 device that with a section of general                                 tuning tips these are really very basic                                 ones so nothing I think advanced very                                 easy to perform it will be about system                                 memory access time data set compression                                 about the dead application and ZFS send                                 and receive in one of these blocks I                                 have mentioned they got this guy who                                 recommends disabling checksums he also                                 recommends don't use rate see use just                                 mirrors because it's faster you know it                                 depends what you want if you want a lot                                 of space you neither HC because with a                                 mirror you always have the half of the                                 half the space of your of your setup and                                 even in CFS I have had setups where I                                 have a four-way mirror that means I have                                 just four discs running as one disc just                                 of the purpose of speed so that so that                                 the access times get lower of all these                                 four drives because SATA drives are                                 maybe big today but they are still not                                 fast I mean compared to again yes even                                 even the SAS drives have at high so I                                 guess                                                              faster than SATA drives but it's not as                                 it is not as fast as the bleeding-edge                                 SSDs so let's start with random access                                 memory ZFS is RAM eater so the caches                                 and other parts of the filesystem need                                 random access memory so in freebsd we                                 have a recommended minimum of one                                 gigabyte but that's really for for some                                 kind of a really really small home                                 server that's doing nothing that is                                 usable if you if you need serious work                                 you need at least                                                  recommend using                                                       memory and from this from this memory                                 will look later how much of this memory                                 is used for the ZFS caches so access                                 time that's a topic about UNIX systems I                                 have heard for a long long time the                                 problem of excess time is that every                                 time a files is accessed on a UNIX file                                 system with in able to access time is                                 that the data is stored that the                                 timestamp is updated I mean on normal                                 systems non ZFS systems let's call them                                 like this it might not be such an issue                                 but on ZFS let's say you have snapped                                 and you have lots of snapshots I mean                                 that now every time you access it this                                 this data has to be updated compared to                                 these snapshots so many people ask                                 themselves why I'm are wise myspace                                 growing I did not write one single file                                 in my system but I have                                             files which are accessed daily and I'm                                 doing barely snapshots and my snapshots                                 have like hundreds of megabytes why is                                 that and that's just and what is this                                 okay so so that's just because because                                 of this excess time feature the excess                                 time gets updated and the snapshots                                 remember all changes in data and                                 metadata so the excess time change is                                 stored in the snapshot and in the next                                 snapshot again new access time of the                                 latest one before the snapshot based on                                 and so on                                 so your Snapseed snapshots take space                                 and the space usage might really grow if                                 you have lots of lots of small files                                 which are accessed frequently so data                                 set compression well that's a that's a                                 mixed story the origin of target of data                                 set compression the goal is to save                                 space that means that you compress your                                 data and you they occupy less space on                                 your D Drive then then the part number                                 that's written in the data so the size                                 of the data it depends how compressible                                 this data is and it depends on what                                 which algorithm you choose currently                                 only two algorithms are available its LC                                 at the end                                 LT j p and g c LC j b compresses less                                 gzip complains is more but is the CPU                                 usage LC jb uses much less CPU than GC                                 passage is it much much more of course                                 if you have a very slow device and you                                 are reading compressed data your                                 relative data through throughput                                 increases I recommend using compression                                 primarily for claim archiving purposes                                 so for example these fit locks so you                                 just don't compress your locks with busy                                 you just disable in FreeBSD                                 I have a separate data set set gzip ZFS                                 compression of the undies data set and                                 the data is on the fly is compressed on                                 the flyest as the logs are written there                                 is a new compression algorithm in the                                 works at illumos that is called lz                                      it should be device as fast as lcj be                                 and it should consume even less CPU                                 power much less than lzj be so i'm                                 interesting how it how this how this how                                 this is going to work out so that                                 application ok if you think ZFS needs a                                 lot of RAM and if you are using the                                 application you need like ^                                      something like that well it depends on                                 how how many blocks are you using                                 because the duplication uses uses a kind                                 of hash table where or the or the                                 duplicate block data is stored and you                                 have good performance when these hash                                 table fits into your memory if your                                 memory is larger it has to be split and                                 part of the calculations have to be I                                 have to be out outsource and it gets                                 really really slow there is a magical                                 command to the gdb called zdb - - s and                                 it does kind of a simulation how much                                 space would you gain if your system                                 would be the duplicated so it it's just                                 kind of a dry run where where the data                                 predication isn't enabled isn't really                                 enabled you are the data isn't stored                                 once but you gather you get a print of a                                 table and also the size of the table how                                 much space you will gain and how big                                 this table will be if you are already                                 having the duplication then you can                                 check the data with set D B - D or Minos                                 dd that gives us detailed detailed                                 information about how the data                                 application structure works and                                 generally it's recommended that it                                 should be at least a factor of                                          don't have a factor of                                                  not not really useful factor of                                         that you save half of the amount of the                                 data that's stored on our drive ok ZFS                                 send and receive yes you might know ZFS                                 is able to send data sets in a stream                                 and you can store them in a file or                                 directly receive these systems on                                 another system this method of direct                                 receiver on another system is used very                                 commonly many people use this for                                 example piping through SSH or other                                 security connections and the problem is                                 the buffering that's built in ZFS is not                                 optimal for for this kind of data                                 transfer so I recommend using some kind                                 of meat                                 buffering solution we have in our ports                                 one of these called mist buffer and the                                 better one is Miss M buffer which is                                 network capable so you can set up a                                 buffer on one side on another side and                                 just piped through this many buffer the                                 data you define the amount of memory                                 that's allocated to an buffer and the                                 speed gains might be really big because                                 the the speed the data is read from from                                 the drives from the devices is not                                 constant so you have parts there are                                 large files you are reading quickly you                                 have parts there are many more small                                 smaller files you need more seek time                                 and it takes more time and sometimes the                                 reading is faster than your network                                 connection sometimes the reading is                                 slower so this buffer actually based                                 make such a wage between these between                                 these two situations and you get a more                                 constant speed and all together it's                                 faster because the system has less                                 waiting time for the connection or for                                 the data                                 so application tuning tips I'm we are                                 going to look how to optimize for the                                 following application I will show some                                 settings for the web servers some                                 settings for database servers and some                                 settings for file servers so before you                                 go to the hard core optimization that                                 means when nothing else helps that's                                 that stuff possibility how this could be                                 done maybe in the past times many                                 machines have been optimized this way                                 but today it was little differently so                                 let's take a look at web servers as of                                 the current ZFS implementation we have                                 we have a problem with this because if                                 you are using the same file call the                                 data is actually cost cached advice                                 first in the freebsd inactive memory and                                 second in the ZFS cache so you have like                                 twice the data in your cache and that is                                 very bad because you're losing your                                 memory in a quick way these                                           current implementation is recommended to                                 just disable signed file because it's                                 directly served from the ZFS cache so                                 you don't don't have to don't have to                                 use the freebsd fastest freebsd standard                                 caching system in this case these                                 discounts also for the a map in a posh                                 so if you apply these two settings you                                 will notice on your system then you have                                 much more free round memory and the                                 speed will be about the same in engines                                 you just disable same file with same                                 file off and in light httpd you set                                 right vs the network back-end I have                                 personal experiences design can tell you                                 that it makes a difference                                 I have administered systems that had                                 like                                                                gigabytes of RAM and when I have changed                                 these settings I look oh I have certain                                 gigabyte more freedom nice                                 okay servers well many people say don't                                 run database servers from ZFS is                                 generally always slower as the other                                 file systems it might be true at least                                 at least for UF s for example PostgreSQL                                 is a lot faster from you FS than than                                 from ZFS at least on FreeBSD what what                                 is recommended is to change the default                                 record size because databases store the                                 data in in chunks consistent chunks and                                 these chunks in Postgres Cobb Ivar by                                 standard eight eight kilobytes so if you                                 set the record size to eight kilobytes                                 you have a more effective data set then                                 if you leave the default                                                                                                                        allocation is better if you if you put                                 it down to                                                       squirrel form ie some storage it's                                     kilobyte for innodb storage it's                                    kilobytes I personally use the                                   kilobyte for my MySQL installations so                                 Universal setting well file service I                                 have some general tips first of them is                                 disable access time if you don't need it                                 keep the number of snapshots low if you                                 have quite a lot of snapshots                                 then it gets again slower because of                                 because of the date weight the data is                                 stored because the the day time for our                                 server is taught relatively in the                                 snapshots that means each snapshot the                                 remembers changes from the last snapshot                                 and as of the experience we have if you                                 have really a lot of snapshots many                                 internal ZFS operations take longer                                 because they have to traverse all the                                 snapshots so so these internal                                 operations                                 slow down other other data activity on                                 your system if you want to use the                                 duplication only if you are sure that                                 you have enough                                 random access memory to do this                                 otherwise you have again a slowdown on                                 your system for heavy Breitbart loads                                 like business scale it's recommended to                                 move the CFS intent locked to separate                                 SSD drives normally the CFS interlock is                                 stored on a small part of your existing                                 pool of your existing devices and it's                                 it's something similar to the to the                                 journal it's not not the same but the                                 functionality is very similar to the                                 journal engineering for our systems and                                 if you put it on as another drive or on                                 fastest s                                                                load gets gets faster optionally you can                                 disable the ZFS intent lock for                                 individual data sets so it's it's                                 configurable but again beware the                                 consequence is you are losing the data                                 the integrity you know on a possible                                 system shutdown or panic so we are now                                 going to the more scientific part of my                                 talk and that's tuning of cache and                                 preferred settings so I'm going to talk                                 about adaptive replacement cache arts                                 that's the key point of ZFS the key                                 cache then we have the level                                       adaptive replacement cache it's not it's                                 most systems are not using this feature                                 but again if you are deploying larger                                 systems for example with heavy read                                 workloads it's very useful because it                                 increases your it's similar to increase                                 in RAM but you just have more of these                                 of this memory on your SSD drives then                                 we have the ZFS interlock that's also                                 also measured and monitored we have a                                 feature that's called final level                                 prefetch or Z fetch in ZFS then we have                                 a device level prefetching vida prefetch                                 then I will show you the statistics                                 tools I'm using so the adaptive                                 replacement cache it resides in the                                 system right memory it's the major                                 speed-up of ZFS so if you disable Ark                                 you will see everything gets really slow                                 in the                                 the size of the arc is auto-tuned let's                                 take a look at the default values so if                                 we look at them we have we have here the                                 maximum size of your error see it's                                 actually physical around less one                                 gigabyte so if you have like                                    gigabytes of RAM then                                                  want as a max maximum value for for arc                                 as we can see here or half of my half of                                 all memory so if you have only one                                 gigabyte of memory you cannot allocate                                 one minutes one gigabyte for us because                                 you have no memory for anything else so                                 only half of the memory is allocated to                                 arc again we have a minimum and the                                 minimum value is                                                         have something called metadata limit                                 your arc memory is divided into two                                 parts one is arc for data and other is                                 for metadata metadata is data about data                                 so there are stored information about                                 about the files                                 inodes and stuff like this and there are                                 situations where you heat limit of this                                 memory so you take a look you see your                                 other values look good I mean you have                                 enough RAM there is still free arc but                                 their system is slow because because                                 this part of the arc memory gets filled                                 up and it has to be replaced so so the                                 data still there are still a lot of                                 reads on your own or drives and you                                 still have a lot of free art memory in                                 total so you're asking yourself how does                                 this happen then we have a minimum and                                 that's the standard for arc is                                        the maximum of the maximum so if we have                                 again it's a                                                           then from this metadata limit we cut it                                 to                                                                     arc arc when your system is running this                                 arc is auto-tuned it cooperates with the                                 vm memory pressure in freebsd so if arc                                 needs more memory it allocates more                                 worried about this all of this is kinda                                 memory of course and if if other parts                                 of the system need this memory then it's                                 again freed but only up to the minimum                                 so it actually moves between the minimum                                 and the maximum and on on a busy system                                 it will be always close to the maximum                                 or some kind of equilibrium chosen                                 between the VM pressure and the memory                                 Ark is ready to release I was having                                 these in these statistics those so first                                 of all how can we tune this Ark you can                                 art can be disabled on a data set level                                 that means you can tell you can say                                 these data set do not use Ark and you                                 can say this data set use only Ark for                                 metadata there are two options you can                                 you can set again it might be useful if                                 you are short of memory on or if you                                 really explicitly need to reserve your                                 art for only a specific group of data                                 sets the maximum can be limited to                                 reserve memory for other tasks many                                 people do this and it might be useful on                                 on several types of systems for example                                 if you are using tmpfs and you want this                                 memory allocated to MP FS to be always                                 there you don't want the FS to grow it's                                 out to be Ark memory too big you can                                 just cut the maximum and and safe                                 safeties memory for other purposes as I                                 said again increasing this meta limit                                 might be useful if you have a lot of                                 metadata that means for example lots of                                 files if you have earlier                                            files in our case increasing this value                                 made a big change on how the system                                 performs okay l two arks that's the                                 level to work some facts about it it's                                 designed to run on fast block devices                                 SSD it helps primarily on read intensive                                 workloads so if you are deploying a                                 Samba server in some in a company where                                 you have like                                                    workload l                                                 thing for you but if you are deploying a                                 web server that has that works like                                 bright ones read many then SSD is a very                                 very practical and we have done this                                 with about                                                             and this was used very efficiently so we                                 have been very happy with it                                 l                                                                      same arc for all pools on your system so                                 all ports on your system are sharing the                                 same memory region for l                                              these SSD devices or device groups you                                 can also make a mirror is devoted to one                                 special pool that means you can have                                 several devices from several pools and                                 you are just limiting this to to these                                 pools and like arc on this pool you can                                 make pair data set settings that only                                 this data set is using the memory and                                 other data sets are not using the                                 secondary level cache okay how to tune                                 this memory first first of all by                                 default the prefetch for l                                          disabled and for us this was very                                 hurting hurting us so we had to change                                 it to on again the setting is v FS DFS                                 out to arc no prefetch is a loader                                 conversating and if you are doing                                 streaming servers like streaming large                                 files or video files then I recommend                                 turning this on because it's it's a it's                                 a huge performance gain and the l                                      doesn't work really well if it's not if                                 it's not set there is a period called                                 turbo warm-up phase what is this                                 because SSD drives cannot be rewritten                                 forever they are they are getting lost                                 the engineers of San had thought to just                                 lower the speed at which the l                                         written on the drives and there are two                                 phases there is the standard writing                                 phase dist of right max and there is a                                 turbo phase it's called right                                 by standard they have set these settings                                 to                                                               standard situation only                                                 second can be written to the l                                          that this may be a bottleneck on your                                 system and in this tool buffets they                                 have set in again to                                                   the beginning of the system this this                                 warm-up phase actually happens to the                                 first moment where memory is evicted                                 from at l                                                              memory has not been evicted                                 it's the turbo face and when the first                                 memory gets evicted we have to standard                                 situation so in this turbo phase these                                 two values again loader conf settings                                 are added so this is                                               standards this is a right of                                    megabytes per seconds which is a busy                                 one might be off for two days the SSD is                                 that slow so I recommend setting these                                 to higher Wireless are higher values at                                 least                                                                 faster but again the idea of this was to                                 prevent these SSDs to Train quickly but                                 the technology of ss this is improving                                 every year so as of today this                                     megabytes settings correspond to the                                 situation of like four years ago                                 so two SSDs have developed since then so                                 I recommend setting higher values so ZFS                                 in turn lock its current is the data                                 consistency your own F sync calls                                 replaced arranged transactions in case                                 of a panic or a power failure of the                                 system and in general uses the small                                 storage space on the pool as I already                                 told and to speed up writes it can be                                 placed on a separate device as you can                                 see on this line there is a pair data                                 set setting you can set sync to stand                                 out always or disabled that's the pair                                 data set synchronicity if you set to                                 disabled then it's it's not used at all                                 the the in the intern lock that means                                 you have no data integrity and                                 I personally don't use this but some                                 some users recommended an IBM situation                                 for some parts of the drives where this                                 might be useful setting these two always                                 means that on every F seen data gets not                                 written to the log but to the disk                                 always so it gets to the rock end to the                                 disk and that's very slow so this is                                 really for hard core data consistency                                 applications where you really need it to                                 be written not just in the lock in the                                 system but exactly already in place when                                 the when the F sinkhole returns the                                 standard setting is sufficient for for                                 most people I'm using only the standard                                 setting on my systems so file level                                 prefetching file level prefetch analyze                                 this read patterns of files it tries to                                 predict next street and the goal is to                                 read to reduce application response                                 times there is a lot to know able to                                 enable on and disable Z fetch many                                 people recommend disabling it I will                                 show you later in my statistics tools                                 you can measure how efficient is the                                 fetch on your systems and according to                                 this data you can make the decision to                                 disable it or not to disable it we have                                 deepest level prefetch device level                                 prefetch is it's used to then when you                                 read small chunks from a device the                                 intention of this is actually for slow                                 devices that have a bad access time that                                 means if you read just a small chunk                                 device level Prevage actually reads from                                 this device more data specified in                                 Indies in this variable so this was this                                 has this was usually set to                                              it's a static allocated kernel memory at                                 boot and when you set this memory then                                 then breathing like for cube idols there                                 is also a there is also at threshold                                 that can be also set but that's a bite                                 shift value value and when when the                                 reads are under these thresholds then                                 like ten megabytes are read from the                                 data instead of just like four kilobytes                                 the idea is that there are less seeks on                                 the drive and you have more more data                                 available on this on this one one read                                 the problem was people have been using                                 CFS for appliances and these appliances                                 have had a lot of drives and and if you                                 have like                                                                big appliance you multiply this with ten                                 megabytes you are just losing this                                 memory already at the beginning because                                 it statically allocated a they cannot be                                 used for anything else and that might be                                 quite a large amount for a big number of                                 drives on a small system there is no                                 real reason to disable it but it has                                 been disabled by the bit by default so                                 again what you can do you can try to                                 enable it and use the statistical                                 measurement tools to take a look how                                 effective how efficient is it on your                                 system so the statistical statistical                                 data in ZFS is provided by CCT on ops                                 it's called the it's actually by poverty                                 I could the reject the case that                                 framework has imported it and this case                                 that framework gives you a lot of                                 counters lot of statistical data a lot                                 of values this VFS ZFS are our ethical                                 values and these are collected values so                                 this is the sister current state how                                 much is what and here are here are                                 collectors this data can help you make                                 tuning decisions and this is quite                                 important because just during because                                 somebody else says yes this might be                                 good that's no scientific way to do                                 things and it is much better if we make                                 some measurements I will show you two                                 tools first of them is called DFS stats                                 and the second one is called ZFS moon                                 both tools are available in ports and                                 the Sisu teals C's utils ZFS debt                                 so ZFS debts is based on been recruits                                 our summary PL for salaries and includes                                 model modifications by Jason G haven't                                 tell and myself it gives you an overview                                 about how your systems look like looks                                 like now and what happened since the                                 system boot it also has several common                                 line flags if you use the minus H flag                                 you have a help that shows you what is                                 possible or if you run it without the                                 arguments and it shows you the structure                                 of your memories and how field they are                                 here is an sample output of this so here                                 we have the our exercise yeah here we                                 can see it's                                              it's the target size we have the minimum                                 size it's                                                              gigabytes in this case on this system                                 the Ark memory was limited the system                                 had a total of                                                        have limited the ark to                                                 RAM as we can see the arc is used up to                                                                                                       boot time so it's a collected value and                                 there you can see it's it's                                            have a                                                                  also demand and prefetch efficiencies                                 then we have the L to Ark breakdown and                                 again we have a hit ratio of                                                                                                                   want to collect if you want to calculate                                 your total efficiency you have to take                                 this value that's the miss ratio of the                                 arc and this this valuation actually                                 split here in L so so from this                                         are read from the L to from the level to                                 memory and these                                                     from the drives so so it's probably                                 about six parts and so your total                                 efficiency is about                                                    in the system this is an example output                                 of ZF                                 starts it's very useful to give you like                                 a statistical or aesthetic overview of                                 your current system but people are more                                 interested on what is going on now that                                 means not what this since the system was                                 booted because like for example the                                 first week there was no utilization and                                 now in the last week we have a lot of X                                 data access and dryers so I have a                                 second utility that's called ZFS Mon                                 that post ZFS counter counters in real                                 time and analyzes this data and gives                                 you real time absolute and relative                                 values again there are again there are                                 lots of flags and my inspiration for                                 this tool was varnish that from the                                 varnish project project most of you                                 maybe in all this or many of you so the                                 output is exactly like varnish that's                                 output it looks like this so we but this                                 is the extended version I mean you can                                 you can just have a very very low output                                 adjust that shows you just the                                 efficiencies there are a lot of flex you                                 can change this you can even tell the                                 system that collect the data for                                     seconds and then just output output the                                 statistics so here we can see we see                                 like in varnish that that means this is                                 statistics for the last second that                                 means how does this what that what did                                 the system do in the last second then we                                 have an average for the last                                            for the                                                                  since the since the comment was running                                 we have this for absolute values that's                                 here that that's really how many hits                                 have been counted and here we have                                 relative values that means what is the                                 efficiency percentage compared for                                 example hits against misses and so on so                                 here we have in the ten seconds it was                                                                                                        total it was about                                                   minutes running time                                             oh you actually do tuning after your                                 undies you run this before any tuning                                 yes what this example is from the same                                 system as before that means you have an                                 arc limitation the l                                               enabled for example from from this setup                                 we might ask your sort a question is the                                 fetch that means file view prefetch                                 useful for me so we take a look at mean                                 at least in the last                                                   here an efficiency of ninety two point                                 ninety two percent that that's quite                                 nice I mean I would use if I buy with                                 this with this efficiency for l                                         is quite a lot lower we have here                                       usually never manage very high offences                                 without to work but on my systems I have                                 been happy with it's over                                            long run for l                                                        kids not okay for art you need a higher                                 higher efficiency like here                                             this is about the statistic tools and                                 now I'm open to questions so I let this                                 open if anyone has questions I would                                 like to answer them it's a comment back                                 when son was developing his EFS they                                 found bad hardware bad memory bad disk                                 controller firmware all with the                                 checksums in VMs so disabling the                                 checksum in VMS he should really                                 question the veracity of anybody who                                 makes that advice I mean it's it's a big                                 part at checksum it's a big part of what                                 ZFS is that's why I showed this example                                 as a bad example that means he puts this                                 on the block there are lots of comments                                 from a lot of people but the idea of                                 this was just don't trust anybody in any                                 block you find on the internet because                                 many people who get the Internet that                                 what's written                                 you know this holy so that's that's not                                 that's not the point it should look like                                 yeah                                 other questions yes                                 did you both all the servers are full                                 the FSR that means their boot from ZFS                                 they ran these data from ZFS and so on                                 so there is really only ZFS filesystem                                 which of the two nobles are is it                                 possible to tune on running system and                                 which require a reboot there is a very                                 low number of tuner bus that is the                                 dista Bellona on the running system one                                 of the two numbers I didn't mention that                                 that that can be changed is the                                 threshold for the txg writing time that                                 can be used on write write workloads                                 it's the auto tuning of this available                                 is quite good there are some cases where                                 you want to set this fixed value that                                 means that after after the th tree                                 accumulates a specific amount of memory                                 it is written to the drive in the past                                 this was some some how he badly                                 implemented so we have been heavily                                 using this this tuning this tuning                                 setting because maybe many of you in the                                 past experience the FS like pulsing                                 right that means your system is running                                 and now it is writing for for like five                                 seconds then again nothing happens and                                 then it's writing for five seconds this                                 was happening as the FS and this tunable                                 was able to change this behavior but in                                 the recent versions this has been fixed                                 in the internals so that doesn't really                                 happen anymore at least on FreeBSD but                                 there are a very few and mostly mostly                                 with from from sis detail you can                                 actually loop or in the in the header                                 files in the source files you can take a                                 look exactly which ones our our                                 configure but it's a very very low                                 number most of them are hard-coded                                 memory sizes and you can change you can                                 make changes to this kernel memory on on                                 the running system because it's not safe                                 not the questions                                 I have a system that has a lot of very                                 small files and I noticed that the meta                                 limit is exceeded like the meta limit I                                 have a                                                                   gigabytes                                 yes but currently I'm using                                              method cache there something I can do                                 that lead more arc or you want more                                 metadata cache or less yes you have here                                 the meta data usage is the demand and                                 the prefetch metadata and and and here                                 her here as we can see it's poor yeah                                 the efficiency values are really poor so                                 so from this system I will tell it is                                 full and I need to increase the limit                                 but again you have to reboot the system                                 to make this a right but in my system I                                 you have already changed it you know I                                 didn't change the limit but the amount                                 it using is three times the limit the                                 limit is not actually happening this                                 might be a bug in the ZFS implementation                                 might be I'm not experiencing this but I                                 have read in the forums that some people                                 do experience this so how much is their                                 total memory yes                                                        of files you are serving                                                 even less than we have been doing but we                                 have never experienced this so it was                                 never higher than the dental limit                                 number but I know and wreak upon was                                 also looking at this AVG in freebsd and                                 he found there some some some settings                                 that have been bad so it was really                                 possible to to allocate more memory than                                 this limit because some calculations had                                 I guess off by one but error or                                 something like that's in in our case you                                 have mentioned that some defaults are                                 working sort of like the writing speed                                 to a CDs yes do plan to change them in                                 freebsd do plan to shift these defaults                                 to more modern values to change these                                 defaults our general policy at lease of                                 now is to follow the vendor because the                                 more changes we make the more different                                 we are                                 the more problems we have porting new                                 changes from from yobbos so currently we                                 didn't have we didn't make any decision                                 to change these values so it is left up                                 to the user but we should probably                                 document this somewhere at least on the                                 wiki's that this is also important for                                 the auto cache again these effects only                                 the speed so how much how long does it                                 take for you to make this cache fool for                                 example you can say I want it to be                                 quickly full but then I want to save the                                 drives so you could just increase this                                 value for the form for the turbo and                                 when the cache is full then it then the                                 next writes are really on on a slow                                 basis as a maximum the problem is the                                 most users will not get to that details                                 and as well it depends if you are making                                 a setup for for a huge company serving                                 many web servers many clients were very                                 lots of like hundred thousands or                                 millions of dollars our fluff are                                 flowing I I would expect from from a                                 contractor or somebody who sets up my                                 service that they also look at details                                 like this I would expect this from my                                 from from my contractors or from my very                                 own department because if it's an it's a                                 if it's not important and not important                                 machine that simply don't care I mean                                 that it makes no sense because you just                                 have to invest money and you never get                                 it back but on these heavy utilize                                 systems every percent of of speed you                                 get has a very positive effect on your                                 revenues so it's just a business view at                                 least at least off of me the question                                 says                                 drives or otherwise any hardware                                 recommendations based on your experience                                 we have been usually using really only                                 SATA and SAS arrays in some of our                                 systems we have been even avoiding the                                 raid-z combination so we have really had                                 raid                                                                   array we have set up ZFS just because of                                 the caching features but many a player                                 appliances are sold with this Vista                                 setup the question is if your system is                                 an appliance and at the very same time                                 web server and other other services if                                 this mix is efficient for you or not but                                 from from the hardware if you have a big                                 bunch of so a jbod of a lot of SATA                                 drives that is fully sufficient the                                 problem in freebsd admits at current is                                 that we have we are missing this fault                                 daemon seen lee has been working on this                                 is called ZFS d the idea is that there                                 is some kind of a message framework that                                 if a drive fails you could noticed about                                 this in freebsd from the the ZFS                                 communicates somehow that there is some                                 demand that really monitors this                                 installer is you have to you have to SMS                                 the service management framework that                                 really informs you about every event                                 that happens in in freebsd windowed                                 don't have this for CFS but i guess                                 other parts of the system might made                                 might also miss this feature it could be                                 somehow standardized other questions                                 what do you want to benchmark thank you                                 just speed megabytes per second let's                                 say                                                                       I like only benchmark or other other                                  benchmarking tools that are available I                                  mean it's the very same benchmarking                                  like like others I don't know if special                                  benchmarking tool retail for ZFS that                                  you know tweaks it makes better data for                                  ZFS that doesn't make sense okay so I'm                                  talking here mostly about tuning tools                                  and collecting statistics what to what                                  to set and where thank you for the                                  question okay thank you                                  you
