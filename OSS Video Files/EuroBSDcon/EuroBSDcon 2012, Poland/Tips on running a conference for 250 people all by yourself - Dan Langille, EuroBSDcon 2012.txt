	                              okay I think I'm ready first rule of                               running a conference start to talk on                               time                               how many of you been to one of my                               conferences before okay so that's about                               a quarter don't worry about taking notes                               eventually I'll put the slides up all of                               that Twitter account and i'll let you                               know where they are I've been running                                conferences since about                                               time period I've run about                                   conferences to make matters difficult                                for myself I decided to start a                                conference never having run one of my                                own before I can't imagine anyone that's                                done that or not done that actually                                because everyone who runs a conference                                for the first time is doing it for the                                first time to make it more difficult for                                myself in                                                            country and start start writing the                                conference remotely it's not actually a                                lot much harder to run it remotely than                                it is to run locally the two conferences                                that I'm best known for RBS you can and                                PG con there's a couple of other                                conferences that I've runway my distant                                past and they're not really relevant                                anymore that it's an open source weekend                                I didn't run those all on my own but um                                they gave me an insight on how to run a                                conference oh yeah you may think you're                                running the conference all in your own                                but you're not when I say I'm running it                                on my own I'm lying who's volunteered                                s'alright you knew that you knew that oh                                yeah there's volunteers there's                                suppliers there's caterers and the main                                thing for the volunteers as they get                                involved very close to the day yep                                anyone who's been to BST canon has been                                standing around in the lobby at the                                inappropriate time meaning the beginning                                of the day you'll find that I walk up to                                you and say here come with me please                                carry this box that's how I get a lot of                                the volunteers                                but the thing to remember is that you is                                conference organizer you're the one that                                actually does all the work you're the                                one that makes the things happen other                                people don't necessarily know what needs                                to be done but you do and you tell them                                to do it I this is a complicated bit if                                you're in this talk the chances are your                                novice you'd never run a conference                                before that's who I'm aiming this talk                                out I'm not aiming it at people who have                                already run a conference because clearly                                you know how to run a conference so this                                talk isn't set up to be a criticism of                                people who are already running                                conferences it's to give you an insight                                into what I know about running                                conferences with the proviso that                                someone once told me then you run a good                                conference I said well I really don't                                know what I'm doing that's not sarcasm I                                had no idea what it was to do right when                                it comes to running a conference but                                I've come up with a few key points one                                you got to be highly organized so that                                rules most of you out you've got to be                                the type of person that's walking along                                you see trash in the street and you want                                to pick it up the type of person that                                you walk into a shopping center and you                                see a mat in front of the the door that                                has a ripple in it and you want to                                straighten it out so no one trips on it                                you're the type of person that sees a                                typo on a web page and you email the                                owner of the webpage to tell them about                                it you're the type of person that sees a                                great file system in a complex operating                                system decides to port it to your own                                operating system you see a situation you                                want to improve it that's the type of                                person that that works well as a                                conference organizer you've got a strong                                drive to complete tasks because believe                                me there's a lot of tasks to do as part                                of a conference organizer you can easily                                decide between right and wrong you don't                                have to talk to a committee about it in                                fact involving a committee soaks up more                                of your time than it does actually doing                                the work you don't give up you can                                delegate to others and say hey listen                                 if someone wants video you guys do it I                                 don't want to be involved in it and you                                 let the left-back group tackle                                 everything related to video and they                                 don't put any work back on you if you                                 don't think those characteristics apply                                 to you believe me they will by the time                                 you finish running on confidence it's                                 also used to useful to have six months                                 of spare time to give up it's also                                 useful to be unemployed don't let all of                                 this discourage you okay it sounds worse                                 than it is but it's not as bad as I'm                                 making it sound you got to be                                 thick-skinned because you're going to                                 receive a lot of criticism but keep in                                 mind that those people criticizing you                                 have never run a conference the people                                 that have grant a conference we're                                 giving you will be giving you advice not                                 criticism and there's a big difference                                 between the two oh and like volunteers                                 in an open source project the people                                 doing the work get to decide how it's                                 done and that's you the conference                                 organizer alright this is actually more                                 important than you think you have to                                 keep in mind what a conference is don't                                 get away from the fact that its people                                 and a subject that's the important thing                                 don't get sidetracked into other issues                                 I can't give you an example of what it                                 is but stick to your core conference                                 activities talks that's it don't get                                 involved in things that you don't want                                 to do just because people say is a good                                 idea to do this just stick with your                                 basic now key points about a conference                                 the main thing pick a topic doesn't                                 matter what it is you've got a bunch of                                 people who are interested in that topic                                 get them together to talk about it your                                 audience basically is users developers                                 or both some people say it's hard to                                 appeal to pope to both groups but often                                 they have a lot more in common than they                                 have in in differences so get them all                                 together sort of listen sorry get them                                 together get them talking to each other                                 because often the developers want to                                 hear from the users and the users have                                 valuable input to give to the the                                 developers often my program committee                                 will say well what are we refuse errs                                 are we for developers and I said well                                 actually work were for both and how do                                 we do that you just take talks from both                                 sides sometimes a very technical                                 sometimes they're very light and fluffy                                 and it doesn't really matter it will                                 appeal to book to both groups but keep                                 keep it in mind that you're getting                                 people together to talk about various                                 things that's the Samantha now what                                 people will expect is quality talks that                                 inform and educate you need to be able                                 to give people that opportunity to get                                 together and talk about things and then                                 afterwards give them tough time to talk                                 about what they just talked about a lot                                 of the activity at a conference is not                                 primarily the talk it's a talk about the                                 talk you get together afterwards over                                 drinks over something else and you're                                 talking about what the people talked                                 about I went to a talk once given by                                 Rasmus the PHP guy and one of the things                                 he mentioned was error handling and you                                 know you can create custom error pages                                 in PHP using the Apache error doc                                 routine and I said oh wow I can use that                                 for fresh ports and now the entire basis                                 is fresh ports is based over one little                                 two minute bit out of his lecture and                                 then I talked to people about that miss                                 a day you can do that it's very easy to                                 just do it the sweat so the whole point                                 of his talk was lost on me but it was                                 just that tiny little bit                                 you don't want to miss that tiny little                                 bit of the talk that may be useful to                                 quality talks what defines a quality                                 talk wow that's really hard to define                                 it's very subjective some people might                                 think a talk is really great because it                                 appeals to them but not all talks will                                 appeal to everyone not everyone likes                                 lager not everyone likes a heavy ale but                                 overall somebody will find something of                                 the like the best complaint you can get                                 as a conference organizer is you've got                                 too many talks at the same time I want                                 to see two talks or both at the same                                 time while I'm sorry too bad don't worry                                 about that just Berkeley you want to                                 help the people with their interests and                                 their jobs and their hobbies and that's                                 what the talks will give you all right                                 social time is very important you want                                 people to get together to talk about the                                 talks that social time can come before                                 your talks after your talks in between                                 your talks it will just for how am i                                 doing for time how much time do I have                                 left somebody tell me                                 cuz half an hour okay good don't do this                                 don't run a conference okay this is my                                 final warning because it's harder than                                 you think it involves just a little bit                                 of time and stress I should have told                                 you this a while ago this one set it                                 will eat up all your time for six months                                 you will have no spare time you won't                                 see your friends you'll hardly see your                                 kids you won't get any work done because                                 all your time is going to be involved in                                 running the conference I was when I ran                                 the first one it's a steep learning                                 curve but you're going to learn a lot                                 and the next one will be easier trust me                                 all the others after the first one get                                 easier it's a seemingly endless stream                                 of tasks that have to be done and you                                 just have to coordinate them get them                                 done in the right border I'll show you                                 the order that I do mine in it's very                                 draining but it's highly rewarding when                                 I took the podium the closing session                                 and bs you can                                                         conference I ran on my own everyone                                 stood up and applauded and abroad tears                                 to my eyes yeah I still get emotional                                 thinking about that ok the next slide is                                 what do attendees want                                 ah I asked a friend of mine Dana who ran                                 conferences professionally she ran                                 conferences for medical professionals                                 and I said how do you run a conference                                 and she said you set a budget and you                                 stick to it but I was no help at all to                                 me I had no idea what she meant by that                                 but yeah that is important to have a                                 budget know how much money is coming in                                 and don't spend more than that so what a                                 speaker's me keep in mind that speakers                                 will you are your biggest asset and also                                 your biggest liability in terms of cost                                 alright they basically need                                 accommodation and travel paid for                                 because most of them can't afford to                                 come to the talks without it some                                 speakers can pay their own way and if                                 they can make sure that they are listed                                 as sponsors whether that's them                                 personally or their employers you have a                                 choice of either reimbursing upfront or                                 paying for it reimbursing the speaker's                                 after the conference are paying for                                 upfront I prefer to pay for it upfront                                 basically reimbursing is lower risk the                                 speaker doesn't turn up you don't have                                 to pet that said in                                                  roughly                                                               two not used and it's due to illness                                 that's roughly one percent so it that                                 said it's not worth taking that the                                 travel insurance speakers need to know                                 their expected top duration do i                                 register do I pay our tutorials included                                 where do I turn up when do I turn up                                 things like that so keep that in mind in                                 that your speakers need to know                                 different things from what your                                 attendees need to know attendees need to                                 know a lot of stuff try and include as                                 much this information as you can on the                                 website                                 make it easy to find

back to them even if you're                                 bitching about them in there they're                                 giving you a hard time don't say                                 anything it will get back to them and                                 you don't want sponsors hearing you                                 saying anything bad about them ok just                                 not that I've had that happen to me but                                 I've seen big professional conferences                                 seen that happen and it's                                 been disaster payment method some people                                 don't like PayPal some people don't mind                                 it decide how you're going to accept                                 payment that's very important get all                                 that organized very early have that                                 already and tested long before you open                                 registration make registration easy                                 easier than bsd can it's a little                                 complex the main thing about the website                                 people come there they want to know                                 where the conferences and when it is                                 that's everything else is not important                                 until they can figure out that they want                                 to know when it is because of the                                 schedule they want to know where it is                                 for travel if those two criteria don't                                 match what they need they're not going                                 to be interested in the rest of the                                 website have this clearly visible on the                                 front page oops oops all right this is                                 the website that I wanted this is a this                                 is what I was interested in but I                                 couldn't tell can anyone tell from this                                 page where it is even if you could read                                 it from the back of the room you can't                                 it doesn't say where the conference is                                 it says when it is but it doesn't say                                 where it is it's not until you go to the                                 registration page that it tells you it's                                 in San Francisco sorry I didn't want to                                 go to San Francisco is too far if it was                                 in New York or something like that it                                 was close enough to me but you couldn't                                 tell without going to the registration                                 page don't do this here's another                                 conference these are just ones that I                                 came across in the in the week or two                                 before this conference what you had to                                 do to get the list of speakers I looked                                 under sessions and all I saw was called                                 for participation speakers I fake human                                 speakers I couldn't see a list of the                                 talks what you had to do was click on                                 the sessions thing to get the list of                                 the talks if you hover your mouse over                                 you get this drop down menu but clicking                                 on sessions is where you found the list                                 of session don't do that that's a silly                                 way to do it I couldn't find it                                 I told them they didn't change it about                                 traps for young players non-core                                 activities don't get involved in in                                 organizing a trip to the latest movie                                 that's come out during the conference                                 unless someone else wants to do that                                 delegate that off to someone else stick                                 only with your core activities

country so you have to decide                                 what needs to go on that based on you                                 but beware that there will be people who                                 will ask for a letter of invitation that                                 you've never heard of they haven't                                 registered and they haven't addressed                                 somewhere in Africa most typically don't                                 even bother to reply to them and you                                 won't hear from them again but if you do                                 reply the cell listen I can't pay until                                 then can I pay cash when I arrived it's                                 a scam I don't know what they're using                                 it for I don't know what they want the                                 letter of invitation for but just don't                                 waste your time but if someone has                                 registered and they paid and they look                                 too legit then yeah send them a letter                                 of registration otherwise ignore it                                 payables keep track of what you owe and                                 to who anywhere just even in a                                 spreadsheet or notebook or something                                 just keep track of that and keep a track                                 of who owes you and whether or not they                                 paid you that's more important than who                                 you paid okay because who you haven't                                 paid they'll remind you but if someone                                 owes you money they won't okay so keep                                 track a lot know what your tax liability                                 is it may not sound like a big deal but                                 if you're doing it personally it may                                 have different implications as whether                                 or not you set up a company where you                                 have a non-profit or something like that                                 set up I've got a company set up just to                                 isolate me from any legal issues that                                 may arise with the company if one of you                                 comes Ottawa and falls down a flight of                                 stairs at the conference you can sue the                                 company but you can't take away my car                                 and there may be laws relating to how                                 you can do this in your own area so keep                                 that in mind to do oh yeah this is my                                 bit this is an idea of how I lay out the                                 time I spend in the months coming up to                                 the conference now I don't know if I got                                 ya about seven months before the                                 conference announced your venue I said                                 it only takes up about six months of                                 your time this tells you otherwise                                 basically seven months and events you                                 have to tell people hey listen I'm                                 having a conference get ready come here                                 why do you have to have that much time                                 because people plan things went out of                                 events speakers are booked well in                                 advance you want to pick your time so                                 you're not near another conference I                                 think the minimum between your                                 conference in someone else's conference                                 if you think it's going to be competing                                 is at least two months you can have it                                 further away than that do it more                                 definitely don't have it a few weeks                                 before or after some other major                                 conference that's on the same topic                                 because not only you depleting the                                 attendee resources more importantly                                 you're taxing the speaker resources and                                 you won't get the attendees without the                                 speaker's about five months out do you                                 call for papers why do you have that leg                                 it's because people have been thinking                                 about the conference already and saying                                 yeah i think i'd like to go to that i                                 don't really want to pay for it yeah                                 i'll give a talk about three months out                                 you will have told all the speakers yes                                 you're coming or sorry no we can't get                                 you here three months is basically the                                 minimum amount of time that most people                                 need in order to plan their travel get                                 travel expenses approved from work get                                 flights booked hotels booked it's not                                 that they do that three months out but                                 they need that three-month buffer                                 that's when you're going to be booking                                 all your travels be traveling speaker                                 your travel accommodation for your                                 speakers unless you tell them to do it                                 on the wrong either way work works you                                 choose which one you want to do to month                                 oh you should have your t-shirts and                                 catering book you'll notice that that's                                 a long time before you actually know                                 your numbers you just have to take a                                 guess on it and closer to the day you                                 will tell your caterers and your                                 suppliers okay this is how many i think                                 i'm getting now about one month out your                                 frantic with registration you're                                 correcting all these things that people                                 change their minds about and that's your                                 primary thing at that time is you're                                 dealing with registration issues at that                                 time you should have a rough idea of                                 your number for t-shirts I've always                                 found that registration numbers double                                 in the last month to give you an idea                                 it's very odd though for PG con people                                 tend to register early and numbers                                 dwindle closer to the conference for BST                                 can numbers start off slow and ran up                                 near the conference so it depends on                                 your audience you thought it was just                                 one page didn't                                 three days before the conference in                                 other words the day before the tutorials                                 this is assuming you're following the                                 two days of tutorials two days of talks                                 patented formula that the tutorials                                 start this is when basically everything                                 should be done except for registration                                 Pat look like that I do the registration                                 packs on the second day of tutorials                                 basically because I start handing them                                 out later on that day the way we do it                                 is we need about three people for about                                 two or three hours just to stuff packs                                 and bags registration opens on

conference you're packing up                                 all the gear and disappearing it's                                 usually at the end of day to the                                 beginning of day three that your stress                                 level is going away and you feel a lot                                 better and you start to feel human again

when                                 you're in a buffet line you want the                                 plates first because you're piling on                                 the food right because all utensils are                                 there you don't want to be carrying the                                 forks and the napkins in your back                                 pocket you want to get to the end of the                                 line and then you get the knifes and the                                 forks and the drinks and stuff and then                                 you walk away if you ever see that at a                                 catering line it's out of order just go                                 in pick them up and move them to the                                 other end no one will notice that you've                                 done it but everyone will be a lot                                 happier                                 I what you're going to do it again the                                 problem with doing it again let me see                                 here where where are we the biggest                                 problem or the biggest time consumption                                 of your first conference is picking your                                 venue and your suppliers once you have a                                 good venue and good suppliers keep using                                 them I've used the same for this will be                                 the                                                                    held at University of Ottawa it's always                                 had the same supplier of t-shirts always                                 had the same food caterers always had                                 the same people giving me the lanyards                                 in the bags why do I keep using them                                 because they've always delivered they                                 never had a hassle they never made                                 mistakes they've always delivered on                                 time with what I needed so if you can                                 find people who do that keep using them                                 there's no sense in changing unless you                                 really really have to because then you                                 have to re-educate them as to what you                                 want and they have to learn way they                                 need to deliver don't if you can avoid                                 wasting the time on changing don't the                                 other advantage if you've been to a                                 conference before and it's the same                                 venue it's a lot more comfortable for                                 the attendees they don't have to wander                                 around trying to find the building even                                 though the buildings of BSB can change                                 every year you know what's at the campus                                 you know it's out the university so if                                 you can have it in the same venue it's                                 more comfortable for the attendees and a                                 lot less stress for you I would be                                 surprised if nobody has questions                                 because there's a lot about this that I                                 haven't covered ass                                 your costs are going to vary okay                                 insurance I don't have any there's no                                 there was no some venues will require                                 you to have insurance the venue i'm                                 using doesn't require me to have                                 insurance and the way I'm looking at it                                 if someone decides to sue the company                                 there's not much money in there and I'm                                 not worried about it that's why I've got                                 the companies to isolate me from                                 personal liability finances they vary                                 according to your venue for an example                                 at the University of Ottawa one room for                                 one day costs about two thousand dollars                                 a thing but how much each individual                                 thing costs won't help you because all                                 my costs are in canadian dollars yep yep                                 it's useful to have hire a professional                                 bookkeeper and get them to keep track of                                 all the finances are you asking from                                 point of view making sure you don't go                                 broke like my friend said set a budget                                 figure out how much your venue is going                                 to cost then take an estimate on how                                 many attendees you're going to have and                                 see how that meets up when you guess how                                 much you're going to get for sponsorship                                 when I first did it ten years ago I                                 figured it was going to cost me four                                 thousand dollars to run the conference                                 and I figured if based on a                                 two-hundred-dollar attendee I figured                                 what was at the mouth I needed somebody                                 do the math for me four thousand /                                                                                                           and it turned out I got about                                           but then my expenses went up because I                                 didn't include things like lunches and                                 but I think actually we sent everyone                                 out to lunch the first year because we                                 had no idea how to do any of that I'm                                 not helping you Emma                                 I'm sorry ha any other question sir we                                 had Wi-Fi problems the first couple of                                 years because we're doing it ourselves                                 and then the next couple of years the                                 university took it over but then over                                 the past five years it's been pretty                                 good we have problems sometimes at the                                 beginning of the day when they don't                                 have it set up right but that's usually                                 during the tutorials and by the                                 conference proper it's settled down it                                 runs quite well basically apologize and                                 stop worrying about it seriously you                                 can't solve all the problems if you can                                 you solve it if you can't just say I'm                                 sorry folks I can't fix this and worry                                 about the next thing it's along the                                 lines of compartmentalization solve this                                 problem move on to the next hour                                 it was kind of slow downloading the                                     I saw yesterday but yeah I haven't had                                 any problem what you do then is you                                 stipulate in advance that you you know                                 basic make that well-known don't leave                                 it to the last minute yeah yeah yeah and                                 what you do is you say I'm sorry I can't                                 fix this and you move on to the next                                 problem seriously you cannot fix                                 everything and do not take it personally                                 if something goes wrong you'll just                                 devastate yourself and you know                                 happens and you Jews good as well as you                                 can given the circumstances and if                                 something goes wrong um how you'll know                                 what this means as a conference                                 organizer you see lots of things that                                 have gone wrong but use a conference                                 attendee don't see it maybe one or two                                 of you see it but that's all and that                                 doesn't matter I think the biggest                                 disaster I've had at a conference is                                 having one speaker that didn't show up                                 at all they didn't tell me they weren't                                 coming they just                                 turn up all I did is walked into the                                 room there were two people waiting for                                 his talk and I said I'm sorry I don't                                 know where the speaker is yeah I think                                 the biggest problem we had was when the                                 volcanic ash was up over Iceland two                                 years ago three years ago yeah we had                                 trouble getting speakers to the                                 conference and I was getting calls at                                                                                                       from Heathrow and that was a much bigger                                 expense because you had to book your                                 flights the same day fortunately there's                                 only two speakers but it was less sleep                                 you won't get some nights you won't get                                 any sleep but don't worry about that you                                 can sleep after the conference                                 keep notes you're um oh I actually keep                                 a repository and CVS of everything that                                 I'm doing all the procedures like this                                 is how I print the badges this is how I                                 update the website for next year that's                                 all in CVS pick your repository but                                 basically document what you're doing and                                 maybe why you're doing it I'll give you                                 a good example of why you document why                                 you're doing it friend of mine was                                 having her mother helped her put away                                 the dishes from the dishwasher and her                                 mother said where do these little                                 plastic cups go these little plastic                                 glasses she said down there with the                                 pots and pans why would the little                                 plastic cups go down there with a                                 plastic pen with though why the little                                 plastic caps go down there with the pots                                 and pans and she said so the kids can                                 get a drink without having to ask us for                                 glasses think about that when you're                                 doing something weird in your code okay                                 it doesn't make sense until you give                                 that explanation and then it's perfectly                                 sensible another question                                 anything                                 I was I think I started PG con in                                                                                                               three or four years probably up to about                                                                                                          which happens the week after so in                                 effect i'm running to conferences in two                                 weeks with a total of about                                            so i imagine i could do one conference                                 with                                                                    doing it over two weeks so it doesn't                                 make much difference so it's about the                                 same so imagine that the only problem                                 there is the venue I don't have a venue                                 big enough to handle                                                     torture so basically the things to do if                                 you think running one conference has                                 become too easy what you do is you move                                 to another country and run it from there                                 then what you do is you break your arm                                 and have surgery a little while before                                 the conference then what you do is you                                 start running to conferences within two                                 weeks of each other for different groups                                 I would actually like to become a                                 professional conference organizer I                                 enjoy it I find it challenging but I                                 find it natural as well I'm not lying                                 when someone asks me you know you're                                 really good at this what are you doing                                 and I say I I really don't know how to                                 run a conference I couldn't highlight                                 the things to do right or wrong I just                                 knew that this is the way to do it and I                                 don't know how I knew that so I'd like                                 to be a professional conference                                 organizer if I could do that the problem                                 is income it's not I don't think I could                                 make a living at it and not I think it                                 could make a living at it if i tripled                                 the admission prices but I don't think                                 I'd get the attendees any other yeah um                                 well the first PSD conference didn't                                 have very big sponsors one of the where                                 are we over here if you go to BS you can                                 /                                                                   aren't very well-known companies there                                 were local companies basically providing                                 people to help out as time went on I'm                                 now at the point of where Google will                                 send me an email saying hi Dan bc can                                                                                                      order so they're telling me that they're                                 going to sponsor before I ask them I                                 always go back to my original sponsors                                 from the previous year get in touch with                                 them six seven months before the new                                 conference you outline what you can                                 provide and say you know it's very you                                 know we can't run this conference                                 without sponsorship these are the                                 benefits of being a sponsor thank you                                 very much and basically you look at the                                 other conferences see who's sponsoring                                 them and approach the same group                                 because if someone's interested in yer                                 abuse you come they're probably                                 interested in something very similar                                 somewhere else but sponsorships the                                 hardest thing we get about fifty percent                                 from Europe and the rest are from Canada                                 in the States and we go say PG con gets                                 three or four people from Japan one or                                 two from Australia and New Zealand a                                 couple from somewhere in Africa a couple                                 from somewhere in South America and then                                 by far the vast majority are from the                                 European Union and the rest are from the                                 states and canada                                 um I can ask you a question but I have                                 to elaborate on that i started off                                 offering free attend the free for staff                                 faculty and students because they were                                 giving us very useful things like not                                 chosen you know here's the internet use                                 it stuff like that but now they're                                 charging us for the internet so it's                                 gone from it's a much more commercial                                 setup now we pay commercial rates for                                 the venue so i'm thinking of actually                                 changing that from free to a modest fee                                 basically because we have to set aside                                 meal t-shirt all that stuff for people                                 who sign up and then don't show up so                                 out of above                                                           up for the free option only three or                                 four turn up so when you're planning                                 your catering you don't actually order                                 the catering for the number of people                                 that you have on the list you order for                                 about eighty to ninety percent of the                                 people that you have on your list                                 surprisingly                                 yep the other thing is the t-shirts                                 don't run out of t-shirts people want                                 the t-shirts more than they want the                                 conference more questions                                 sorry                                 some sponsors the biggest thing that                                 some sponsors one is your names and                                 addresses and I don't give it to them                                 and the reason I don't is because I                                 don't think that's proper the second                                 biggest thing they want is put things in                                 the registration pack they want to put                                 their marketing material in front of it                                 the other thing i want is signs right                                 here because it'll be on the video the                                 other thing you can do is to get someone                                 to pay for the video is to have a splash                                 page at the beginning of the video with                                 the sponsors name on it that's worth a                                 lot of money don't undersell that                                 because that's permanent the lanyards                                 and the bags are temporary the video                                 lasts a very long time and it will have                                 the sponsors name on there for a very                                 long time so don't sell that off cheap                                 does that aunt does that answer your                                 question yeah but yeah your names on the                                 bags names and the lanyards names on the                                 videos that's all worth a lot of money                                 and don't undersell it                                 people                                 yep one of the big things that they want                                 to be as she can is a jobs board just a                                 bulletin board there that has pieces of                                 paper that says we're looking for people                                 to fill these positions okay it's time                                 to finish yeah yeah do you yeah one of                                 the things we don't do one of the things                                 I don't do is allow commercial talks                                 sure if the sponsor wants to submit a                                 talk it'll be evaluated the same as any                                 other talk but we don't we don't say                                 okay your sponsor here's your                                            to sit in front of everyone and talk I                                 don't do that commercial it's it's a                                 non-commercial conference if it was a                                 sales conference or something like that                                 it would be different but basically it's                                 the integrity of the talks we don't sell                                 conference slots will sell spots in the                                 bag and the signage but we don't saw                                 slots if you have any other questions                                 find me I think you'd be able to locate
