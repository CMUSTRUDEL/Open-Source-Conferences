	                              hi I guess it's time to start and as I                               know you guys just have lunch and you                               would rather take a nap and not listen                               to me rambling about the ipsec but i'll                               try to be as entertaining as possible                               yeah alright so my name is mike bella                               poo hoof and the developer with the                               openbsd project and i'm working for one                               chronic secure systems that produces                                networking appliances based on openbsd                                and yeah as this Soviet times polish                                poster says what have you done to                                fulfill the plan and why you should be                                listening to me well I am implemented                                most of the stuff i'll be covering in                                this talk and I guess it would be the                                right time to ask me questions if you                                have any but the things that are we                                talking about we are implemented on the                                course of multiple releases and over a                                couple of years and some details might                                be already forgotten so I ask you to                                please excuse me right so let's get                                started first of all I want to talk                                about the new eyes and I instruction set                                that was implemented in into West Mia                                and new a course in fact it's a two                                instruction set the instructions                                instruction set extensions that will be                                talking about is my and see Elmo and                                something without children anyways the                                intel introduced a bunch of new SS e                                instruction                                sse is a FP you a part of FP you not the                                CPU and the instructions introduced were                                is encrypt is decrypt is encrypt last as                                it could last for the final round of is                                encryption and two instructions that                                faciliate the is cleans patch expansion                                procedure I asked you keygen assist and                                is I am see this instructions operate on                                XM m registers which is yeah and I                                forgot to mention the the instruction to                                perform carry less multiplication pc pc                                el mal q DQ carry less multiplication is                                so what this instruction does it takes                                to XM m registers field xmm registers if                                you don't remember at                                                  but it uses only                                                       performs multiplication of                                       basically vectors it's a vector                                multiplication producing on                                        result so as i mentioned these are the                                SSE instructions and but we wanted to                                use them in the kernel to be able to                                implement the the acceleration of the                                ious algorithms used in the ipsec                                processing so normally a floating-point                                arithmetic are not used in the colonel                                and there's a very good reason for that                                the thing is that cpu and FP you have                                different contexts that means that well                                task switches away from the cpu it                                doesn't necessarily mean that it                                switches awaits FPU                                contacts so FPU contacts can be                                preserved right between tax switches and                                that means that the whoever calls the                                SSC instruction needs to first to                                prepare a new FPU context and save the                                old one so that it can possibly restore                                it afterwards so this is this this this                                mechanism was reasonably new for our                                kernel and for for that purpose we have                                implemented the locking interface FPU                                Colonel enter and a few Colonel exit                                which denotes a which denotes has a                                critical section where at threat that                                has taken this basically look cannot be                                involuntary switched away and has to and                                also must clear the existing context and                                prepare a new one so that it can proceed                                with the with those SS instructions                                another heavy it in that it cannot be                                safely used in the interrupt context the                                thing is that switching FP or saving FPU                                context might require you to send an IP                                I and wait for the result to synchronize                                it with other cpus and if you were                                wondering if the ice instruction set is                                unique to Intel and I am deep ball                                daughter cpus no it's not the newest                                Oracle spark tea for CPU which is a                                continuation of the ultrasparc T line                                and also has also features and is                                instruction set although                                is not compatible with isni and it was                                also announced that arm v                                              and power                                                             feature the ious instructions now let's                                 take a look at the new encryption mode                                 for a cipher that was recently developed                                 and standardized by different committees                                 and this is a combined authentication                                 encryption transformation which means                                 that while processing the data the the                                 authentication tag is calculated at the                                 same time as the encryption happens the                                 message authentication code as I denoted                                 it here although it's not exactly                                 correct but that's what most of the                                 people are used to because in as GCM                                 this this this piece is not cold message                                 authentication code is it's called                                 authentication tag but it's basically                                 like we can consider it to be like a                                 synonym for the for this talk just so                                 that we don't get confused so what kind                                 of mac it generates it generates one                                 heart what he ate bit mac not truncated                                 that means that there was actually a                                 couple of variations of this ice GCM                                 standard specified the differ by the by                                 the length of the attack and                                         mins                                                                     in fact is GCM                                                         also as GCM if i'm on a second                                           which basically just takes this mac and                                 truncates it that's a normal practice                                 like                                 h mark hashes were also truncated in the                                 ipsec but in open busy we are using a                                 non truncated version because most of                                 the most of the requirement documents                                 they actually specify only the full                                 version they never nobody really cares                                 about the truncated ones also it's                                 possible to use an authentication only                                 version where you just don't encrypt the                                 plaintext you don't generate the                                 ciphertext and in this case the                                 algorithm is called is gmac and                                 essentially this algorithm is just a                                 combination of eyes used in the counter                                 mode and a special gmac hashing function                                 that i will be talking about later so                                 where is it used it uses in the new max                                 security standard for layer to                                 encryption in Ethernet networks in fibre                                 channel security protocols to encrypt                                 fibre channel in ipsec it's also                                 specified for association TLS but I'm                                 not sure about open SSL and TLS but we                                 don't implement it in ssh yet NSA's                                 you'd be which is a which is a suit that                                 the creature suit of cryptographic                                 algorithm that it's in fact like a like                                 a document published by NSA that                                 describes which algorithms should use                                 for which purpose and NSA should be                                 endorse a sip and doses DCM as a                                 preferred mode of IOUs in fact the older                                 version of the presentation set as a                                 preferred mode of IOUs for network                                 encryption but I went and looked it up                                 again and I haven't found any other                                 modes that they actually endorsed so                                 they say Aya's should be all                                 we used in GCM mode it's also optional                                 in the usg v                                                           united states government with six                                 compliance specification at which is a                                 list of requirements for US government                                 contractors it was released it was it                                 was released like a couple of years ago                                 and the basic purpose of it is to be is                                 to to make a set of rules for new                                 contractions saying ipv                                          equipment for the United States                                 government's everyone who sells this                                 equipment they have to comply and right                                 now or like a couple of months ago the                                 DCM cipher was optional but it can be                                 perfectly promoted to to to mast and                                 it's also any standards well it's all                                 started with a new standard in fact so                                 let's just take a alameda made a few                                 slides to just briefly talk about how is                                 the same operates and why is it                                 different from the other modes and here                                 we define our input to the cipher and                                 outputs or to the mode so a secret key                                 for is obviously of                                                     long and initialization vector in fact                                 in the GCM the initialization vector is                                 called knowns the same way it's calling                                 the is CTR a plain text of up to                                    gigabytes and an optional additional                                 authenticated data this data is provided                                 to the cipher and will only be                                 authenticated but not encrypted that's                                 another another thing why this modus is                                 really a little bit special the outputs                                 of the of the mode is a cipher text of                                 the same lessons plain text because is                                 GCM uses is CTR the counter mode turns a                                 block cipher into a stream cipher                                 so the length of the side projects is                                 the same and the authentication tag is                                 one hunt when he ate bits long so this                                 is the the high-level view on the on how                                 which data is getting processed by the                                 by the mode here in on the top we have a                                 a let me draw it bit i'm talking about                                 this part here right so this is this is                                 basically a structure that resembles for                                 example in an ESP packet it has a header                                 for example it has a an n spi the                                 security parameter index and for example                                 in ESP has a an installation vector and                                 and the data obviously so the way this                                 the waste cipher works is that we take a                                 sensation vector we take care we take                                 keys actually they're not depicted on a                                 picture and we supply to the DCM                                 encryption engine along with plain text                                 and output will be a ciphertext the                                 encrypted data the ICB which is which is                                 an authentication tag and the header and                                 is like the sequence number are copied                                 untouched and unencrypted but they are                                 also authenticated because they are                                 supplied as as as authentication data so                                 that's that's that's the crucial                                 difference here because in a is cbc with                                 h mac mode the spi of the ESP packet is                                 not authenticated                                 GCM fixes this by providing an ocean of                                 additional authenticated data now let's                                 take a look at the how a bit more loyal                                 picture depicting how the GCM mode works                                 frankly I was trying to find a simple                                 picture and this is the the simple cycle                                 I have found and I have tweaked it to be                                 even more simpler so this is this might                                 not be one hundred percent correct                                 because it also requires a bit of an                                 explanation so the way the way to look                                 at these pictures that this part here on                                 the right this is essentially an ice                                 counter mode we take that we we                                 increment the counter we encrypt it with                                 our generated keys because encounter                                 multi you encrypt the counter block you                                 don't encrypt the the plain text itself                                 you can click encrypt the counter block                                 and that gets you what they call key                                 stream and then you XOR it with the                                 plain text and that's how you get cipher                                 text in s CTR so this part just denotes                                 is CTR so let's take a look at what                                 happens on the left they the first thing                                 that happens is that when Ivy is taken                                 and counter value is appended to it and                                 gets encrypted you get the first book                                 which is basically a which wich is you                                 specially in this mode what happens to                                 it is that it's fat to the                                 it's saved and then it would be fair to                                 the G hash here now this is just saved                                 for now right we just which store it in                                 the context and we don't do anything                                 with it and we started ripping with                                 wisps counter value one we starting keep                                 in plain text now when we are when the                                 GCM works on blocks update                                         blocks so as long as you have that                                 amount of plaintext to process you run                                 the ear on the ictr algorithm but on                                 every on every block you also sand by                                 this you can see this feedback kind of                                 arrow you send it to G hash and you've a                                  oh I forgot to mention first after                                 we we've done with ivy and generating                                 this blog we feed additional                                 authentication data to G hash and it                                 stays in the corn in the hash context                                 then and now oops and now when we feed                                 our blocks of ciphertext                                                 ASIC alee every time we hash a block we                                 save it in the context and in the end                                 when we have done processing plain text                                 what we do is that we XOR our initial                                 counter block in fact it's called this                                 way with the g dash value that we have                                 and this is how we get the                                 authentication tag pretty simple let's                                 talk about implementations that we did                                 in openbsd there in fact two                                 implementations the portable written in                                 C so that we can get a feel of the                                 cipher we can do the test vectors and                                 stuff we can understand if we got the                                 algorithm correctly and the second                                 foundation is the implementation                                 written in SOC assembly and the sig glue                                 code that makes use of the iso nine is                                 and I and see Elmo instruction                                 extensions the portable implementation                                 is is is divided in several parts in                                 fact there are three parts one is not                                 described on this slide which is ICTR we                                 just used the ictr that we had                                 previously implemented in our trip                                 library framework and the two remaining                                 components is the DG hash and roped into                                 the more high-level API so that we can                                 divide it in two different stages like                                 he needs said kiri need update final                                 which is called is gmac and implemented                                 in sis crypto gmac C&H and it's a                                 straightforward implementation it uses                                                                                                        seeds or all in C and it's very slow                                 because the multiplication in the finite                                 field that is one of the core techniques                                 in the in the G hash is has to be done                                 bit by bit you multiply vectors bit by                                 bit and this bit accesses and doing this                                 in the runtime kills performance a big                                 time so there exists exists a method to                                 improve performance by a large amount                                 large amount by implementing the tables                                 of pre computed coefficients so it means                                 in the initial phase when you set up                                 your your cipher context you precompute                                 the whole table of coefficients and then                                 you just look look them up and use in                                 the inexorable                                 this is not implemented yet but                                 something that is reasonably needed                                 because of wealth obvious reasons we                                 don't have it on any other architecture                                 the other than in fact I'm e                                             the other part of the of the mode that                                 needs needed to be implemented is the is                                 an actual function doing the GCM                                 processing in the cryptographic                                 framework and i will will be talking a                                 bit about framework itself in a few                                 minutes but I just must say that the                                 cryptograph frameworks works with nature                                 with M buffs or I avec top type                                 structures and basically what we need in                                 creeper a framework is a function that                                 traverses the chain and calls the right                                 functions at the right moment in the                                 right order so this is what software                                 creep to combine routine is doing and                                 unfortunately there is also a                                 simplification I implemented because the                                 the the whole thing is rather                                 complicated and I didn't want to                                 complicate it even more from from the                                 start and I just use em copy debt data                                 and M copy back the above data handing                                 routines instead of traversing above                                 queues and doing basically a well it's                                 not exactly zero copy because you still                                 have to load xmm registers but it's                                 close to that right now I'm doing and an                                 unneeded copying but that can be                                 optimized let's take a look d assembly                                 assembly was written in fact by Intel                                 and it was released we actually                                 requested them to release it on the BSD                                 license and they they did and thanks for                                 them because that saved                                 a lot of trouble for us and this file                                 she's our MD                                                             and only exists form d                                                   because it hasn't been ported to                                        architecture in fact it requires                                 different function calling convention                                 and all other things that we didn't do                                 so if someone can pick up this task that                                 would be a great great thing and I know                                 that freebsd have taken this and taking                                 this violence plated into more usable                                 parts and adding more c code to simplify                                 it but this hasn't been i haven't looked                                 very closely and i'm not sure how like I                                 know that they still have a lot of                                 assembly code for four key generation                                 day I think they didn't pour that but                                 that's something to to to look for                                 suddenly unfortunately I think they                                 don't implement jejeje Mac interface and                                 GMAC requires additional XML registers                                 and I                                                                mistaken yeah and and this is for users                                                                                                          needs to be overcome this file                                 implements a bunch of functions I said I                                 said key to do the key expansion to                                 generate the key why is it important to                                 have I as a key generic expansion                                 written in a see assembly well it                                 doesn't matter for for an ipsec tunnel                                 that that creates connection once like                                 once a month and then it states and it                                 runs for months and like does nothing                                 but what if you have a VPN gateway that                                 serves hundreds or thousands connections                                 daily key expansion is extremely                                 extremely                                 a slow procedure in fact openbsd users                                 the blowfish blowfish a key expansion                                 code for password encryption because                                 it's it's very very complicated so it                                 takes a lot of resources to compute                                 right ison i encrypt decrypt that that's                                 clear it implements basically around Oh                                 fires eyes and I ECB is not used because                                 ECB is not used in ipsec or anywhere                                 else in fact and shouldn't be used CBC                                 which is used an ipsec CTR same thing                                 and two functions that I have most                                 implement myself although I took some of                                 the Intel encode from the white paper                                 that implemented the the day it's called                                 reduction steps in the in the delois                                 hash function yeah I'm sorry I forgot to                                 tell that GCM stands for Galois counter                                 mode gallois was a mathematician that                                 started the finite field theory so the                                 cypress called just after him that's an                                 interest in fact okay so how does this i                                 sighs how does this assam assembly a                                 ropes up into a driver for the                                 cryptographic framework well there is a                                 safe while that actually implements this                                 whole interface and it's it's                                 essentially a row Perales an assembly                                 and currently it supports a serrated is                                 CBC is TT RS GCM                                                         then I select a bit on committing this                                 mission stuff and GCM stuff was                                 committed only in                                                       way ipsec because of the way                                 cryptographic framework operates                                 in case you just in case you are using                                 is CBC with H max shall one that each                                 moksha one cannot be accelerated by this                                 driver at least right now so in case you                                 are using this transformation and you                                 still want to use is CBC from my SN I                                 you need to basically call software                                 crypto for all your H Mac routine                                 switches which would the driver does as                                 well so the future projects in this area                                 is to clean up assembly maybe make it                                 faster they in fact because is is is                                 specified in as a big-endian ciphers                                 most of the other cryptographic                                 algorithms lots of well in fact not in                                 the S code in the GCM code there's lots                                 of Indian conversions going on and maybe                                 some of them can be lost port to i                                    well I've talked a bit about it don't                                 want to stop on this implement I                                     it's not hard to implement I                                             only reason why it wasn't done is                                 because we we don't have consumers for                                 this the only possible consumer is a                                 soft rate crypt or a crypto mode but I                                 will be talking about it bit later but                                 they just want to mention that it's not                                 possible right now for creep creep for                                 soft rate would be to just use the is                                                                                                          fact well I can mention it right now                                 because time is right now soft rate does                                 not go through the crypto thread it                                 calls crypto framework invoke method                                 that i will be talking about a bit later                                 directly and what it what happens it                                 loses process contacts and you can't use                                 as a night not in the process in the                                 interrupt contact                                 evaluate a week's ABX is at once worked                                 vector extensions and USS e instruction                                 extension set release by until in the                                 new CPUs I think send d breaching up                                 basically a VX is very interesting thing                                 it extends                                                              registers also it adds and updates most                                 of the SSE instructions dealing with                                 falling point mass to operate on                                         registers but also it adds a a set of                                 commands basically it duplicates every                                 almost every single SSE instruction                                 within the same instruction but with a V                                 prefix that takes one argument more to                                 save the result of the operation this is                                 a crucial thing for people doing like                                 automatic vectorization in compilers                                 that they have basically aside                                 side-effect free instructions and maybe                                 it's possible to gain something for eyes                                 and I with from I weeks I'm not sure I                                 week should be I weeks requires                                 additional support from operating system                                 that is also lacking in Oakland busy so                                 somebody can step up and write the code                                 ok let's talk just a bit about                                 cryptographic framework and just so that                                 we will understand what's the what's the                                 thing behind this call so it was                                 implemented by it was designed and                                 mostly implemented by angelo crm it is                                 for pin busy                                                          ago the main purpose of the framework is                                 to provide consumers which are colonel                                 services like ipsec to provide for the                                 provide access to the hardware crypt                                 accelerators so it just it's just a                                 framework that allows you to                                 right unified drivers for cryptographic                                 accelerators and an IPSec stack and                                 other consumers within the colonel to                                 have a unified interface to access them                                 so it implements two devices or                                       sorry the implementation includes the                                 colonel api which is described by                                 Krypton nine-month page and the and the                                 user lent interface that is done through                                 a device charger device def crypto that                                 is described in the crypt appointment                                 page the framework operates on em buffs

the completion                                 face when cryptographic / went when the                                 cryptographic transformation has                                 happened you might need to do further                                 processing like an IPSec stack for                                 example and this is this is where you                                 supply the pointer for a call back free                                 wreck when you're done with the                                 descriptors and free session when you                                 down with a session now let's take a                                 look how it keep the dispatch works grip                                 the dispatch in fact doesn't do doesn't                                 coprocessor                                                         creates a work you task and for a crypto                                 threat to to to to deal with so                                 basically the only thing that keeps                                 dispatch does is just work you cute ask                                 well keep the work when triple threat is                                 being woken up by the work you subsystem                                 it called script invoke function which                                 which the only purpose of it is to call                                 the stuff I if look up the the the                                 hardware driver and call its process                                 routine an actual work happens in the in                                 the driver processing direct request and                                 here on this picture you can see I                                 specifically added this comment here to                                 denote that here in fact the crypto done                                 a function might not be called directly                                 but what happens in the PC a                                 cryptographic accelerators that you                                 create and you feel you feel a ring with                                 with that you feel the DMA ring with the                                 with the packets you want to process and                                 you signal the car to start the oysters                                 to start doing so and and you exit then                                 the interrupt happens and the interrupt                                 handler does the Q procession q                                 completion and the final final step in                                 this Q completion routines to coal creek                                 is to hand back the Crypt a descriptor                                 back to the cryptographic framework by                                 call encrypted on Krypto done will not                                 call anything directly like the callback                                 it will in queue and you task same                                 crypto threads once again for it to call                                 the callback and the only thing that                                 crypt threats will do is call the                                 callback so why is it done this way why                                 are we why we're not calling these                                 functions directly                                 well there are several reasons for them                                 I try to be fast so the the main reason                                 is that this part is a network stack and                                 this part is a network stack for example                                 in the East PKS that's the top one is                                 the ESP input and the bottom one is ESP                                 input call back so these parts they run                                 as part of the IP software interrupt                                 which has an IP level IPL soft nap the                                 cryptographic accelerator runs at IPL                                 net which is higher than that so the                                 problem is that in the interrupt context                                 or in fact anywhere else you can't lower                                 your SPL level unless you know the                                 previous one and in because of this                                 function chain you actually at point at                                 the point when crypto dollars invoked                                 you don't know which SP a level was                                 there and in case of interrupt it's not                                 even possible to do it correctly so                                 that's why we have to basically jump                                 through the hoops and call it this way                                 now just to brief slide about the old                                 pci and pci x script accelerations in                                 fact the latest broad conversion which                                 is pci express in in essence is a pci x                                 device with the pci x                                               bridge so it's still a piece x device so                                 it was a great idea back in the                                          they decided to a float trip to a pci                                 device although even back then they                                 understood that having lots of small                                 having lots of busty one's actions doing                                 crypto for tiny packets is also not very                                 not very doesn't bring much of the                                 performance improvement these devices                                 are usually usually capable of doing                                 symmetrical crypto like there's three                                 days or is in some particular mode like                                 I see                                 bc and you can't make this device to ICT                                 unless it supports it they also can                                 perform in the same round of dma process                                 in NH Mac operation usually its md                                  where sha-                                                         random number generator I didn't mention                                 it and public engine that the only                                 purpose we have found for it in open                                 business to use use it as a modulus but                                 to perform modular exponentiation                                 procedures that is used for inner sa so                                 unless you and jochen and recently we                                 have figured out that in fact this                                 script accelerators and the way we that                                 the whole word that was done to support                                 them is actually not not exactly a                                 rewarding because now most of this                                 hardware is not                                                       you need to is implement balls buffer so                                 you need to implement you need to take                                 buffers from the lower memory or you                                 need to run it in the system with iommu                                 and things like that and we have just                                 figured this out in time for enabling                                 the big man on mg                                               possibility for the colonel to access                                 memory above                                                            drivers contain some extra logic to                                 perform to to to to handle for example                                 the initiation vectors and other                                 parameters that can be wrong recently                                 when those allegations ipsec allegations                                 you might have heard of it started we                                 started looking to that and we found                                 that the initialization vector                                 processing in these drivers was in fact                                 wrong what was happening is that drivers                                 implemented the old way of not realizing                                 installation vector for every packet but                                 doing that only for the first one and                                 for the later packets taking the last                                 bites of the previously encrypted                                 packets apparently the old specification                                 from CBC state or like for ipsec emotion                                 stated this way of processing but all                                 the new specifications say well if you                                 do that and you can control input and                                 you can look at the output you can                                 correlate the the ciphertext that you                                 produce with the plant with the                                 plaintext that generated and you can                                 really get close to recovering the key                                 and the only reason why would you use                                 them right now is for heavy modular                                 exponentiation is still very expensive                                 in software and it uses large chunks of                                 data so it's still relevant if you run                                 for example ssl okay i'm running out of                                 time right just want to mention what do                                 what do you want to do in the future                                 with ocf unfortunately I didn't have                                 enough time to talk about the extended                                 sequence numbers but I have added                                 support to the cryptograph framework and                                 to the ikea v                                                           support to other drivers including the                                 ice ice and i we want to use multiple                                 work is instead of crypto threat to make                                 it perform baton SMP machines with                                 minute we want to rethink locking and we                                 want to improve gmac performance the sea                                 version and we want to convert soft ray                                 to use work you ok unfortunately I ran                                 out of time so what's the plan the                                 questions or or no time for questions                                 nobody knows so we can do some questions                                 do does anyone have any questions please                                 pick up                                 wait a minute away first Mike all that                                 ASM code was for from Intel does it work                                 on AMD CPUs de switch from what I know                                 also include those instructions I mean                                 that yeah I didn't try I haven't seen                                 those CPUs yet I mean I nearly forgot                                 that md existing for enough it should it                                 should they implement the same set of                                 instructions any other questions all                                 right
