Description: 
	Fireside Chat on Open Source Program Offices (OSPO) - Shilla Saebi, Comcast;Nigel Simpson, Disney; &Moderator â€“ John Mertic, Academy Software Foundation

A pattern amongst leading organizations engaging in open source is the formation of an Open Source Program Office (OSPO), which provides a center of excellence for the organization in contributing to, leading, and measuring the impact of open source within the organization. In this fireside chat moderated by John Mertic from The Linux Foundation, you will hear from two leaders in the space who have helped establish and maintain OSPOs on what they are and what their impacts are in the organization.

hopefully everyone can see my screen

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,400
relatively well hopefully slide awesome

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,080
uh so i want to as we talked about the

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
second half of the day here

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,519
it's going to be a lot of thought

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,280
leadership on open source program

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
offices

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
along with you know just seeing how

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
different

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,240
foundation open source foundations

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
operate

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,000
especially as the academy software

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,640
foundation is getting to that point

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,439
where

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,400
it's at that three-year mark and it's a

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,640
great place to be

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,559
at a foundation learning some of the

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,800
successes some of the things that

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,559
uh to consider things that the project

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,399
might want to think about going forward

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,160
and i think all things that all of us

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,360
even to take back inside of our member

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,559
organizations

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,800
can potentially benefit from as well so

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,320
we want to kick off here with a fireside

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,680
chat

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,719
focused on open source program offices

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,039
and we're fortunate here to be

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,039
with two folks who have done a ton of

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,239
work in this space

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,439
i want to start off by first introducing

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,600
nigel simpson he's an open source

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,200
and product strategy consultant and

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,600
previously founded and led

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
disney's open source program um nigel i

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,439
don't know if you're i think you're on

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,840
the line i don't know if you want to

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,680
introduce yourself and say a few words

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
hi john hi everyone uh it's great to be

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,159
here um yeah so i

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,119
um got the open source bug at some

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
record systems

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,439
i was working on research projects and

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,799
started working in the in the outside

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,119
world with open source

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,640
and when i came to disney i kind of

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,680
discovered that this didn't have that

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
culture and so

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,360
work to change the culture there to

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,960
support open source and

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,479
establish business open source program

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,880
office and now

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,680
uh working in the capacity to consult

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,079
them sort of come

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,360
full circle actually uh working with

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,680
startups that are

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,119
building in the uh building products in

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,960
the open source space so it's an

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,439
exciting time to be uh

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,520
in that area and glad to be here to be

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,439

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,040
of the comcast open source office

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,400
she's an open source program manager um

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,920
and comcast is

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,599
probably one of the great examples of

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,680
open source program offices

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,360
that we see um should i know if you want

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,520

cloud team

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
and i'm passionate about building

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,440
communities internally through

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,360
intersource

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,599
and helping grow open source communities

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,360
for projects that we release

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,040
i'm also an open source contributor and

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
maintainer and

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,280
i am a cloud native computing foundation

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
ambassador

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
awesome well thank you for joining us as

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,159
well um introduce yourself my name is

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,959
john murtick i'm one of the program

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,519
directors here at the linux foundation

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,879
so i want to start off because the

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,159
concept you're going to hear the term

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,000
we're going to say ospo

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,080
all the time here in this conversation

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,640
and that stands for open source program

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,760
office and for many of you this may be a

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,159
new term

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,599
so i want to sort of toss this off um

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,319
and and sheila i want to toss it to you

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,959
first

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
what is an open source program office or

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,120
is

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,080
it's called here ospo sure um

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,480
so our open source program office we are

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,440
a team that consists of roughly six

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,120
people total um and we're a center of

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,799
excellence for our organizations

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,440
open source strategy operations and

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,680
at all things related to open source we

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,000
support roughly 9000 technologists

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,239
within our organization

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,560
our ospo works on educating our

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,439
community with our open source strategy

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,760
internally and outside the company too

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,599
we organize events like hackathons

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,519
trainings presentations for our

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,640
community from internal and external

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,720
speakers

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,560
we also help guide our technologists

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,439
with persistent releases of code

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,720
upstream

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,000
whether that means uh helping folks get

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,440
comfortable with the open source

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,280
community or if they want to stay uh

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,960
spin up a brand new standalone open

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,639
source project or contributing to

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,400
existing open source projects

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,960
that are in line with our business

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,759
strategy we wear a lot of different hats

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
in the osmo

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
comcast as they relate to open source of

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,360
course one of the big roles

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
that we play are creating and

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,080
maintaining an open source

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,600
culture inside our organization our team

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,639
spends a lot of time making sure

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,280
projects that we

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,040
release which we think are tier one

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,360
projects like we think they'll be very

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,880
popular and used across the community

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
are working well and that they have

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,280
healthy communities

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,120
we help market them we help promote them

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
and we try to keep the communities

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
engaged

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,680
we also serve as the first go-to go-to

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
group for any questions related to open

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,120
source licensing

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,720
how to contribute back to open source

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,639
and any other inquiries

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,120
as they relate to open source from our

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
community

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
awesome that's that's that's a great

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,280
deep dive description there and and

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,560
nigel's we introduced you you helped get

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,280
the ospo going

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,039
at disney and you know probably in your

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,800
time there you even saw all sorts of

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,160
peer organizations getting osmos going

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,240
at the same time

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,800
why do you think we've seen a growth in

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,720
ospos over these last few years

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
yeah that's a great question and i think

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,039
you know what we've been seeing over the

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
past few years is

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,000
is really a blurring of the boundaries

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,240
between proprietary and internal

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,759
software and external and open software

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,520
right i think we're seeing this

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,320
emergence of the community of developers

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,520
you build

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,280
software not necessarily being in

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,199
contained by the walls of your

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,360
organization right if you look at a

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,560
typical application that we've analyzed

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,960
applications at disney typically 80

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
plus of that code came from outside the

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,759
company right it came from open source

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
developers who

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
are creating libraries and reusable

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,280
components so they're getting used in

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,000
applications of the company's building

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
proprietary capabilities around and so

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,520
you know i like to say to people at

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,199
disney um

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,960
hey you know eighty percent of the

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,360
developers don't work for you

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,800
right they're outside and so if you sort

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,080
of take this sort of world view

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,880
of software uh and think about

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,039
um the fact that applications are built

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,160
from a collaboration of developers who

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,000
work for companies

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
your company work for other companies

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
they're just motivated to contribute to

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
open source projects

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,199
um you sort of have to start thinking

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,080
about um

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,560
how you manage that larger engineering

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
team

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,560
right the developers are not all within

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,919
your four worlds they're everywhere

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,880
and there isn't the ability to freely

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
exchange

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
code with those external developers some

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,000
of it's proprietary you want to keep it

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,919
safe

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,520
but other parts of the code you do want

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,199
to contribute and so i think

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,639
open source program offices sort of

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,680
evolve to

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,560
facilitate that engagement with the

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,639
outside world

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,599
right i think you know i think of open

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,080
source program

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,800
officers fulfilling an enablement

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,759
function

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,440
right and we wrote a policy at disney an

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,199
open source software policy

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,880
which sounds like a really scary thing

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,039
to create because uh

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,440
policies usually you know that slap

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,520
people's wrists about doing bad things

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,360
the policy we wrote for disney was

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,199
deliberately focused on

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
enabling developers to do things right

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,680
so we're gonna enable you to do this

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
stuff

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,879
but we're gonna educate you so you can

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,639
take on some of the

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,840
you know the understanding of the risk

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,120
involved in doing that and the open

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,400
source program office is going to be

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
there to help you

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,560
engage with the outside world

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,400
contributing back to

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
the community working with people

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,479
outside of the company but also managing

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,160
risk for the company you can't have

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,319
a sort of throttling function that's

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,599
sort of constraining every single commit

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
people are making to a source code

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,080
repository

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,479
that's not going to work it doesn't

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,319
scale uh particularly in a company the

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,800
size of comcast or disney

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,520
so i think companies are recognizing

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,759
that

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,639
um they are part of a larger community

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,160
of software

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,319
and they need an open source program

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,319
office to enable that to work well

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
um you still have to manage risk this

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,560
isn't you know a free-for-all

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,479
but you also have to recognize that open

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,039
source is enabling technology

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
and and it can be made better by

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,320
companies engaging with the outside

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,959
world as most companies do these days

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,880
right it's

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,479
rare to find a company that's basically

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,479
said we're not going to engage with the

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,720
outside world with open source software

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
that's a you know a failing proposition

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,480
for a business

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,000
awesome that's a great point there and

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,200
and others is you have questions

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,120
please put them in the chat we're going

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,399
to try to incorporate them into the

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
panel here

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,160
but i want to double click a little bit

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,680
you talked a bit about developer

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,360
empowerment and i think there's sort of

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,920
an underlying tone of culture

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,839
change that's a part of that and i know

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,959
you know sheila both you and nigel

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,640
have seen this in action um like give us

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,560
examples like talk about

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,920
what an osvo has done and how you've

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,959
seen this happen

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
in your organizations

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,839
sure i can take this one um so prior to

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,279
our open source program office existing

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
i mentioned you know i have been with

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,200
the company for a long time

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
and i remember that our engineers had to

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
talk with our legal team

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,519
and fill out a long form in order to get

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,680
an open source contribution approved

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,760
so this can potentially cause friction

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,839
between our developers and sort of make

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,279
it less easy for them to contribute back

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,680
upstream

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,640
i've heard rumors at other open source

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,640
conferences

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,399
that some companies had had to fax forms

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,519
to their legal team to get approved for

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,680
oss

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,760
um so this process can obviously take a

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
lot of time and potentially cause a lot

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
of friction

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,040
our ospo one of the big culture chains i

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,760
think changes that we made

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,600
um we're trying to make the process dead

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,440
easy for our technologists to contribute

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,040
back to open source and we're always

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,040
tweaking and looking at new ways to

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,120
improve this process

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,079
another area where i see a lot of

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,000
culture change is around inner source

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,440
this is when you're taking open source

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,279
practices and development

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,519
and applying them inside of your

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,360
organization inside of your firewall so

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,640
you act as if it's open source

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,320
but it's really internal and this also

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
brings a lot of culture change into the

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,120
company when you work at a big company

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,600
or large

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
enterprise like ours it's almost a given

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
that you're going to see teams doing

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,240
duplicated work

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,959
or you'll see teams working on similar

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,640
projects or teams may even be siloed and

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,000
not on purpose only because they don't

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,399
really know

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,480
who to talk to or where to go so

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,279
promoting the culture change of opening

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,360
up repos

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,440
and practicing collaboration right at

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,519
the forefront internally

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
has been a big step towards making that

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,279
big change on the organization and we're

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,560
super thrilled about that

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,000
awesome and nigel it sounds like that

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,519
speaks to the development empowerment

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,160
that you referenced as well i don't know

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,519
if you wouldn't even

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,440
come on back to sheila or even address

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
that yeah no i mean she'll

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,320
raise some really good points and it's

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,760
kind of interesting that the open source

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,120
program at disney actually came out of

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,440
an inner sourcing initiative

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,880
right we recognized that what worked

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,320
well in the outside world in the open

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,600
source community could also work

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
internally the

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,440
company of you know several hundred

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
thousand employees

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
you know looks a lot like the open

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,160
source community and so

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,040
let's facilitate the use of open source

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,680
practices

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,200
and and processes within the company and

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,600
so we started out

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,920
with this developer productivity idea

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
around connecting developers and sharing

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
code

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,079
uh and out of that came this sort of

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,360
observation that like well that's great

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,720
we can collaborate really well

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,639
internally now but

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,639
we're not doing as well with the outside

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,959
world let's fix that problem so

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,320
i think that culture change kind of came

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,320
from a desire

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,360
to really be more efficient internally

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,600
and that kind of

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
set up the theme of developer

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,880
empowerment in in the initiative

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,040
i think the other thing that was sort of

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
interesting when i was forming the open

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,399
source program

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,440
i gathered a bunch of people together

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,200
and

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,360
you know talked about contributing code

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
to the outside world and

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,560
a patent lawyer came up to me and said

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
we can't do that

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,720
right you know every line of code is

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,720
sacred and there's you know

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,240
there's the ip we can't possibly release

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,279
that and so

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,600
part of the culture change that they

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,200
had to leave disney through was really

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
educating people about

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,519
well you know not all code is is super

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,279
sensitive and sensitive for proprietary

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
ip some of it is it's just kind of

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,399
ordinary boilerplate stuff

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,959
you know there's no problem uh we need

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,000
to be careful obviously about reducing

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,839
patented algorithms into uh open source

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,880
software and negating the value of that

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,480
pattern but

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,279
that's why we have a cross-functional

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,720
group of people

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,399
involved in the open source program

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
office and the same same is true i'm

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,000
sure

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,000
comcast which is getting all these

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
diverse opinions but

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,519
part of the sort of mission of the open

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,639
source program office is really about

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,880
education right and

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,000
i think we we sort of undersold that a

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,120
little bit at the beginning

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,560
of the ospo at disney was well we're

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,000
like well we'll just build it and people

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,680
will come

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
but we actually had to go educate people

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,519
and that involved talking to lawyers and

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,880
patent attorneys and security people and

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560
developers in engineering you know we

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,240
went across the whole company

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
really bringing people up to speed and

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
that culture change

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,079
kind of took over a life of its own in

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,720
fact that patent attorney who was you

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,720
know against

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,240
releasing any line of code became the

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,920
strongest advocate for the open source

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,519
program office right he was we didn't

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,000
dare to do marketing just hired him to

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
do it he was awesome

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,519
that's awesome and just looking in the

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,959
chat here uh josh reminder who leads the

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,720
open timeline oh project

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,399
um i think is plus one in your efforts

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,560
there nigel um he's

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,920
you know he's uh been worried he's been

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,519
working a lot to help get

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
some internal processes going there and

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,160
i think some of the early work that

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,000
you've done there has certainly

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,320
helped that out and it certainly helps

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,160
out a lot of developers that

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
they just want to contribute they have

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,720
great things that they're wanting to do

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
they know their organizations are

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
leveraging

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
open source and they want to give back

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,760
um and

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,000
it's it's great to be a part of starting

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,279
that pieces of that culture change

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,320
um as a part of it for sure um

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,800
so i know we talked about ospose in the

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
sense

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,839
of internal facing but then there's also

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,760
the concept

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,279
of opening up development and

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,360
opening up things that are happening

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,079
internally and that is

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,040
often just a whole other bridge to

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,320
tackle there

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,639
i'm sure you both have had some great

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,040
experiences in this tell us a little bit

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,800
about

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,240
what's that like and how the role of an

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,360
ospo can come in there to really help

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,160
sure um so back i guess i'll kind of

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,480
touch back on the developer empowerment

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,000
one of the things and it's it's i'm not

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,560
even quite sure if all

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
ospos do this i've talked to a few folks

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,279
where they do

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,120
um but one of the ways where we're

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,240
looking to enable and empower our

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,199
developers

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,000
again is encouraging them to write blogs

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,000
or

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,880
on our internal open source website or

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,920
get an article out on opensource.com

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,199
um a lot of times our processes

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,279
and our technologies haven't really been

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,639
shared across the community and so we

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
work closely with our corporate

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,600
developers

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,560
development team in addition to the

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,720
legal team for

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,320
you know open sourcing stuff we also

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
work with our corporate development team

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,320
to try to

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,800
persuade and help help get our story out

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,600
there

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,240
and of course with all the approvals we

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
also do

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,480
interview a technologist series to help

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,120
get their name out in the community

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,680
but one of the things we do externally

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,279
since you

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,120
since you mentioned public and

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,399
transparent and open source

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,480
is we also help them sometimes even put

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,360
in abstracts for conferences

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,880
so if people don't have a particular

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,880
open source contributions

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,120
but they're a huge consumer of open

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,560
source we also encourage them to share

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,199
that story out with the community

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,920
whether it's

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,120
out at a conference or on opensource.com

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,959
blog

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,000
or any other medium.com or

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,000
other other blogs

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
yeah i just want to pick up on the

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,040
working with the outside world

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,800
kind of element of this um you know we

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,519
have in the ospo at disney we

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,880
we have a release process for releasing

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,199
disney developed ips

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,720
as open source projects and so teams

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,639
usually come to us with

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,800
a request and that's usually associated

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,440
with a source code repository they want

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
us to

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,959
you know vet for approval you know i

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,040
think rob sort of talked about

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,800
you know how you know writing open

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,320
source software kind of raises the bar

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,720
in terms of quality and i

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,360
wholeheartedly agree with that um you

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
know the

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,399
the term good enough get for github you

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,199
know kind of

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,680
applies in this case but uh you know we

00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
had this

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,959
project come to us and they said hey we

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,560
want to release this as open source and

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,600
we said great where's the source code

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
and they're like well we haven't written

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
that yet

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
and we're like well we need the source

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,600
code we can't approve the

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,760
release of the project until you've

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,760
given us some source code to look at

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,360
and they said well we'll come back to

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,240
you in a year with the source code and

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,720
we're like

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,240
well wait a minute why don't you build

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,919
it in the open

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,199
right why don't you actually since

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,400
you're going to release it anyway why

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
not start open

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,919
and and work with the community to build

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,640
it especially since you're

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,160
looking to drive an open standard um

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,000
have the community

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
engage with you from the very start

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,600
rather than creating this really

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,280
shiny object internally and then

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,520
releasing it fully formed into

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,799
into the outside world and we ran into

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,880
this problem

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,280
uh her son actually we were releasing a

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
3d virtual world as open source and we

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,240
we made this announcement to the open

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,440
source community that we released

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,960
version 1.5

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,679
in in october and october rolled around

00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
and

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,200
you know nothing happened between that

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,640
announcement in october right nobody

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
engaged at all they were waiting for

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,440
this fully formed object to get released

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,960
and

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,320
and so when we released it they were

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
everybody was disappointed because we

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,480
hadn't delivered all the things we said

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,039
we were going to deliver

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,600
and so we kind of realized that open

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,720
source

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,799
engaging with the open source community

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,600
works a different way than you know

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,200
um enterprise software and so we had

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
those little mindset shift they had to

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,360
happen

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,039
and so i think part of the role of the

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,720
ospo is to kind of educate developers

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,559
that it's okay to work in the open

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,480
right you actually can work with the

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,919
community especially if you're looking

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,440
to shift uh

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,280
you know away from proprietary

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,480
technologies to more open ones and

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,440
you're trying to establish an open

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,720
standard and open implementation

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,080
absolutely absolutely and there's a

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,360
great conversation that's happening in

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,480
the chat as we speak here

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,360
um rob completely i think everybody was

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,400
plus wanting

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,240
of working upstream is just a huge

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,919
time saver for communities and i think

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
that's always one of the

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,280
the big selling points of getting

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,120
involved upstream is not having to

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,799
manually integrate your changes

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,160
um and you know not just letting other

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,880
people take advantage of them but just

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,039
saving your own time internally um and

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,039
there's a great also discussion there

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,919
and some of the work that larry gritz

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,280
has done uh around open shading language

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,200
of just starting

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,280
out in the open and getting everyone

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,400
involved sort of that way so so already

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
you know being an internal focus is

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
saying hey you know we're not we're not

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
starting any of this internally and then

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,919
doing a big code dump

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,760
we're starting you know commit one out

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,760
in the open and beginning

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,960
um and and i think that's a really

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,360
fascinating um

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,320
you know way to approach it um you know

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,799
we certainly want to get

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,480
you back from the audience um this is a

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,039
very open session so people can take

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
themselves

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,480
off mute and maybe i'll just give a

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,840
quick moment here um i have more

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,200
questions but i want to have audience

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,480
questions more than anything

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,080
somebody wants to take themselves on

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
mute and ask a question of one of our

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,840
panelists

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,840
um give a few moments if you want to

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,039
um in large companies i'm curious if you

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,799
guys

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
because you both have experience in such

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,840
big companies if you have any

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,360
ideas for further streamlining

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,720
that office and you talked about not

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
becoming the bottom line which is always

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,600
tricky

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,440
you know when you think about it from a

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,640
perspective even inside of disney

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,039
where you've got all these different

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
divisions and normally a lot of layers

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,159
of management

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,919
and maybe some intercompany layers

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,480
between the the

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,320
the office that is strategizing this and

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,240
and the people that are doing the work

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,679
um in the various departments of the

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,280
various businesses

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,440
do you have any good suggestions or have

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,360
you seen models that make it

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,200
feel more streamlined or speed up the

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,440
process um

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,520
especially large companies oh you bet

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,120
and we made a mistake at disney in the

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,720
way that we established the open source

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,720
program office we thought well be great

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,200
you can centralize this function right

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,559
and

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,159
there'll be one instance of the open

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,919
source program office you won't have 27

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,679
of them across the company and

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,200
that's great we can have you know

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,240
consistent reviews and all that kind of

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
stuff all these benefits

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,159
come out of it and of course it became a

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,600
bottleneck right and so

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,280
we found that a lot of the business

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
users were saying we see your open

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,360
source program office we're going to do

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
our own

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,600
and and that that was kind of the

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,039
opposite we wanted to achieve we wanted

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,799
to establish standards around open

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,520
source and so

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,200
um you know the change that that we were

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,280
looking to make with that and i think

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
it's ongoing at disney is is really

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,400
federating out

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,440
the responsibility for open source

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
approval

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,200
granting the business units the um

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,520
ownership

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,640
of those reviews and approvals so they

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,120
can actually be

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,799
can scale much better you know one of

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,400
the things we discovered was that and

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,200
this is true of a lot of technology that

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
came out of pixar and iim lucasfilm was

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,240
that

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,480
the people who were looking to release

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,360
suffer or contribute

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,960
we're working in areas is quite esoteric

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,799
and the open source program office had

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,080
no clue what this technology was right

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,520
because they were just formed from

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,320
people from corporate and other business

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,159
units that didn't

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,720
weren't involved in in in a movie visual

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,080
effects

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,960
and so it made more sense to have

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,320
the uh people in those organizations run

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,240
the reviews for the people in their

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,400
organizations right and so i think we

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,360
we have to figure out a way of making

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,480
sure that

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,440
you know the standards were um uh being

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,440
complied with

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,039
across the organization without being

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,240
big brother and auditing people

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,000
right so i think this sort of this

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,280
notion of federating and educating

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,520
people and allowing them to take on

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,919
responsibility for their own reviews

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,799
works well the other thing we discovered

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,720
was that um

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,559
a lot of the developers who were coming

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,799
to us were actually more knowledgeable

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,880
the open source program office members

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,640
in open source and so we're like well

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,679
why are you coming to us for review what

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,520
can't we make you

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,440
a certified open source developer and

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,880
give you that responsibility so i think

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,679
there's unless it goes back to the

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,080
education component again

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,919
yep and from the comcast side i think

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,120
the ambassador program was really

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,159
helpful for us

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,200
we started by because we're a small

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,679
team and we have all these technologists

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,480
we decided to find one ambassador from

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,520
each

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,400
uh each location and then have them

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,280
represent

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,200
the ospo and we give them quarterly news

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,919
and we keep them updated on what's going

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,240
on

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
um one of the things um so we we haven't

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,720
run into the obstacle where

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,480
folks want to spin up their own ospo in

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,720
other areas but the ambassadors have

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,559
been huge um we also

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,960
one of the other ways we streamlined our

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,200
process and we're continuing to streak

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,360
uh to tweak is that we have online

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,960
reviews for upstream contributions like

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,760
documentation or minor

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,840
features and bug fixes and these

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,840
contribution requests actually get

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,840
reviewed pretty much that day and they

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,880
get approved really fast

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,559
so that's been awesome one of the

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
usually it takes a little bit longer if

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,679
you have a brand new project that wants

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,279
to get released or if you have very

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,880
large features

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,559
and those can take you know typically

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,159
around two weeks just depending on the

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,200
scope of the contribution

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,039
but the online reviews and um you know

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,480
getting getting the reviews in faster

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,480
has been really helpful for us

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,240
that's awesome that's awesome um any

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,720
other questions from the audience here

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,720
we have a couple minutes left and i i

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,080
know this is a new topic a new concept

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,480
for many of you so i want to let you

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,279
kind of hit the experts here

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,880
i have a question about licenses and

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,000
there's sort of um

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,520
maybe some uncertainty or doubt around

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,320
some of the like gpl license or

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,159
you know whether uh corporations can

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,080
like contribute or even use some things

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,919
with the viral licenses

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,240
do you guys have sort of guidance or or

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,000
sort of thoughts on telling people like

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,760
well is there a rule of thumb of like

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,679
when is that appropriate to use and when

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,080
is it not

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,919
absolutely i'll jump in and then nigel

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,159
i'll let you let you take the rest we

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,960
actually have a couple folks on our team

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,720
who focus on licensing and compliance

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,240
and they work very closely with our

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,960
legal team to put together

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,200
different processes and faqs in place

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,799
for what licenses should be used

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,520
and we make sure to share that with our

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,720
community and keep them updated

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,640
yeah and at disney we

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,159
you know essentially classified open

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,799
source licenses as

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,279
you know pre-approved no no approval

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,880
needed

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,400
go ahead as long as it hasn't been

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
hacked uh

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,520
licenses that were kind of dubious and

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,600
required

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,120
context in order to get approval and the

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,799
gpl ones typically fell into that

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,000
category and then there were radioactive

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,080
licenses that

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,279
you know we'd never never touch because

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,400
of the uh

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,640
the impact on um

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,480
uh leaking of ip from within the company

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,279
as a result of using uh software

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
with those licenses so we did that we

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,039
also

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,720
um established uh guidelines on each

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,720
like open source licensing

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,159
in our github repository so develop and

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,840
go directly there and see what

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,840
what they have to do for any given

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,919
license because uh attribution

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,279
requirements for example for area across

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,559
open source licenses we want to make

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,360
sure the developers are enabled so we

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,760
put the information right in their hands

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,360
but i think you know part of my mission

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,559
at disney is to eliminate the open

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
source program office a little bit

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
controversial but i

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
essentially want to get rid of all the

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,240
people right and the more that i can

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,279
automate

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,880
with tools and all and pre-approvals the

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,720
better because

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,720
it's the esoteric questions the open

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,559
source program office really adds value

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,360
and those questions require people with

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,600
experience

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,840
and representation from across the

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,400
company so it's like automate the

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,600
the drudgery streamline that and make

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,279
things more efficient

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,200
but make sure that we are catching the

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,760
kind of gray areas where there's

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,240
this complexity that needs exploring

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,080
cool

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,760
as someone in the disney organization i

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,400
would love to see that list we

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,520
were confused about it and have not not

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,840
seen that

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,720
that guidance so i think if that

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,120
guidance is meant

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,480
exactly for folks like us some some kind

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,240
of barriers there that we should we

00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,960
should um cut down so i will be sending

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,200
you an email

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,720
happy to help you with that and all the

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,919
but the presenter's contact information

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
is right on this slide here

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,200
um so definitely feel free to reach out

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,600
to them we are

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,960
just we are just hitting time here um

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,080
and i want to be cognizant of our next

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,120
presenter here

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,559
i want to thank um both sheila and nigel
