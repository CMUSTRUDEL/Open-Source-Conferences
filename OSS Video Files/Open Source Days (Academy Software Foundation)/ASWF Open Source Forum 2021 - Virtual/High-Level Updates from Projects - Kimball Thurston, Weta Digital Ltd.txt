i guess i will uh get started um

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,840
so so yeah so uh i'm gonna give a a

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,440
a very very high level um update on all

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,839
the projects so it would take

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,640
um by far too long to dive into super

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,600
details

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,640
but um if if i gloss over something that

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,279
you have a

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
burning desire to know about then please

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
um pop in a question or something like

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
that

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,960
uh and so um i i snuck in a

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
a seventh project uh on on rob there but

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
and i'll talk about that in a little bit

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,360
but

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,239
um but one of the things that i'm going

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,000
to try to

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,879
sort of go back and forth on um

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
in a not totally random order but

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,879
certainly not

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,960
particularly ordered um uh set

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,079
is is threading between the projects and

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
the working groups

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,199
and hopefully by by doing this we can we

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,960
can kind of

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,239
see some of the trends that we've

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,680
noticed

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,280
in that the the

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
having these projects be part of the

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080
academy software foundation has has

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,760
really given which

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
you know and and some of this rob

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,360
alluded to with some of the common

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
patterns about build and documentation

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,240
these sorts of

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
things um you know some of it's just

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,880
even visibility it's

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,240
the fact that we have uh icons for

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,520
uh for for these projects um

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,439
but it's also the community and

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,560
knowledge sharing and so hopefully

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,560
people will start to get a feel for for

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,840
how how both the projects and the

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
working groups um

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,000
really help uh build this community

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,000
which i think is super neat

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,680
so um i thought i would start where we

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,520
all started um

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,360
which was with openexr um opening xr

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
uh of course had had gone through a

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,920
period of

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,200
um quietness um

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,880
and then with the with the

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,439
start of the academy software foundation

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,280
it's it's had a vibrant revival

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:06,840
um most recently um we've been

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,640
uh updating to that to that new uh

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,280
common uh legal agreement that that rob

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,400
talked about which is the that that i

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
believe that

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,120
after all the projects finish updating

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,920
we'll have all the projects on the same

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
basic license contributing license

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,040
agreement

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,520
um which is super awesome because it

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,080
makes

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,720
makes it easier for corporations to to

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,040
know how to contribute

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,959
the other thing that has been really

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,160
great about

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,200
the the exr sort of recent work um

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,480
has been with

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,680
getting all of these build uh ci

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,840
practices in place we've also integrated

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,840
with the

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,200
oss fuzz project uh

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,800
that's that's run by google and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,200
that uh has really increased

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,200
the the stability and and security for

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,599
that matter of the openexr project

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,080
and you know when you have a project

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,599
like open xr running as a component in

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
an operating system

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
uh it needs to be secure and it needs to

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,120
you know not

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,120
not allow uh random

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,760
bad actors to to do to to take over your

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,879
your system and so

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,120
that's been a really great um uh

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,959
thing that that has sort of flowed

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,360
through the project in the last period

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,360
of time

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,760
currently we're we're working on uh

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,159
releasing open exr 3.0

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
and i should say that opening xr 3.0 is

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,640
really splitting the project into two

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,680
pieces

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,480
um the there's the imath

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,879
library which is becoming its own first

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,440
class citizen

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,560
and becoming a top level uh separate

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,280
repository

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,280
and that will

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,680
that will sort of help reduce the amount

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,439
of code duplication that's happened over

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,959
the past period time where people have

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
in order to not have a full dependency

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,760
they've ended up

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
copying in portions of the of the code

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,879
and so

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,000
several of the other projects have sort

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,959
of uh um

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,639
committed to undoing that and and going

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,680
back to using just imath with the super

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
repo

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,440
um and we we have some performance

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,199
improvements that we're hoping to

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,080
release by siggraph

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,120
um and we're always looking for for new

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
uh contributors

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,880
uh carrie was there anything i missed

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:42,560
no i think that covers it

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:47,360
right and i'll keep moving on then uh

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,040
so uh yeah i uh

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,560
want to switch to sort of go back and

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,400
ping pong between working groups

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,919
and projects and so

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
the next one would be the diversity

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,520
inclusion stuff i see

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,520
carol in here and i i'd actually prefer

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,280
carol talk to this because

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,720
she does a way better job than i do in

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,720
terms of talking through all of the

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,160
initiatives and things that they

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,639
um they have going on so carol if you

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,400
could

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,759
um yeah thanks kimball um and thanks rob

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
for the introduction to the group

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,919
earlier

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,840
um it's been a whirlwind six months uh

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,360
plus a little bit more with this group

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
um and

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
we're really excited because we're

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,560
finally uh launching a couple of

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
initiatives that we've been working on

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,560
for those six months it was a lot of

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
um and by the way sorry i should

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,639
introduce myself i'm carol payne i work

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,320
for netflix as an imaging specialist

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
and i'm the co-chair of the diversity

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,720
and inclusion working group

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,360
with rachel rose who's r d supervisor at

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
ilm um so i'm representing both of us

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,880
today and

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,880
our entire group of consistently about

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,080
25 to 30 people that we have in our

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,479
monthly meetings

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,360
that range from all different areas of

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,880
the industry

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,479
from contributing uh developers to the

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
aswff projects

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,880
marketing communications hr we have some

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
people that have joined from

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,280
universities that are interested in

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
furthering

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,360
open source efforts for their students

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
so it ranges from all of those

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,120
all those things and we're working on a

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,240
couple things

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
high level our goals are within the aswf

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
diversity inclusion inclusions what we

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
what can we

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,280
be doing to uh look and

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,639
be as diverse as the world is

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,600
and secondly that ties into to guidance

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,199
for members

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,039
we have lots of great member companies

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,080
that are all working hard on similar

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,840
initiatives

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,039
how can we be on the same page and

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,960
be a resource in that area for

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,280
individuals and for companies

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,720
and thirdly where a lot of the

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
initiatives we've been able to get off

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
the ground lies in student education we

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,520
did some surveys early on

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,960
asking folks in the group in the aswf

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
where they thought we should focus our

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,560
efforts and that primarily landed

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,039
on investment in younger students

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
late high school early college of you

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,720
know working to say

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,840
okay let's introduce open source a

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
little bit earlier and

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,800
what it ties into the our industry and

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
visual effects animation and

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,479
entertainment in general and lay that

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,400
foundation of you can get involved now

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,080
you can start using these tools that are

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,560
open source now

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,080
and that we're launching that with our

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,160
webinar series it started

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,080
uh february 25th we've had two so far

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
and those are career focused so we did

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
an intro to aswf

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
and open source and then we're focusing

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,800
on different careers in our industry

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,240
um and sort of tying that back into how

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,440
they use open source they're doing

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,560
software developers

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,800
pipeline td's and color science is one

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,599
and a couple other things and we hope to

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,199
continue

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,400
that initiative because we know we're

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,360
only scratching the surface there

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,440
working on a couple of other things that

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,280
are cool as an open source framework

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
adobe has some cool proposals that

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,039
they're putting through

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
and we're going to work with them to

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,560
make sure that that

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
that framework that could be just a

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,240
whole framework for my company wants to

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,960
do diversity inclusion and make it more

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
of a part of

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,879
our holistic part of our company how do

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,000
we do that and what is a framework with

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,960
which we could start with

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,160
or just sanity check what we're doing in

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,639
a lot of ways

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,440
um and then scholarship and internship

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,840
programs

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,120
are sort of self-explanatory i don't

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,440
want to take too much time

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
i know we're a little bit i've got a lot

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000
to cover today

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,080
but look forward to those um this summer

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,640
and for more info on all those

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,200
initiatives soon

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
thanks everyone amazing thank you carol

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,720
all right continue onward um

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,680
so uh the next next project i want to

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,360
mention as

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,080
open shading language um they

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,120
are just now sort of going through the

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
process and they've officially

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
transitioned over to the

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,399
academy software foundation github some

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,760
of the things that they're

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,880
they're working on um is the

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,399
uh is osl running on the gpu

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,040
and and merging in

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,640
the intel pixar collaboration for for

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,920
batch 70 processing

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,480
um a bunch of other memory optimizations

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,360
just as a brief highlight of what

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,399
they're they're looking at

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,959
and and you'll see sort of i have

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,680
i put the cli best practices in here

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,959
that's

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,920
something that we put in as a

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,120
requirement for the projects is the

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,120
the cii badge

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,200
thing which has a number of metrics in

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,600
terms of

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,600
good code management

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:05,839
and and so there's projects that have

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,839
different statuses through that um

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,800
uh next one i thought i'd mention is the

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,320
usd working group

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,440
uh this one is uh

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
sort of uh the goals around it are sort

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,560
of

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
more uh community focused than actually

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
particularly project focused

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,600
uh as you know the usd project's still

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,000
quite quite quite active

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,839
thanks to pixlr uh but we thought it

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,720
would be really good to have a group

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
that can help

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,560
uh community members with issues and

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,079
sort of help

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,560
spread some of the knowledge base and

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,680
best practices and these sorts of things

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,800
and so corey uh from

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,880
uh pixar helps run this and

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,200
uh and the thing that they're

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,640
actively doing is maintaining a wiki and

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,320
knowledge base

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,519
and have a uh there have been some kind

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,640
of neat things that have come out of

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,800
this already

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,800
one of which is a super neat jupiter

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,000
notebook integration with usd so you can

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
have sort of

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
live web pages and interact with

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
interact

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,839
with usd which one of the guys

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,079
contributed

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,040
and then it's also spawned some sub

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,959
working groups

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,600
where uh various people are talking

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,279
about cameras and rigs and

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,040
pumas and other people are talking about

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,839
web visualization and so

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,920
it's starting to help uh grow a vibrant

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,120
community where people can talk about

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,160
about their experiences so that's

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,160
that's pretty neat to see

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,920
um racing along um uh

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,200
openvdb uh and

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,120
this one uh is is quite active

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
uh i i personally think they've been

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,399
padding their numbers on the

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
on the lines of code changed but you

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,600
know i won't say anything

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,480
um but no i'm i'm joking but uh

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
so they they do a ton of work and

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
they've been

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,800
um really pioneering some of the

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,760
the build practices they have and that

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
that

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
other projects are learning from in

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
terms of managing version symbols and

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
these sorts of things to try to make the

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,519
library

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,440
uh more portable over time

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,360
but some of the the technical goals that

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,920
they're working on you can see here

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,880
uh where there's a new nano vdb thing

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,160
that is focused

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,800
on the gpu which uh can

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,680
should be um i don't know if he's here

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,720
but um

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,040
but the uh the he's working on that and

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
they're also been incorporating all of

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,800
the ax

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,639
stuff uh which is again just another

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,399
example where

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
once vdb moved in the academy software

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,440
foundation that that neutral forum thing

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
enabled

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,480
other people to start contributing

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,480
really neat tech to the project

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,279
and then they're also working on some

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,760
some other things around tiles and

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,839
performance improvements and and and and

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,839
build processes

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,600
the ci group rob talked about a bit as

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,040
being sort of a core

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,959
tenant and technically this isn't

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,000
actually a working group right now which

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,600
is something that we're actually going

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to i think address here in the short

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,480
term

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,800
and which will increase its visibility a

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,519
little bit but it is sort of a backbone

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,240
um component uh behind what a lot of the

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:34,639
early days of the tech

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,360
were about and the goal the stated goals

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
are sort of

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,360
uh to to to share build scripts and

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,639
recipes and

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,120
and and and all this these kinds of

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,920
things

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,199
so that people can repeat this stuff uh

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
to reduce duplicated effort

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,399
provide reference builds and

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,040
one of the things that we've been able

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,160
to to do as part of the aswf

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,880
is actually have a docker hub account

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,480
such that we can avoid throttling and i

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,680
mentioned this only because

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,760
when you have ci scripts where you when

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,360
you push a merge request it runs

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,560
a uh the build and runs

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,079
your unit tests uh you can run into a

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,920
scenario where your project's actually

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,920
being throttled because you're you're

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,959
trying to download docker containers to

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,519
to load your project dependencies um and

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,519
so it's been really great to

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,079
have our have rci prod the ci builds run

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,720
run at full speed um and so so that's

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,399
great

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,959
and so more recently some of the things

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,480
they've been talking about are

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,440
package dependency management

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
some of the studios sort of presenting

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
what

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,120
they have in that space um and looking

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,639
at

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,480
at um the impact of how

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,800
the changes to the centos release model

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,279
uh may impact

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
that and and really trying to tie

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,399
together with the visual

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,880
of the vfx reference platform um and

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,639
and what the implications are of that

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,959
and so trying to provide

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,000
active technical knowledge for for

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,160
making decisions around

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,160
that

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,360
next project to keep moving along uh

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,639
open color i o

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,240
uh this project

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,519
uh also has had a huge uh influx of

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,759
support from autodesk coming on as

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,120
a primary contributor and and

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,880
contributing

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,440
an immense amount of code for for

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,000
version two a whole

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:49,040
whole new setup and it's uh it's really

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,600
quite impressive uh they're they're

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,320
working on on all the asus reference

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,880
configs and studio configs and and

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,040
really starting to work on the user

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,279
experience

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,480
and one of the things that i thought i

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,240
would spend

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,240
just a brief second and talk about uh is

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,800
the the documentation and work that uh

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
autodesk coming in as a as a dcc vendor

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,600
sort of

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,279
values documentation and and um

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,839
and making that be a a sort of a

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,120
first-class part of the project and so

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,720
one of the things they did

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,519
as as part of of this work was uh come

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,040
up with a new

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,079
uh system for for blending

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,680
or or at least maybe it's not new new

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,880
but new to us anyway um

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,920
blending uh sphinx traditional sphinx

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,880
documentation

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,079
with uh doxygen induction oxygen

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,120
documentation

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,399
and and i hopefully this sort of

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,680
isn't the text is less important but

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,920
you know some of the real benefits of

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,680
that is it really allows you to have a

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,880
consistent uh documentation page where

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,559
you can have stories and and and

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,199
and just traditionally written text

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,480
intertwined with your actual api

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,000
documentation

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,839
uh and as well as as merging

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,559
both the python documentation and and

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:24,160
the sql plus documentation

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,679
and so that's that's uh really exciting

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,319
and i know the other projects are

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,960
looking at this stuff

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,240
and and even some some of the the

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,440
studios are saying hey that's a pretty

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
neat pattern maybe we should

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,880
maybe we should adopt that internally

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,840
too

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,880
and so that's that's a pretty neat uh

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,880
innovation that they've done

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,720
okay well if i can just jump in really

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,320
quick i just think this is a really nice

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,320
story too

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,679
as you were pointing out like exr went

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,679
through a period of less activity

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,120
and now a lot more and this is another

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,559
example of a project that went through

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,360
last activities had

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
key maintainers changed and then even a

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
handoff from

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,679
one primary sponsoring company to

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,640
another and in a really successful

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,840
transparent way where i think

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
everybody's getting a lot of value so

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,679
anyway

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,919
i just love the story of the success of

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,200
open color i o and the amount of

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,880
innovation going into that

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,240
that has really been i don't know if

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,919
that would have happened without

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
the work that the attack had been doing

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,760
and and everyone's confidence that this

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,840
could be um could be could be a nice

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,000
smooth transition from two to three

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,280
so anyway just nice work on that and i'm

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
really glad to be able to celebrate that

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,559
success

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,559
yes definitely thanks rob

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,120
so yeah so the uh

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,640
next i won't say too much about the

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
review approval working group there

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,480
there's

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,480
still um talking to each other

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,280
and and working on um

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,320
identifying uh what it would mean to

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,440
have

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,559
you know a review view and approval tool

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,400
or components of a tool that we could

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,919
share amongst the studios

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,960
and and perhaps even the vendors

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,640
the dcc vendors they've worked on a

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,840
feature matrix and starting gap

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,840
gap and impact analysis

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,679
and this is sort of a trend that you'll

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,400
see is where we're starting the the tech

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,400
is starting to talk about

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
not only providing sort of st core

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,559
structural libraries uh but

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,760
but maybe a little bit more uh

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,799
production-oriented tools um

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,960
it's a fine line to to

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,799
to wind but we're starting to look at

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,600
that and so that's

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,600
that's pretty neat

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,559
open timeline io which would obviously

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,360
be a core component of that review and

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,640
approval

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,440
tool set that

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
has been uh

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
a recent addition to the academy silver

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,120
foundation

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,840
um well i guess it's been been was it

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,880
last cigarette um

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,880
and they're uh working on um

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,400
a whole number of uh initiatives uh

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,880
build consistency and cross-platform

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,640
support is always a thing that all

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,360
projects are working on

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,880
but one of the things that otio is

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,799
really

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
in a way championing them amongst our

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,200
group of projects

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:35,520
is really taking a look

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,520
at multiple bindings for the the library

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,559
so they have you know they have a new uh

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,039
cpus plus

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,320
library that's the kind of the back end

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,640
um

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,240
but they're they're they're looking at a

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,720
new repository system

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
to enable bindings to different

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,640
languages

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,919
to to be and live on their own and and

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,039
manage that

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,039
which is pretty neat to see

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,840
and they're also working on new data

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,520
models and and

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,640
and continuing their cii batch progress

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,880
and graduating to be

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
the full active active project

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,919
which sort of brings me to one of the

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,440
other working groups which is the rust

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,720
working group this is a

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,720
a new uh

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,159
a new working group that uh just got

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,159
approved a couple weeks ago i think

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,159
uh and it uh

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,799
it's an example where peop we

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,159
the individual projects may not have the

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,880
bandwidth to support

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,720
a uh binding to a particular other

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,000
language uh and so

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,000
but there's a lot of interest in that

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,679
language in in the in

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,520
the community and so that they have

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,919
sort of stepped up and said hey we'll

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,039
help build some tooling to expose the

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,520
the c plus interfaces to rust um

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,080
and they're also going to help with sort

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,280
of

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,520
uh apparently not with typos

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,360
but they're going to help with uh

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,960
conventions and consistent patterns

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,840
um but uh and so

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,600
that will be uh really great to sort of

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,240
have this this working group to

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,240
help coordinate across uh through the

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,520
different projects and start to work

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,440
on um having sort of maybe a common

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,000
binding framework such that

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,640
we have more consistent exposure to

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,880
python

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:40,799
or to rust or to any of the other

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:44,400
languages that people are are using

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,480
uh open cue yet another

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,520
uh example of a project that that uh

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
spun out of

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,039
um out

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,679
of our our community and has been

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
adopted

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,960
and is sort of actively being maintained

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,120
uh

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,240
over at uh

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,720
not a studio organization uh

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,080
primarily i guess uh the guys uh brian's

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,360
over at google

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,159
but they are you know similar

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,919
a similar vein to some of the other

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,400
projects where they're working on their

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,600
the asf project graduation um the the

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
cii badge

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,039
progress and they're they're nearly

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,360
complete as well

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,400
and and so we expect that to finish up

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,200
here uh

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,159
in some time early this year but they're

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,799
they're also

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
really starting to look at at user

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,640
experience

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,720
ui revamp and and updating their

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,080
documentation and doing a full refresh

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
on that

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
and and as always working on

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,960
interoperability with

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,960
with input and output

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,480
growth where they're working on

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,600
different or updated dcc

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,919
plugins or external services

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,159
reporting services being able to talk to

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
that

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,640
the um the the next working group i

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
wanted to mention is the python 3

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
working group

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,720
and this one it's currently a little bit

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:18,320
quiet although we expect that to pick up

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,600
here again this year but they've been

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,520
focused on

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,600
helping to provide a transition guide

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,559
and coordinating efforts between

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,039
the studios and the vendors um and and

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,000
really

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,799
acting as a knowledge and experience

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,120
sharing

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:37,919
sort of center where people can come and

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,360
finally get rid of python 2 and switch

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,360
to the new world

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,400
which we're going to be forced to do but

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,840
that's okay

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,840
it's a good thing change is good

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,559
uh and so uh nearly finished uh

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,240
but the the the newest project which

00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,760
just got added and so it hasn't made its

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,440
way onto all the slides

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,120
is radasis and as a side

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,960
joke i will note that this is the only

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,080
project which doesn't have the word open

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,360
in it so

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,520
i don't know how well it's gonna be

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,400
received but

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,520
no no this is uh this is basically a an

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,240
effort to

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
to revive another relatively dormant

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,720
repository

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,400
uh it's uh it's

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,880
uh the the goal of it is to uh

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,960
or the purpose of the tool is to be able

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,559
to convert camera raw files to

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,559
uh asus uh

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,840
spec files and do all the color

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,880
manipulation necessary to do so

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,200
and one of the and

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,640
what is agreed to to contribute some of

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
the code that we have from a tool that's

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,120
internal so

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,880
we're going to use that to revive the

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,799
repository

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,240
we don't have a logo yet um so we have

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,320
to work on that um

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,360
which is one of the the things that we

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,279
can get

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:07,400
benefit from um

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,679
and this will also be uh another sort of

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,799
multi-repository project and so it's

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,279
going to be an interesting thing to

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,279
study

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,640
one is we want to make it a production

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,120
quality tool

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,480
which will of course use opening xr as a

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,840
library

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,279
for example but

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,679
also it will have uh

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,799
camera data sets and this may be almost

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,080
as important as

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,200
the uh the the tool itself um

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,320
in terms of helping to act as a common

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,400
um place for people to to talk about

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,559
the cameras and make sure that we have a

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,360
good color fidelity between all of the

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,880
all of them and how the idt's get built

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,919
to go into asus and these sorts of

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,120
things so that's

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,440
it's pretty exciting to have that on

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,400
board and we'll look to see that to grow

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,880
over the next

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
few months

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,919
um and the final uh working group uh is

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,480
the asset

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,279
uh repository working group it's it's

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,919
also not

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,320
quite an official working group yet but

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,360
we're about there

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,400
and its goals are for

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,039
uh coming up and you see the background

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,919
here is the

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,200
the the disney moana data the moana

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,240
island

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,120
data set that disney very graciously

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,799
contributed to

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,600
to the world um and a big huge shout out

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,399
to them because

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,399
it's serving as a as an example of the

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,960
kind of thing that we're looking to do

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,399
with this

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,559
with this working group and so we're

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,840
working on a strategy for for curating

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,880
and hosting this

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,799
um and hosting these

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
kinds of things and and to not have it

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,520
turning into a

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,440
dumping ground and and so they're trying

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,320
to figure out how to enable curated

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,720
contribution uh but also to to seek out

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,440
and

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,120
and beg for counterreach not big but

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,559
encourage contribution

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,320
um and sort of on multiple levels one

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,320
is uh an educational um

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,440
sort of entry level uh another one would

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,360
be more

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
more complex or production grade uh

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,240
examples of

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,960
of assets and you know this uh

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,320
as a quick side note um sort of will

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,720
benefit

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,159
benefit everyone if we can get a good uh

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,760
framework like this set up

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,399
and and and active um one it'll help

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,000
the from a vendor perspective it'll be

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,640
amazing it'll be data that's

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,520
that's real data um to to use for

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
testing

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,919
but it also will will help um the

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,039
contributing organizations because it

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,559
means they're

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,880
the the software being written against

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:50,000
it will be tested against real assets

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,000
and so that's that's also a huge benefit

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,960
and and so on and so uh

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,559
with that i think i'll wrap up and

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,360
stay on on schedule or etiquette unless

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,919
there's any other questions

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,679
uh maybe we can we can sort of open it

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,720
up to general qa and open discussion

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,840
i'll hand it back to david

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,279
thank you kim both at this point

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,960
if there is any questions for kimbo

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,200
in the the long list of projects and

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,840
activities that the attack has been

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
um has been moving forward um in the

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,320
last

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,159
year that will be the time to ask in a

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,440
more free form fashion

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,679
uh before we move to the to the uh

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,240
the polling where we will ask you some

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,240
more specific questions about the future

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,760
but now if if there's any questions

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,240
about what you've heard now

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
uh question concerns we really want this

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,919
to be

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,559
with our group of our our group of

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,159
friends

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,240
here people who we trust don't hesitate

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,880
to speak up your mind or if you have a

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,760
question about what you've heard

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,760
please go ahead

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,120
and feel free to ask in the chat or just

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,760
unmute and chime in whatever you're most

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,760
comfortable with

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,600
i'll just uh amplify what kimball said

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,279
those of you who are

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,399
here from film studios please think hard

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,559
about

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,000
what assets you wish your software

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,600
vendors had tested against

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,840
before they sent you that last version

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,720
of software that you had to test

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,320
and think about whether there's

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,120
something that that you could contribute

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,320
to the

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,720
asset repository that would help both

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,600
the

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,240
open source projects and the software

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,840
vendors

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,279
and the research community for that

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,559
matter to serve you better

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,799
a really important pitch because the

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,720
existence or not

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,240
non-existence of this project is really

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,919
going to depend on

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,120
whether there's meaningful contributions

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,880
and i'll just share as well um

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,640
from disney animation we shared the

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,720
moana island scene and although it was

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,559
some work to do that um

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,640
uh it's definitely you know more that

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,120
work more than paid for itself in terms

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,720
of

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,080
all the reciprocal uh optimizations and

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,960
examples and i think that that's come

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,279
back to us

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,039
uh and uh you know and it's it's it's

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,720
been a great advantage to us to have

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,960
technology companies and vendor software

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,200
vendors and researchers going out and

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,320
doing work directly based on kind of

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,799
something that's derived from our

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,519
from a real production data so i i i

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,039
it's

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,799
it's not just an altruistic thing it's

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,960
been it's been beneficial to us too

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,039
but it's also we did it because we

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,000
wanted to give back to the community too

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,000
certainly benefiting from it

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,519
thank you um i'll just add from the open

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,720
timeline io perspective

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,360
like having our project join the aswf

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,519
has been

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,440
a really fantastic experience and

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,399
specifically the sort of outreach

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,120
and uh just visibility that the project

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,600
has

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,640
received because of joining the aswf we

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
have contributions from

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,919
lots and lots of people that we

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,799
otherwise would not uh even know that

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,600
they existed so

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,600
it's been great

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,679
i'd like to give a plug for an upcoming

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,960
post on the

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,360
aswf blog that emily olin

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,880
commissioned about the origins of

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,080
openexr

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,240
it's largely interviews with

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,519
florian kinds and rod bogart about the

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,360
inception of open exr at ilm in the late

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,360
90s it's it tells the story of the

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,720
development of the library but also of

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,200
the adoption of

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,000
floating point representations of images

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,720
which

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,600
we take for granted now but at the time

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,600
in the 90s was

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,760
kind of a radical notion so it's an

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,840
interesting bit of history to capture so

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,840
stay tuned for that on the blog

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,240
just even more color to add to the dni

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,960
section that carol and rachel are

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,200
heading up

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,720
there's our member organizations all

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,799
have pretty vibrant

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,000
or either have or developing pretty

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,840
vibrant dna

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,120
inclusion efforts so some i think david

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,399
may talk about this in a little bit too

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,120
or maybe we'll have some discussion

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,840
around it but it sure is exciting to see

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,840
this forum being used as a place where

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,919
successes and techniques and pro

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,440
and and processes that people are using

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,519
or identifying internally they need to

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,799
be revised can be shared so that

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,200
it will help accelerate everyone's

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,080
efforts in that area so i really like
