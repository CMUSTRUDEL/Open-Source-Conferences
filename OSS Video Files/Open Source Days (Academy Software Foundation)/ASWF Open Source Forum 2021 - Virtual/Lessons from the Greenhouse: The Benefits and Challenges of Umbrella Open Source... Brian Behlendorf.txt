Description: 
	Lessons from the Greenhouse: The Benefits and Challenges of Umbrella Open Source Software Communities - Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger

Many open source communities are actually communities of communities - what the LF called "Umbrella" organizations, though on Hyperledger we call it the "Greenhouse". This nesting arrangement has a lot of advantages, but can come with unique challenges as the number of projects and communities within the umbrella/greenhouse grows beyond a handful. Come to hear about the greenhouse-scaling issues Hyperledger has faced and had to overcome, and those that are still vexing.

so i want to shift us over to our next

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,040
speaker brian bellendorf

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,639
uh he is an open source veteran

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,200
uh that has been just passionate about

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,440
open source and free software his entire

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
career um in just so many different

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
capacities

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
uh in this talk he's speaking from his

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,680
perspective um on the executive director

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,279
of hyperledger and this is a a project

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,240
within the linux foundation

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,519
that just turned five i believe here

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,039
recently

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,640
and there's a lot of great stories to

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,640
tell here of

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,399
you know really the progress that that

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,200
foundation is made over time

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,399
and so his talk here is lessons from the

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
greenhouse which we'll learn about with

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,440
the greenhouse here is in a moment the

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,480
benefits and challenges

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,039
of open source software communities

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,760
brian um can i turn this screen over to

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,520
you

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,760
yeah if i i can share here let's see

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,760
uh

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,760
can everyone see that yes all right

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
let me just reopen all the windows that

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,920
disappear when you start uh

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,400
sharing something like that but uh and i

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
uh

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
so thank you very much for allowing me

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,760
to present here let me get my

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,360
timer just kind of close by so i can

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,600
keep us on time um

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,560
i i i yeah thanks for the introduction

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,799
john um

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,400
and uh yes uh this project i've been

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,040
leading at hyperledger since shortly

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
after it was formed in early 2016 just

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
turned five years old it's called

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,680
hyperledger it's an

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,520
enterprise blockchain project it's also

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,520
been a greenhouse from its very earliest

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,159
days i'll actually describe how

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,079
i i forced that as one of the first

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,000
decisions walking into that project

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
because i knew how definitional it was

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,479
going to be for the culture on that

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,079
project

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,000
i'm going to walk you very briefly

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,439
through what we do on the project not to

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,119
sell any of you on it i'm sorry if it

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,880
comes across as a as a pitch

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,040
it's intended to be more like the first

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,000
half of a vh1 behind the music special

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
you know that point

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
that pivot point before it goes and then

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,439
the drama on stage uh

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,439
so off stage started to spill on stage

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,119
the sex the drugs it all took its toll

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,880
you'll you'll find when i hit that point

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,000
because i want to use it as a context to

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,600
say here's some of the

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,520
uh challenges we had some of the

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
interventions that we tried and some of

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,239
the ones that

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
worked and maybe open it up more as a

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
conversation so it'll be a whirlwind

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,360
and apologies if it comes across a bit

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
pitchy but

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
i i should mention that hyperledger now

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,120
is one of a set of projects that i

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,000
oversee as more of a general manager for

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,879
blockchain healthcare

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,800
and identity at the linux foundation um

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,520
so hyperledger itself uh formed very

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,680
much as

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,000
a uh as a as a uh mr uh mr

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
dr jekyll to the mr hyde of

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,840
cryptocurrency

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,360
and icos and all the kind of pump and

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,800
dump scams that have happened around

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,920
around that domain instead it was more

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
about the sober

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,760
application of distributed ledger

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,800
technology and consensus mechanisms and

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,959
smart contracts

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,239
to rather prosaic use cases like supply

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,560
chain traceability

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,640
uh trade finance and other kind of

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,959
financial applications uh

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
digital identity initiatives basically

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
things that have to do with establishing

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,159
a common system of record

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,159
around a cohort a consortium of

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,560
collaborating organizations and

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
i i and in that respect we've had to be

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
a bit uh

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
out there in terms of advocacy and

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,560
explaining the concept you don't have to

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,599
explain the concept of special effects

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,000
software to the world

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,360
people get that uh but enterprise

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
blockchain technology felt like a

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,080
contradiction

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
in terms and so when we started the

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,040
project we didn't have this thing in

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
place called the greenhouse what we had

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
were

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
two projects that are mentioned here a

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,680
project called hyperledger fabric

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,120
which came from ibm originally was very

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,720
much like well if you were to

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,519
take the old transaction processing

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
systems um from mainframes in the 1960s

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,080
and

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
sex them up a little bit and give them a

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,280
modern web services and

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,200
go programming language under

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,920
infrastructure i'm i'm significantly

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,519
discounting

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
the value of what was created in fabric

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,040
it actually is really awesome

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
but it looks about as modern to a

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
cryptocurrency or a bitcoin kind of

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,680
minded

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,239
head as say a mainframe does to even

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,000
people in the pc world in the 1990s um

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,360
but it's there and it's solid and it's

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
very widely deployed

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
but on day one it also had this project

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,959
called sawtooth which was this

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,120
interesting project involving secure

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,000
enclaves and a very different consensus

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,959
mechanism

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,920
written in python a different flavor and

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
character

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,079
to fabric and in some respects you could

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,199
pin it a little bit to some corporate

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,519
rivalry as a

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,639
reason for its existence and walking in

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
with these two projects

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,560
meant uh that it was going to we were

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,960
going to have to make a choice

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,240
were we going to be more like the linux

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,160
linux kernel project

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
where there really is one kernel there's

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
lena's colonel there's

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
you know it's a tree that he takes all

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
these in-flight patches

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
and and and pulls pull requests and

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
pulls them in

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,120
um or is it gonna be more like a united

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,320
nations kind of thing or like the apache

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,240
software foundation which

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,400
i played a role in founding and setting

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
in its course as also a sort of umbrella

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,120
organization

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,479
and so i pulled our crowd i pulled my

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,160
members i pulled

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,840
uh people out there in the in the

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
enterprise blockchain space that i hope

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,000
to

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,440
recruit and pull in and they said you

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
should be an umbrella

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,840
and they said that might be an

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,360
interesting way to make sure that all

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
the good ideas are emerging at this

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
early stage

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,680
in the life cycle of this technology

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,199
movement

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
could find a home and not just those

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,039
that happen to fit in as suitable

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,520
plug-ins or patches to one stack like

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,759
fabric

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,280
right so we pursued approach that said

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
the door is open here's a

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,320
maturity model here's an application

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
process

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
the technical advisory council approve

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,680
it and we decided that

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
a greenhouse metaphor would actually

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,240
make a lot of sense as a way to get

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
across the idea

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,360
that these projects would nurture and

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
and share the

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
nurture each other share the same

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,320
airspace share the same watering

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,840
systems um share the same uh sense of

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,639
you know they're kind of fit together

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,840
in some way um uh uh hopefully

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
optimistically uh

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,080
idealistically um what did emerge over

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
the last uh five years

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
has been six different approaches to

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
building distributed ledgers

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
some of them special purpose like in

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,199
digital identity uh

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,520
some of them based more on the ethereum

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,840
ecosystem like bay zoo and borough

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,680
uh uh and then some that were just kind

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,120
of oddball things whose first big

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,639
deployment was being the central bank

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,720
digital currency for the country

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,160
of cambodia which is what hyperledger

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
iroha is about

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,680
um out of that did emerge a couple of

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,639
different libraries and

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,160
and and tooling that that uh came to be

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,360
some of them came to be applicable to

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
some of the others there's a little bit

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,759
if you draw lines between these the

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
dependencies

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,600
you get a little bit of mix and match

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
but a lot of these are independent um

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,680
and one thing i'll point out

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,800
is that about three years ago well about

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,160
two years ago we launched something

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,199
called hyperledger labs

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,639
as kind of a foundry for new projects um

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,639
uh and that'll that'll come into

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
existence for coming to clarity pretty

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,639
quick

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
i don't want to go into details of what

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
these different projects do i

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
do want to emphasize these are projects

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,319
that are being used in production today

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
by

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,599
this is our nascar slide people

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,759
appreciate that um

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,960
by all these different companies and

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,599
many more obviously

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,440
for core transaction processing systems

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,440
core trade finance and trade

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,520
supply chain tracing systems core

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,160
international efforts as well and a lot

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,319
of

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,560
regulatory required kinds of systems so

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,240
this is this is real production code

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,319
the things that we kind of standardized

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,560
across uh the different hyperledger

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,720
projects from a developer point of view

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,840
was a common ip framework

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,919
i'm sure this is familiar um and license

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,000
of course the uh apache license

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,680
uh common set of collaborative tooling

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
uh github wiki chat

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,520
email is kind of the four horsemen of

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,199
the of the collaborative

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
apocalypse if you want to call it that

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,639
um you know as the way to make all this

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,599
stuff work but really converging them on

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,000
the same thing

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,840
um as well as common branding you know a

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,599
common graphical kind of paradigm you

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,800
saw the logos kind of all fit a certain

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,400
style

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
and promotion of these projects out

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,800
there in a way that we felt would be

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,479
uh fair you know that would be tied to

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
the kind of a duocracy you know if you

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
want to talk about your project publicly

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,440
we'll help you do that

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,440
um as well as a standardized security

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,680
process and practice

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,240
across across all the different projects

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,759
a common way to do cii badging and

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,759
relationship with cert and those sorts

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
of things we also hope to standardize

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,800
the developer culture

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,400
across these different projects a

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,440
culture that said you're building code

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,240
in the open

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,639
none of this kind of private uh branches

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
or

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,160
or repos that then you kind of push

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,720
updates to publicly you know

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,000
stuff you know as often as possible you

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,639
know starts in the open

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,400
and and goes all the way to release um

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,599
that the roadmaps themselves and release

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,479
schedules and those sorts of things

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,639
would be public

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,960
that following certain hyperledger

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
policies like requiring dcos for pull

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
requests and that sort of thing to some

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,680
degree we can automate that

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
but to some degree it requires vigilance

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,240
on the part of developers and the core

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,599
maintainers on those projects as well

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
and then finally wherever possible look

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
to refactor stuff that's common across

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,920
projects into modular code and try to

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,440
strike a tone of appreciative inquiry on

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,959
what other projects you're doing

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,240
and then there's all the the staffing

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,920
and kind of other infrastructure that

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,600
the linux foundation provides

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,120
which i don't have to go into here i'm

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,040
going to give a brief tour because i'm

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,040
sure you guys have this as well in aswf

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,120
but it was really important to us that

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,360
the tooling that gets used is unified

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,680
across these projects with a common

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
developer wiki a common chat system

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,640
which is not slack

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,760
uh we didn't like slack's licensing

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
terms we're using something called

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
rocket chat but we'll probably move to

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
matrix

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,480
pretty soon but where all those projects

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,959
have um you know the same kind of

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
wave modes of engagement call it that a

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,920
unified calendar

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
as well available as an easy to

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,640
subscribe to google calendar links so

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,240
you can

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,519
decide which meetings to join and see

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,279
your meetings related to others

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,880
hopefully avoid conflicts so people who

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,720
are part of two projects can

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,800
can make it to them but but again kind

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
of this this common resource

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
and then across the projects we

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,640
implement us that implemented a set of

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,320
working groups

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,839
some of them more successful than others

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
um some of them

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
uh with a very direct tie to projects

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
others that kind of sit above or to the

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
side

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
uh an overall technical steering

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,519
committee i'm sure you have one of these

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,880
but then working groups around

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,399
architecture identity smart contracts uh

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,080
learning materials basically

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,040
documentation performance and

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,720
scalability

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,720
we also set up a separate group focused

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,440
on the needs of china china's developers

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
to help them get

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
through the the great firewall which is

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,640
not just technical but also cultural and

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,880
language and that sort of thing

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
as well as uh diversity and stability

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,920
and that fun and the like

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,680
and that cross-cutting thing did help

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,279
weave some of these things together

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,959
we also said to meet the business

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,480
community and the business users who are

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,640
still climbing the learning curve on how

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,160
to use these technologies where they are

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,839
it was important to set up special

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,000
interest groups to

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,839
try to talk with them at the level of

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,640
health care use cases or

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,800
climate related use cases and not to

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,519
push a particular platform or solution

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,959
as the

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,640
you know as kind of that you well you

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,399
should then you just use hyperledger in

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,880
the for all your identity stuff right

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
but instead to say um help us understand

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,519
kind of where people have been

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,360
successful using these technologies

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,959
even if it's not hyperledger

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,519
technologies if you're using corda or

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,120
quorum

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,040
like let's learn about that but then

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,760
hopefully out of that become from learn

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,800
some requirements some ideas maybe even

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,640
some new projects

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,399
that spin out and we've had the climate

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,839
group actually generates some of those

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
we did just launch a media and

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
entertainment one i'll draw your

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,680
attention to as

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,600
potentially something interesting um if

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,760
you'd like to join let me know it's

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
thinking about use cases related to ip

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,040
management

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,399
uh and um you know think of it as like

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
decentralizing imdb

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,959
a little bit maybe to be a bit

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,320
controversial here i hope nobody from

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,480
imdb is on the call

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,839
um uh that sort of thing and then we

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,600
brought try to bring everyone together

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
into common events like

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,720
uh so we're running something in june

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,480
called the hyperledger global forum

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
again to try to be this like gathering

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,760
of the tribes uh

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,760
and and on a global basis we've got

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,600
meetups in 70 different countries

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,920
uh all sorts of different cities and

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,880
actually been firing up charter

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,079
sorry chapters in india latin america

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,040
all sorts of things and back when we

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,839
were traveling

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,680
um i did i think loop the the the earth

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,120
four times in 2019.

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,040
um and this is that uh the the vh1

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,720
behind the music special this is the

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
sometimes your greenhouse no matter how

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
big it is or how how

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,279
beautiful it is and not just to cite the

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,079
polyshore

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,880
movie from what was it 2099 and

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,320
something like that

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
um but you know sometimes your

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,200
greenhouse can turn into biosphere 2

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,639
um hopefully not too often and lead to

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,600
some trouble in paradise

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,360
so as you might expect uh when you have

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,160
projects especially when they cover the

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,720
same

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,360
function right serving as your baseline

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
ledger

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
layer which is very much like a database

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,480
right and just as

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,560
you know no one suggests postgres and

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
mysql should merge efforts and become

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,000
just one project

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
uh or if they do that be kind of silly

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
right um

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,040
naturally rivalries emerge between these

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,160
projects with overlapping objectives um

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
particularly when they have different

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,800
origin stories and here's where i try to

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
go into a whole avengers kind of

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,200
metaphor but i will refrain from that

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,639
we also found that developers and

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,959
employer egos for lack of a better word

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,880
market momentum legacy install base you

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,079
know hey we've got hundreds of different

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,000
production systems running

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,160
on you know x we can't really migrate

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,800
them and choice of implementation

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,920
language go versus python versus rust

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
versus c

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,760
those can create barriers to

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,399
consolidating or refactoring projects

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,279
even if the the the will is there the

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
idea is there

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,320
and even if the market is telling you

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,120
that you should probably do that

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
um uh the the greenhouse picture that we

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
painted

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,519
you know which is this nice kind of

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,040
stack um but doesn't doesn't try to

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,000
reflect too much architecturally other

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,240
than kind of the groupings

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
between these it does have some flaws as

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
well it presents all projects as equal

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
in every way

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,480
but projects radically differ in terms

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,959
of their volume of activity

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,040
uh their scope of ambition and the the

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,079
market impact that they're having um

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,680
i i and it also confuses beginners who

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,440
tend to want one true stack

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,120
to be able to look at here's this builds

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,519
up on this builds upon this builds up on

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
this

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,040
and maybe even within a layer maybe

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,240
there's some optionality use a fork

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,399
rather than a knife

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,079
but um but really when it comes to

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,480
helping people out that learning curve

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,279
you know uh it actually as some of you

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
probably know

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,040
um when you force people to make a

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,720
choice and they don't have information

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,199
good information on which to make that

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,760
choice it actually registers the same

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,680
pathways as physical pain so you

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,560
literally are inflicting pain upon your

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
user community

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,160
if you're forcing them to make a choice

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,519
without giving them a lot of very simple

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
information about how to guide that

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
choice

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
there's also two layers of branding

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,760
hyperledger and fabric

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
sometimes people when they say the word

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,480
hyperledger they mean that which then

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,720
can offend

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,000
hyperledger or something else you know

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
and that creates again the sense of

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,199
tension

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,680
and the sense of sibling rivalry and

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
finally

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,720
you know when you're looking at new

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,800
projects coming in it's far easier to

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,199
say yes to a promising idea

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
than to shut down a you know kind of a

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,000
either very sleepy to the point that

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,920
it's kind of moribund

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,600
but not quite good project making the

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
greenhouse more like night of the living

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,199
dead

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,279
at times you know we have a couple

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,040
projects just kind of every quarter you

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,760
know they give their report but

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
um you know you know it's it's it's it's

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,639
not dead but um

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,199
but you can't quite take it out back and

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,800
and retire it so what did we try to do

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
um and this is really my closing side

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,639
then i'll open it up for some some q

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,519
a raising the bar for accepting new

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,160
projects uh

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,120
was kind of key to this uh and um making

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
sure that i

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,399
i you know that there was an existing

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,959
community behind code that there is an

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,959
existing

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,720
set of diverse contributors to that

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,279
there was ideally an already existing

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
repo

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,800
that had been open sourced um and and

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,399
those sorts of things and then if

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,720
something was just a really good idea

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,519
or a weekend hack or somebody wanted to

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
try something

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,720
create the space for that at hyperledger

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,560
labs where it doesn't get the

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,399
the marquee kind of placing next to the

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,000
others where you still give it some

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,720
resources develop a community but you

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
kind of

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,320
let people know hey this is this is

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,920
still not quite ready even for

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,560
new users to come in and try to dive

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,399
into we also

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,000
we started requiring quarterly reporting

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
from projects to the tsc

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
uh so that we had at least this basic

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,600
health uh check and we have a template

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,079
for those reports as well

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,279
and we finally have as of uh last year

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,600
uh early last year

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,800
a great uh set of lf analytics tools be

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,120
able to

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,240
show quantitatively where projects are

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,639
on the right course or not

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,480
um we'd also have tried to facilitate a

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,079
lot of cross-project maintainer

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,680
networking back when we were traveling

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,800
face-to-face we would host

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,160
uh maintainer summits uh with off-sites

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
to axe throwing

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,480
uh kinds of uh uh you know evening uh

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,839
fun events and that throat that kind of

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
thing fortunately uh

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
uh we still have our insurance policy so

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,199
nothing too bad must have happened

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,000
um uh and and then along with that

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,839
trying to drive a real

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
sense among maintainers of common

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,079
stakeholder ship that you're all in this

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
big boat

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,360
all in this big greenhouse you know

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,800
whatever metaphor you want to use um

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,720
we have an obligation to each other to

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,320
try to work together and share the same

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
airspace and water and and

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,240
uh makes sense things make sense to the

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,839
the new user community

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,519
um we also try to focus a bunch of

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,040
marketing on very young projects like

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,680
hyperledger cactus which is really

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,600
focused on

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
interoperability and integration between

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,720
different ledger systems

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,560
so we thought that would help pull these

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320
projects together we also started

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,040
funding mentorship projects specifically

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,839
focused on

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,639
cross-project linkages so that one uh

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,560
hyper

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,199
hyperledger explorer which is kind of a

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,199
ui to browsing your ledger layer

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,160
which was designed for fabric now can

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,079
run on aroha and a couple others

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,000
we also thought about doubling down more

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,360
on the working groups and sigs making

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,160
them more active maybe even more

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,919
technical

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,679
and driving more people to them and then

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,520
have that be a way to say well

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,760
fabric does this sawtooth says this can

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,559
we try to make things simpler and and

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,640
align

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,480
um and then finally you know we tried

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,079
saying well we have all these informal

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,520
kind of processes lots of open source

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,200
communities have these let's document

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,799
them let's standardize them

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,240
in the interest of fairness so that

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,919
everyone knows the process and we

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,200
absolutely can be treating everyone

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,840
uh fairly uh some of those uh approaches

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,720
worked

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,160
um and some of them tended to not have

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,559
much of a measurable

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,280
outcome i highlighted the ones in yellow

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,280
that had the

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,520
that seemed to have positive outcomes it

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,440
was a little disappointing to me that we

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,280
still struggle i think to get

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
once you have these teams kind of so

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
separated out to drive that sense of

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,200
collective stakeholdership

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,080
uh as a as a as a responsibility of

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,080
being a maintainer

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,919
on a hyperledger project i i there's

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,320
still some ideas to make that work

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,240
um when we can meet face to face again i

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
hope that will be a real driver for

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,520
for a lot of this um uh but uh but we

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,600
still have some teams that are very

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,360
siloed off from other teams and almost

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,200
have that as a point of pride um

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,799
which which i really struggle personally

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,960
with understanding um

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,720
and we also found that standardizing and

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
trying to document all your processes as

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,679
well as

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,280
tensioned as that is can come across as

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,440
bureaucracy can come across

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
as you know just lots of new sets of

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
rules to be to

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,840
have to follow to make any progress on

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,840
things and so figuring out how to

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,960
balance that with agility informality

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,520
and keeping things fun

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,720
is is something we struggle with um and

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,559
that's really it i want to

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,080
pause there and i always feel awkward

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,120
just like staring into a camera and

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,880
talking although i know people in your

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,840
industry do that all day long

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
um but i'm seeing uh some faces now and

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,640
uh

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,760
i don't see any questions yet uh so i'll

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
take my cue from john

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
john how should we open some q a yeah if

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,280
anybody has any questions

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,200
we got probably a minute or two here so

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,000
we can transition over to jim

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,360
um but uh any questions from the group

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,840
of brian just feel free to take yourself

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
off mute

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
i do have a question about the size of

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,240
hyper ledger

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,559
and you have lots of projects and lots

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,640
of sigs and lots of things so how many

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,840
engineers are working within the

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,960
hyper-measure

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,039
ecosystem currently

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,400
hard to characterize that uh okay so

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360
officially in terms of numbers of

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,799
maintainers

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,679
across those 16 projects we have uh

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,240
well we had 600 people vote uh in the

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,000
last

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,600
uh um technical steering committee

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,360
election which is all people who've

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,720
contributed in the last year

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,640
we have about 150 people who i think are

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,640
properly maintainers on those different

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,080
projects um so some of the projects only

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,440
have a few some have more like 20 um

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,080
and those maintainers not all of them

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,320
are full-time some of them will be

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,799
but uh very few projects have i'd say

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,840
dedicated full-time engineers maybe

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,559
maybe four of those of those 16

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,919
so it's there is a risk that you provide

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,280
all this infrastructure and all this

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,520
nice way to slice and dice

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,320
and your individual efforts fail to get

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,159
critical mass

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,240
um and it sometimes is discouraging when

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,200
you have you know a great a great call

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,880
lined up and you're

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
positioned right like we have a devrel

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,919
call between our marketing committee and

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,280
the developers and then three developers

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,360
show up you feel like

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,640
you know it's like hosting a party and

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,559
you got a great dj

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,720
you know you hired diplo or whatever and

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,400
it's like your three best friends show

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,000
up and you have a party um but you

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,919
really were hoping for a couple hundred

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,159
you know there's a risk of that and that

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,559
happens sometimes

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,840
awesome great question david um any

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,760
others here and i know we're admitted

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
over i'm sure jim won't mind if

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,000
we take a couple more questions with

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
brian if somebody has one

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,320
i have a question for you brian hi this

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,480
is nigel um

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,760
flying your own airplane right i

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
thinking as a

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,720
builder of open source projects in the

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,200
past you know one of the things that was

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,880
most

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,360
educational for us is to actually take

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,039
on the role of consumer of our own dog

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
food right and actually go use it and

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,360
then find out where all the rough edges

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,440
were and

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,880
the barriers to entry do you do any of

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,120
that in hyperledger are you going to

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,200
formalize that process anyway

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,200
we've thought about how to dog food or

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,360
what it would make sense to dog food

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,120
in the blockchain space a lot of the

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,520
projects run a mainnet

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,440
uh you know which they then that gets

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,120
into all sort of token economics and

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,120
and running an ico and that sort of

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,320
thing and um we were actually pretty

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,000
explicit at the beginning we would not

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,880
be running a mainnet this is software

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,640
for you to run your own networks um but

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,960
but having test nets and that sort of

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,559
thing

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,159
it's just something we didn't get around

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,480
to um in a mix of

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,159
you know you know making a financial

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,320
commitment on our side to

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,159
the servers and and really the personnel

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,960
required to to make sure that could run

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,440
well

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,720
uh as well as you know the volunteer

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
efforts people say oh that's a good idea

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
but no one really stood up to say i will

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,600
help manifest

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,600
building test nets and managing a rack

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,120
of gear and that sort of thing so

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,919
um aside from ci cd processes that we

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,400
have in place just

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,520
using really github actions um um not

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
really doing any uh

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,120
any any any running any services to use

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,320
to really illustrate how well the

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,200
software works

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,760
um and uh uh one thing i'd like to do

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,159
but again

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,320
finding partners to to do this has been

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,320
struggling is like public demonstrations

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,360
of how how the code works in public

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,039
networks but

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,640
um a lot of this code has been designed

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,480
to run privately so so we

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,520
really just view the more that we can go

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,720
there and talk about where people are

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,799
using this in production

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,400
uh in some cases public facing like the

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,000
sovereign network that's focused on

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,679
digital identity

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
is is what we try to do but in so many

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,799
cases these are permission blockchain

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,080
networks that are for private use cases

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,440
that are really hard to

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,880
demonstrate to the public how well it

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,159
works except through case studies and

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,919
those sorts of things which we

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,840
i didn't talk about it here but we

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,919
invest a lot of time and effort in

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,280
in marketing and helping the companies

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,559
that are using this get their word out

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,600
about how they're using it

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,120
um but uh but not enough on dog fooding

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
i'd say dog food has been hard for us to

00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,840
vision how we

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,360
how we would do that okay thanks brian

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,559
awesome great questions and brian if you

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,840
mind putting some of your contact

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,320
information in the chat for others in

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,440
case more people have questions

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,159
thank you so much for your time your

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,159
