with that on a translation over to jim

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
zemlin so

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,799
as you know jim zemlin is the executive

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,839
director of the linux foundation and one

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,719
of the fortunate

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,599
viewpoints he's had in his tenure here

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,440
is to see

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,200
not only linux foundation start from

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,640
zero to where it is now

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,880
but also the 350 plus projects in here

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
start from zero to where they are now um

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
and he's here to share some

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,599
insight and strategies for success so

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
jim take it away

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,840
oh jim you're on mute

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,800
voila now you're making me now yes

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
welcome jim

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,160
thank you hello everybody just i want to

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,960
start right off yes i have coveted hair

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,360
it's been a while since i've seen all of

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
you

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,039
or really anyone but i look forward to

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,239
someday

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,000
seeing you again in person soon

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,359
you know i thought i would just walk

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,559
through and

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,400
do a little retrospective um

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
you know it wasn't too long ago where we

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,600
were all sitting at the in the academy

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
board room and

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,080
uh it was at very early stages you know

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,240
all of you were um

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,840
excited about the prospect of creating

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
an open source community in your

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
industry and

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
uh i think it's been pretty impressive

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,200
to see uh

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,680
how many gains that you've made in a

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
relatively short period of time and i'm

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
i'm not talking in hyper ledger years

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
i'm talking in linux foundation years

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,040
which are just much longer

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,040
although brian goes back all the way to

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
the apache software foundation so he can

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,759
relate as well

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,600
you know you've created uh and are home

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,479
to some really good projects

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,680
i think that your leadership on being an

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,040
inclusive

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,479
uh in a or an organization and community

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,720
that promotes diversity

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,479
is uh important um and uh certainly the

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,759
last year has tested all of us

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,680
in terms of the amount of hardship uh in

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,680
in so many industries and and i think

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,600
yours was

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,159
disproportionately uh impacted so it's

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,200
been

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:13,120
uh impressive to see the progress even

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,160
in the face of that hardship to compare

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,360
to the linux foundation's first uh

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,080
few years uh you're killing it

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,560
uh i was still trying to convince my now

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,959
wife

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,599
that i had an actual real job in the

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,200
first

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,800
few years of the linux foundation

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,959
we had a data center where we were

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,000
providing actually access to

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,080
big two-way machines so that linux

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,400
developers could harden the platform

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
which we ended up pretty much selling on

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,000
ebay a few years later as

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,640
all of that technology became accessible

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,319
on people's laptops and then obviously

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,239
we ended up moving to cloud computing

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
where you have sort of infinite network

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,720
storage

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,959
compute available theoretically

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,840
we were fighting some tough battles

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
around

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,040
legal provenance as it comes to open

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
source

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,319
back then there were copyright claims on

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
the kernel

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,000
we learned a lot from that and have

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,640
built a whole

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,440
structure around reducing intellectual

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,080
property risk within our communities

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,280
and all of the resources around that

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,799
whether it's

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,640
um you know guidance on how to um

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,560
you know manage licenses within an open

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
source community contribution agreement

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
infrastructure

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,319
uh to more advanced things around uh

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,920
patent no-fly zones uh and so forth uh

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,519
we've done a lot of work and all that's

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,280
available to all of you

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
i remember telling a ton of microsoft

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,159
jokes we don't tell those jokes anymore

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,319
they're a

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
important part of our community but i

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,879
think the most important thing and this

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,720
is something that

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,760
uh all of you could um

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,159
mimic is you know the biggest thing i

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,200
was

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,720
tasked to do was to create

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,159
momentum around open source

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,599
and linux as the future of

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,400
uh technical uh outcomes in in

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,599
pretty much the entire technology sector

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,239
you know back then

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,400
unix and windows were really the

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,479
dominant platforms in computing

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,639
and our idea was to create a sense of

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,040
inevitability

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,680
around the technology of linux and open

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,000
source

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,400
you know an implicit futures contract

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
you know if if you choose the wrong

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
platform

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,520
you choose the wrong programming

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,560
language you end up

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,720
with very few opportunities and

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,639
very little support in the long run in

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
some cases you know sort of having to go

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,320
on your own i think all of you have been

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,560
faced with making tough

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,520
technology decisions and maybe a few

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
years later saying

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,080
ah i really wish i hadn't chose that and

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,919
so what we wanted to do was create that

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,400
inevitability which created a big

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,039
flywheel around our project

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
in terms in this case linux in terms of

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,160
participation

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,440
in terms of an ecosystem of commercial

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
providers

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,000
and then commercial reinvestment back

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,280
into the open source project

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,479
um you know fast forward to many many

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,520
many years later

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,639
and this year we're having a tremendous

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,039
uh really our best year ever in terms of

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,120
the first couple months of 2021.

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,400
uh we just cracked 2 million trainings

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,759
i'm going to talk about how you can all

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,039
take advantage of our training

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,160
infrastructure

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,280
um we're adding a new member a week i'm

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
sorry a day

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,280
at the linux foundation in fact we're

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,600
adding 1.8 members a day so almost two

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,639
new members a day across our projects

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,919
two to three new projects a week in a

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,039
wide range of

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,160
industry sectors just this week we

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,319
launched initiatives in cyber security

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
initiatives around open source projects

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,360
around racial justice

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,560
and much more we have a bunch of

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
projects

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,880
on tap to announce in the next few

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,360
months in fact one of those projects is

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,960
in an adjacent industry to yours

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,919
we're working on a 3d engine

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,800
open source project and if any of you

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
are interested

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
in that particular initiative feel free

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,479
to reach

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,720
out to me that's a more gaming

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,080
sector-specific

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,840
project we

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,840
have done new self-serving identity

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,960
efforts we're working on

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
5g networking technology uh you know

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,039
from the

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,479
very low level radio all the way

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,600
on up and so on and so forth so just an

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,240
amazing start

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,639
it bodes well i think for all of us and

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,639
for

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,479
the academy software foundation being a

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,520
part of the linux foundation to take

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,639
advantage

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,120
of what we're doing here the

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919
the thing that i probably presented to

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,520
all of you

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,280
three years ago holds the same today

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,960
in that one of the things that we want

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,440
to make sure is that

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,440
these projects get used to create real

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,360
products and services you know i like

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,280
i choose projects products and profit

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,319
just because i like the 3p

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,280
ring to it but you know your projects

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,240
are used to make

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,759
your products which are great films uh

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,120
incredible effects

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,840
uh and then you're able to reinvest uh

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,680
some of the resources uh from you know

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,680
succeeding in your industry

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,160
back into these open source projects and

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,759
you know the critical part of this cycle

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,319
is it not only creates

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
economic sustainability but more

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,240
importantly

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
it creates an innovation feedback loop

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
you know

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,879
you really are the innovators when

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,520
you're

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:56,319
working on some new interesting way

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,680
to create visual effects and if the more

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
you feed those back

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,840
upstream the more you will be forced to

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,720
innovate on the next project and the

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,639
next project

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
and the next project and those who are

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,000
unafraid

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
of sharing and always raising their

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,080
innovation bar

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,440
and really creating this flywheel are

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,440
the organizations

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,720
that succeed one of the things that

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,720
we've been working on lately

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
is when we look across all of our

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
innovation communities the scale is

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,400
tremendous

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,759
you know we host 27 000 meetings a year

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,240
at the linux foundation

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
our chat groups are sending millions of

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,919
messages

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,399
we're exchanging millions of emails

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,519
across

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,440
all of these projects just in a given

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,959
year we have at least 200

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,000
000 developers from 12 000 companies

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,000
contributing to the collective set of

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
linux foundation projects

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
you know remember our projects although

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,360
limited in

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,160
number and we have about 16 000

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,040
repositories compared to that 25 million

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,240
let's say

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,880
on github these are the projects that

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,560
are

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,959
of most import to industry and society

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,480
they're projects that are impacting the

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,040
energy sector

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,040
your industry in cloud computing

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,519
projects like kubernetes have become the

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,200
de facto computing platform

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,760
for that industry uh in the automotive

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
sector

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,000
our automotive grade linux initiative is

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
in millions of production

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519
automobiles you know we recently did

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,160
some work with

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,120
uh harvard to try and answer the

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,959
question

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,320
what are the most important shared

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,040
software initiatives

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
in the world uh and when you really

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,640
measure it

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,320
it gets down to you know not millions of

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,480
open source projects but

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
to really thousands and these are the

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
thousands of projects that we all depend

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
on

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,880
in in your industry there's a unique set

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,959
on top of just

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,800
sort of core operating system technology

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,880
we all need that that's open source

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,320
but a unique set that are applied in the

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
visual effects industry

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,560
to all of you one of the things

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
and i'm going to try and show you a

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,240
video here

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,760
one of the things that we're doing is

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
creating tools to help

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,519
uh enable collaboration

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,519
with minimum overhead and i want to show

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
you some of those tools and i want to

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,800
encourage

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
all of you to take advantage of them one

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,360
of the things i heard

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,160
earlier in the discussion was the idea

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,959
of okay how many projects can we bring

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,720
in to the organization and plausibly

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,600
support those

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,560
my mission is to make it as easy as

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,959
possible as

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,839
seamless as possible as automated as

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
possible to do

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,600
all the things you need to do to get a

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,920
project up and running

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
so that you can really focus as many of

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,000
your resources as possible

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,680
on that innovation component of the

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
effort so i want to show you this

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,800
open source right now see if you can

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
hear it whether it's

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
powering the public cloud or enabling

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,800
autonomous cars

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,440
open source is fully entrenched within

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,200
the global software supply chain

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,040
but let's face it building and

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,079
maintaining an open source project

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,320
at global scale is a lot of work in

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,440
order to successfully scale a project

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,279
you need both great code and tools to

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,360
help you drive the increasing demands of

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,279
daily operations

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,959
insights into who's contributing and

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,000
what it takes to supercharge your

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,160
project

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,680
and the resources and expertise to

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,320
engage your community

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,720
and drive adoption wouldn't you rather

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,440
spend less time on things like debugging

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,839
marketing and admin work and more time

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,839
building amazing tech

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,360
as the trusted home for developers to

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,920
collaborate on and scale

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,560
open source projects we at the linux

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,440
foundation

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,240
are here to help we've taken decades of

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
experience

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
working with some of the greatest

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
developers in the world to build a

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,639
proven methodology

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
that helps projects scale from open

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,880
source repositories

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,480
to game-changing technologies and rolled

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,399
this into a holistic

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,079
self-service toolkit called lfx

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,240
from monitoring project health and

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,560
community engagement to facilitating

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,800
project funding from around the world

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,480
lfx is here to help you focus on what

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,680
you do best

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,600
innovate lfx arms you with complete

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,079
visibility into your project

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,399
and insights to influence growth the

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,959
means to establish a security posture

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
that builds trust with your community

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,880
and the tools and framework

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,760
to foster community through mentorship

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,839
programs

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,399
events and training not to mention

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,880
empowering you with a range of other

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,880
tools for managing code contributions

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,040
community participation license

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,120
agreements and more

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,720
put your open source project on the fast

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,560
track to long-term growth and

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,920
sustainability

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,920
get started with lfx today at lfx.dev

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,480
all right so go check out

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,639
lfx um i don't want to get too far ahead

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,680
of myself here on the

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,839
strategy suggestions but

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,079
we're rolling this out right now all of

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,440
these tools are available to all of your

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,440
projects

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,040
i think that your organization has

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,480
already started using

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,880
are easy cla tools

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,040
i believe that the insights platform is

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,720
being rolled out

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,720
but i want to just sort of walk you

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,399
through some of the really interesting

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,200
technology that you're going to see

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,880
later on this year and i'll caveat all

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,519
of this by saying you know be patient

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
with us

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,959
uh as we roll these tools out we want

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
your feedback

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,560
not everything's gonna work perfectly

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,320
the first time but um you know we have a

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
whole team dedicated to making these

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,240
work for your community

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,519
on insights what you're going to see in

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,639
our next version

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,120
is a much more devops focused

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,000
view into your community that'll give

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,839
you a sense

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,079
of how you're performing as a

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,279
development uh

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,600
collective versus what an average or

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
what a well-functioning open source

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,040
project

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,880
should look like in terms of mean time

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,680
to pull request resolution

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,320
in terms of security scanning around

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,000
vulnerabilities within those projects

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
uh in terms of the diversity of

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,959
committers within those

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
projects in terms of your entire cicd

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,000
pipeline

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,399
where you may have bottlenecks in that

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,760
process you'll be able to gain access

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,839
into visibility on

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,839
whether or not an individual maintainer

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,440
might be a bottleneck and

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,000
think about whether or not you might

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,560
want to reorganize the structure of that

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,320
project

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,480
in order to create better development

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,800
velocity and more

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,120
and that's just one module in the

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,320
security module what we're asking all of

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,120
our projects to do

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,959
is to have a better security stance by

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,519
enabling them with a few

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,240
new tools dynamic and static code

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,160
analysis

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,199
tools uh we provide a aggregated version

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,519
of sneak

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,880
which just this morning raised 300

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,120
million dollars

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,199
for their security tooling which was

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,079
offered free to your organization

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,440
these projects and will only get better

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,320
we're also integrating

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,760
new technologies around code secrets so

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
that we can make sure that we

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,000
proactively

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,920
if one of your developers you know puts

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,240
some aws credentials

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,040
in in a repo and it leaks out we're

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
going to catch that

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,880
in later on this year we're going to

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,759
have a version 2 of our mentoring

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,480
platform

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,800
that will enable you a very seamless way

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,880
to

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,920
pair mentors and mentees in your

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
community

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,120
bring people from diverse backgrounds

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,480
we'll pay

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,079
for uh mentor mentees

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,000
in those programs from diverse

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,040
backgrounds we'll have

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,639
task tracking match making

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,560
and a whole bunch of functionality

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,480
that'll make that easier

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,880
finally we're going to have a few things

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,360
in our project control center that will

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,240
also be rolling out later this year

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,680
think of this as a way to provision for

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,680
every project

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,560
your chat channels set up a website

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,560
set up an entire ci cd system whether

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,680
you know it's jenkins or get lab or

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,320
github

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,480
uh it'll allow you to set up mailing

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,880
lists it'll allow you to set up social

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,639
media channels to provision

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,199
all of the things in hours that usually

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,399
take

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,360
weeks sometimes months

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,199
for your projects to grow uh all of

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,040
that's coming i encourage all of you to

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,279
take advantage of it

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,600
if you want to learn more about uh lfx

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,839
just hop onto lfx.dev

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,199
or just reach out to me or any of my

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,040
team and we can get you in touch with

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,160
the engineers who are working on all of

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,440
this

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,320
so i want to finish here by just giving

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,120
some thoughts

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,519
over um you know what you can think

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
about

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,079
in the next three years um you know i

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,240
think one of the things

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,079
that is important to remind folks and i

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,799
think rob said it earlier is

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,199
you know hey should we think about x or

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,640
y

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,400
you know we've got all the right people

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,880
here in the room uh

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,679
ultimately that's an incredible strength

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,400
of

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,400
this group is you really do have the

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,679
right people here in the room

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,000
and so i would be bold in your thinking

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,799
because it is actually very very

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,160
difficult

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,280
to get the right people all in the same

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,919
room i assure you we've

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,480
worked very hard in various different

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,640
industry sectors whether it's you know

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,320
you know energy providers or financial

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,480
services sector

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,559
but once you get everybody in the room

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,200
great things can happen

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,160
i would continue to try and bring new

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,240
projects

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,720
uh into your uh portfolio i i think that

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,360
uh brian mentioned earlier there's some

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,520
pitfalls with maybe

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,760
pseudo-competitive projects coming in or

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,360
maybe you're concerned you know you're

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
taking on too much

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,960
uh but you know just in my experience

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,280
now where we have

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
over 680 projects at the linux

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,559
foundation

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,200
uh you know not only is it important to

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,000
sort of let organic innovation happen

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,039
even if that includes some failure

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,520
but we've got your back in providing you

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,039
the tools and know-how to to be able to

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,600
let those thousand flowers

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,600
grow without overwhelming you in terms

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,799
of logistics

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,360
i would look at expanding into standards

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,640
i think that there are lots of

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,360
requirements for

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,559
uh industry specifications uh the

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,559
academy has done

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,559
already great work in this area around

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,039
uh you know standards and

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,919
uh we now are poised to help you even

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,559
more

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,000
the linux foundation three years later

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,919
is one of the largest standards

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,720
development organizations in the world

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,840
through our joint

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,600
development foundation we host efforts

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,400
like the alliance road media that's

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,600
adjacent to

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,440
your industry but we also host

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,440
many many more we have status to create

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,280
international standards through our iso

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,280
pass submitter status

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,720
we have two internationally recognized

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,880
standards around software bill of

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
materials and license compliance

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
so this is something that your

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,799
organization can take a

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,320
advantage of and i would uh consider you

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,120
to be ambitious in

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,600
how you could leverage that i think you

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,640
uh

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
can do great work in building a pipeline

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,160
of new talent

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,760
into your industry by uh taking

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,080
advantage of our training

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,840
uh infrastructure we have an

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,880
infrastructure that can help you make

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,440
massive open online courses on edx

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,080
skills based certifications where a

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,080
proctor

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,160
can test somebody through a webcam and

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,000
you watch them actually do technical

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,919
work to make sure they know how to do it

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,559
we can build self-paced e-learning

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,960
programs for you and much much more

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,679
somebody mentioned uh earlier you know

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,760
creating

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,120
uh somehow to some some way to share

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,080
information on how to

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,919
share ip in the in your industry i i

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,640
think you can build custom courses

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,360
uh based on the already existing open

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,000
source

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,919
program office classes that we have but

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,039
i would be ambitious here as well don't

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,320
even you know

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,240
i don't know that you even have to limit

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,880
yourself just to open source i mean if

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
there's just an

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,760
area where you need talent and skills

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,320
development

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,760
you know and it aligns with what we're

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,840
doing at the lf

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,200
we'd be willing to create those courses

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,520
with you and we can do it

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,760
very fast and in a very cost effective

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,280
way

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,520
i think continuing to promote

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,880
uh diversity within your industry is

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,080
critically important

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,520
uh just this week we launched seven new

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,360
open source projects

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,840
around uh equity in racial justice

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,720
things like our open sentencing program

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,000
uh some

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,039
things like our racial language removal

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,600
uh program uh and much more

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,240
we we will support you uh in those

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,679
efforts

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,320
uh i'm willing to underwrite uh

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,480
in particular mentees if you want to set

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,480
up a mentoring program to bring diverse

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,600
candidates and teach them how to

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,960
work in your world we really believe in

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,400
that at the lf

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,919
our our own employees mirror that uh and

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
please don't be afraid to ask for our

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,799
help i i put this last

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,080
a couple things in here to say you know

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,280
somebody was asking you know should we

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,480
hire people to do

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,559
unique work um you know if there's some

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,120
kind of bottleneck or there's some

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
unique

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,320
talent you know you if there's elena's

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,919
torvalds in your world i mean he

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,080
obviously works for the linux foundation

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,679
greg carl hartmann does we employ

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,280
test engineers and much much more um

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,039
you know that's something that i

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,840
wouldn't be afraid to do i think the

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,720
main thing you

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,120
don't want to do is you know be on the

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,960
hook

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,799
for what a software company might

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,080
provide in terms of you know

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,840
24 7 support or some kind of sla i don't

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,360
think that works quite well in an open

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,640
source organization

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,360
uh but but you know it it's not mutually

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,039
exclusive

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,039
you can hire people to do interesting

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,559
development work uh as long as you're

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,520
not just essentially becoming a software

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,400
company

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,840
um and then lastly and i said this

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,600
before

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,919
don't you know get the mentality

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,919
of being unafraid to contribute

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,120
innovation to the comments

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,760
because the most innovative developers

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,960
and people

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,000
a love it we did a survey with harvard

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,480
uh earlier

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,280
late last year and asked them why they

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
participate

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,080
in open source and i assure you money

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,679
and career was at the bottom of the list

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,799
and that the top was

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,919
you know uh mastering one's craft

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,640
you know recognition amongst peers the

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,120
act of creativity i think all of you can

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,000
relate to that perhaps more than others

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,720
and so be unafraid to push the

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,080
boundaries

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,679
to contribute code that you know

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,440
in many ways people all think their

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,840
stuff is super special

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
it's really the most special uh

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,200
innovators that are willing to

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,440
continually contribute to a commons

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,640
and then innovate even further on top of

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,120
that so i i

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,919
encourage you to do that so with that i

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,360
can

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,480
stop uh here and answer any questions

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,240
hopefully i didn't go too

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,159
over time here this is really insightful

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,520
jim this has been great anybody um if

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,240
you have questions we definitely do have

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,039
a few minutes

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,039
um for anything

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,840
just uh take yourself off mute

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,799
well i i want to say thank you jim for

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,360
being here and

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,000
presenting with us and i won't prevent

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,200
other people

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,159
with questions but it's not necessarily

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
known to everyone

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,679
how much you have helped us in setting

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,960
up the foundation at the beginning when

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,919
we were looking at

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,159
what to do with the set of problems that

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,720
we had and we had a very narrow focus on

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,320
the

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:22,159
on on a few things and you came in

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,240
and and open open the

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,400
world of possibilities to us and your

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,480
support throughout

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
setting up the foundation and all this

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,960
experience that you've gathered over the

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
years

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,120
is a big reason why we're here today

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,159
and what you bring to us

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,200
in a moment like this a glimpse of all

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,480
that you're doing at the

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,679
linux foundation it shows us

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,480
many new paths that we can take in our

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,520
in our own industry so certainly i want

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,080
to say

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,640
thank you for for being there since the

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,360
beginning

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
and for being there with us today it's

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,080
really good

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,840
thank you yeah i i i please encourage

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,679
all of you to take advantage of the

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,760
infrastructure uh

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,720
we're laying down for all of you i'm

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,679
just a

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
huge believer in you know organic

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,799
innovation

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,679
and uh i think the more that you can

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,520
enable seamless integration through a

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,559
lot of this automation technology that

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,559
we're building

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,840
the better innovation outcomes you're

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,320
gonna have

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,559
uh and i'm just you know it's it's

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,360
incredibly satisfying to to be able to

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,799
work with

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,760
an industry like yours uh to to try

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,320
these tools out

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,240
and you know rob on on insights you know

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
we want to move it from who's working on

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,320
what to

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,039
you know uh how good

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,559
are you at modern development practices

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,720
how can you benchmark uh

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,000
efficiency you know how can we take all

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,520
of our communities

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,640
and move them into that uh devops world

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,120
uh and provide as seamless an experience

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,640
as possible to do that

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,840
absolutely some of the earlier sites i

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,600
think kimball was sharing was pulled

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,480
right out of lfx insight so you're

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,120
already seeing

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,520
the work right in there and i know rob

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,880
you've

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,880
commented on those before as well

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,440
yeah we we you know i i'm probably

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,559
harder than anyone

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,559
on the on the insights team on like hey

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:27,120
let's let's define what metrics are core

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,919
let's get great visualizations on how to

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,120
do that

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,600
uh and so i'm i'm very excited uh

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,880
and and chomping at the bit to roll out

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,240
our second

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,200
uh version of it that will will be

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,679
you know much more i think actionable in

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,679
terms

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,400
of what you can get out of those

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,400
analytics

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,600
awesome any other questions from the

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,799
group here

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,640
um and i think there's a couple that

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,559
have came through um just in the chat

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
out of the questions just andrew pierce

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,720
just saying how helpful informative this

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,640
was

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,159
um and then larry i think last year

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,919
somebody said something effective this

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,559
organization has only existed for two

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,400
years

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,279
and we can't imagine how we ever got

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,279
along without it

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,840
and we are we're true right now um so

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,360
that's really thanks to the hard work of

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,720
all of you in the developer communities

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,640
you you're the one who makes all this

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,240
happen so

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,840
