	00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
we can move into

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,719
the q a an open discussion so we

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,719
want this to be um to be interactive so

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,320
the questions that are lined up here um

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,400
are there to be answered and we'll

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
capture your feedback but it's also

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
uh seed for discussion and we have a

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
little bit more than a half hour

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
we have something like 40 minutes to to

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,760
have the discussions

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,559
so it's really the core of this forum

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,680
where we want to to get your opinion

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,120
about things

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,000
so we'll start with this poll here and

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,079
some of you

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
uh most of you i think are used the

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,200
process by now

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,360
in order to respond to the poll please

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,320
go to the link that is listed

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,719
up there pauliev.com aswf

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,920
on any device a phone tablet your

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,199
computer

00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,000
and you will be able to access

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,280
the you will see a version of these

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
questions

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
um in previous year we knew the oscar

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,200
nomination by the time of our forum we

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,960
don't know them this year

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,880
so we i looked at the predictive

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,600
list of some of the outfits out there

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,280
and there we go somebody voted for mink

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,759
so the list is uh not accurate but

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,840
it's a sampling and

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,960
we are we're about 50 people on the

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
on the forum at the moment so if you can

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,799
all give it a

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,000
give it a shot and once we have

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,280
30 of you who figured it out

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,799
we'll move on to the next question

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,399
this is not binding we will not check

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
if our academy software foundation

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,840
predictions

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
were accurate

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,159
you said prediction but then you said

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
who should win those are two totally

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,479
different things david you're right

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,439
it's i did that on purpose to confuse

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,520
everyone

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,440
on this first question to get our

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,640
creative juice flowing

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,640
yeah nobody like mink

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,879
that's interesting all right we need

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,120
five more people

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,120
to come in contribute

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,959
contribute and answer

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
this is the part where you need to to

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,680
stop multitasking and

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,760
start focusing on

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,280
on the forum if you don't we'll be stuck

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,959
on this slide for like

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,840
many minutes three more people

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,840
come on come on

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,239
do i have to go and put an answer myself

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,440
i'm going to make an incognito browser

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,440
pretty soon right

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,760
okay i'll call it good enough

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
okay

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,000
it looks like i may not have the

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,280
control

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,799
ah there we go here's our first question

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,360
we ask that question every time so we

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,959
want to pull

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,599
your opinion how did the foundation

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,920
perform in the last year

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,920
according to your expectation totally

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,959
intuitive question

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:07,599
the last year was very

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,519
disrupted obviously and

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,640
it's fair to say that we all had our

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,920
mind

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,640
on our own business in a more intense

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,640
way than usual

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
all right

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,639
that is good and from memory we went

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,840
down a little bit from last year

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,440
which we can attribute to many

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,560
in terms of the performing

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,280
beyond expectation or as expected or

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,320
higher expectations david

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,120
possibly yeah that's true we will be

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,479
analyzing this result endlessly

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
comparing it to previous year

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,360
and going into more specifics now

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,080
okay

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,080
a few issues hold on a second give you

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:25,840
more second we have 33 answers on this

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:25,840
so that's good

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,919
all right so here's our classic question

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
that we also asked every year

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,440
as for where we are now please list

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
the open source project that would be

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,600
good candidates for the foundation

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,800
so we've asked the question

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,479
we're asking it again to see how your

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,840
thinking is evolving

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,639
if there has been new projects that have

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
come in

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,360
that you've seen

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,400
coming up

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,840
give you the time to

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,960
so we have our classic answer to our

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,680
classic question

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,440
usd coming up on top material x

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,600
i would love to learn i know a lot of

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,560
these um i would love to learn a little

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,319
bit more about

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,000
zoe or zoe from whomever

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,360
i was just googling it oh it's already a

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,599
linux foundation project

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,360
even better somebody want to

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,319
indicate why they are campaigning that

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,199
it would be good to fold them

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,759
you don't have to if you're not

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,759
comfortable but

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,800
it looks like it's actually part of the

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,520
open main theme project in the linux

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
foundation

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,639
which so in theory we would

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,240
be only half a step away from being able

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,440
to strategize with them if there were

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
some relevant connections for our

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,199
industry so feel free to

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
email us offline or email kimbel if

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,840
you'd like if you're

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,840
if you'd rather not speak up here

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,360
all right

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
it's great to see material exxon here

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,919
certainly an

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,039
open source library that could easily be

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
targeted for this

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,680
um does anybody want to speak up as to a

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,680
why there

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,440
other than it would just be a nice home

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,960
for it since maybe you're starting to

00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:01,919
think about leveraging it

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,919
i mean one thing rob from from the

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,039
studio technology perspective that's a

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,039
little different is just

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,960
we work with so many different vendors

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,599
across the industry that

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,400
having it be open source would help with

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
different

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,639
collaborations with software vendors or

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,000
a variety of different visual effects or

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,360
post vendors so from

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,360
that that's from my perspective

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,039
and just to be clear it is already open

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,440
sourced but it is not

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,560
part of it's not re it's not hosted by

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,800
the foundation yet

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,039
yeah but that is not out of the question

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,039
at all

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,640
all right does anyone want to volunteer

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,560
to be the one to build the linux distro

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,720
to get that one started that's a that's

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,720
a sizable chunk of work but i like it

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,440
and no but i i'll confess to put that on

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
there because that would be something

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
for discussion

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,680
later i don't necessarily think that's

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,760
that's that's a reasonable project

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,120
for the chemistry foundation to do but i

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,959
think there's work to be done

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
in that space it's certainly the kind of

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,600
project that would benefit from a

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,279
shared ecosystem of people doing it

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,360
because it's a bigger job than any

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
one of us would probably take on on our

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
own but it

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,040
might be might not be an unreasonable

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,399
job to do as a community if it was

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
if we felt that the other distros

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,320
weren't a good enough match or maybe a

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,800
variation on an existing distro was the

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
right match

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
just just out of curiosity would that be

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,640
sort of um i think centos was

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,320
fairly heavily used in this industry is

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,920
that sort of a follow

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,760
a follow-on because of the shift that

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,640
that community did

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,519
it that that shift certainly has

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,600
inspired

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
more discussion and and it's it's

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
causing studios to re-evaluate which

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,920
linux intro they're using

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,080
um and i think you know a lot of linux

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,600
distros are really not optimizing for

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,959
high-end desktop work anymore it's

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
either for servers or general office

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,080
productivity

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
and while it's not an issue maybe for us

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,959
right now i can see five to ten years

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
down the line like there's a

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,839
sustainability issue there and is this

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,720
an opportunity for us to kind of get

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,040
ahead of that

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,160
and start working together more as an

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,000
industry so

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,680
it's with my vfx reference platform hat

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,240
on that's something that we're planning

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,279
to uh

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,399
you know in the vs tech community you

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,920
can talk about this something we're

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
planning to write a sort of paper on

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
over the next kind of

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,640
a couple of months i hope um just to

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,000
kind of spur some discussion over the

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,360
kind of conferences you know as we get

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,680
into the conference season

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,200
um because i think that there is an

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,959
opportunity there for

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
uh for i think the industry and the

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,480
community to work pull together in the

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,959
same direction and help steer

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
uh you know steer steers towards a more

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,480
sustainable

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,079
uh you know workstation uh you know

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360
linux workstation distro

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,800
and maybe the academy software

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,560
foundation particularly with the

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,160
relation with linux foundation

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,120
may have a role to play in that yeah

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,399
and i don't i don't know uh if larry if

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,279
you want to speak up but the

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,320
um the with the presentation that that

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,120
sony did of

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,560
things like spfs and spk that they did

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
at the ci working group

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,040
with projects like that um that where

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,320
you're starting to blur the line between

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,440
os and not it may make a lot of sense to

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
really talk about that so

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,839
i'm not quite sure what you want me to

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
say about it

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,920
and there's something to be said also

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,800
about linux having been

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,959
obviously a big role to play in the back

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,000
end and cloud streaming part of

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,440
industries and some vendors have efforts

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
on that side

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,000
so linux is is always and that's been

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,079
growing as a night as a

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
platform to support but when it comes to

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,120
the workstation aspect

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,800
there seems to be always some drivers

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,920
and some

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,680
particular hardware that that is not

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,760
readily available as from other

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,079
platforms so having a

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,800
more unified voice for a film industry

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,720
around linux could be valuable it's a

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,160
good one

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,160
it's a new one on our list good day

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,880
any other comments about i'm uh the

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
we've talked about res a number of times

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,720
i'm curious

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,639
i since i only know a little bit about

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,079
it has anyone already reached out to

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,480
them are they

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,279
are they in us are the maintainers in a

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,560
situation where

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,040
they feel like we could bring them

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,480
useful value or um

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,720
are we have we even investigated that

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,920
yet because it always comes up around

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,800
here in our list of of

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,000
priorities to think about yeah and and

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,000
one thing to

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,120
to note while we are we do make these

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,760
lists as

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,440
often as we can it's up to the projects

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,560
to to decide when they're

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,279
they're ready to yeah to or

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,920
or that they feel like they could

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
benefit

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,959
um and so um we're not a group that does

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,639
hostile takeovers of open source

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,040
projects or branches them

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,560
uh were just in the mode of supporting

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,120
them to your point kimball

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,680
yeah yeah i was i was wondering rather

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,920
or kim

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,920
if we could just talk about that process

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,639
for people that maybe have projects and

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,399
how to

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,160
go about approaching it i thought that

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,920
might be a good subject in terms of

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,360
hey i have something i'm thinking about

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,480
it how do i how do i

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,240
go about doing this yeah

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,240
there's actually a form online that you

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
can fill out

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,160
and the we try to make the intake

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
process as straightforward as possible

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,920
it's not particularly complicated

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,760
but you do want to have a sense of what

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,600
is involved and

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
if you need someone to or want someone

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,199
to kind of walk you through the

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,959
processes you could talk to any of the

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,720
people who are maintaining current

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,000
projects because all of the maintainers

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,839
of the current projects have walked

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,519
through that process going from

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,360
a project that they already had open

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,320
source and and migrating it into the

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,920
academy

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,360
things like the cia badge and those

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,639
other things have been questions that

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
people have like what does it mean for

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,440
my project

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
to have these new requirements on it and

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,800
we can walk you through how

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
the requirements are implemented how you

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,680
can get extra resources to help solve

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
some of these things so you don't have

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,320
to just take it all on

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,680
on your current maintainers and i'd say

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,199
either work with an existing project

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
maintainer or reach out to kimball and

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
attack

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,920
because they can walk you through what

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,959
that process is provide advice and input

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
and then once you submit it's not like

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,880
there's a two-way evaluation right you

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,320
have to decide as the submitter

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,000
that you think probably would be a good

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,079
fit and then the tac

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,440
has to decide whether they recommend

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,560
that it's a good fit for

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,920
as well because we want to stay focused

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,760
on our industry we want to stay focused

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,480
on tools where we can really bring value

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,279
so um there's that evaluation process

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,639
but that's not desi

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,880
that's designed to be completely

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,680
transparent uh the submitter can come to

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,639
those meetings

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,000
hear the discussion participate um and

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,120
then the attack makes a recommendation

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
up to the governing board and says yeah

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
we should take this one we think we

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,079
should take this one on the governing

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,360
board make sure

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,480
we can afford to basically and and gives

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,160
a thumbs up

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
so that's the rough process there's some

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,880
online documentation for that which we

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,399
can point people to

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,480
actually john maybe you can even paste

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,320
it into the chat the main landing page

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
for submitting a project

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,519
in terms of the forms and stuff because

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,040
there are forms to fill out but that's

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,920
kind of the small part it's big

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,440
it's much more about the discussion rob

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,000
makes it sound very advanced

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,600
um there is there is a effectively a

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,360
document where you answer a bunch of

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,000
questions and that's sort of the initial

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
the initial start to it um i think when

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,759
i did the raw

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,600
aces one i think it took me i don't know

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,639
an hour or so to sort of go through and

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,639
answer the questions and

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,880
and really what what that is is just a

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,920
means to start the conversation

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,639
um and to answer to steve's question in

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,040
the chat

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:50,560
um i i think that they're

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,000
the the things that we look for are

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,360
projects that either have you know have

00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,560
value to the wider community and are are

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,440
suffering and need support or ones

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,120
you know but we can certainly support uh

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,480
plenty of projects that have

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,279
active community members already and and

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,519
all that you're then well not all you

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,800
know

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,040
what you're then getting is this sort of

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,519
wider community of of

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,800
visibility and you know we we probably

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,320
would have to change the format of our

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,199
updates if we had 100 projects um

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,079
but but i don't think that there's any

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,600
sort of

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,839
arbitrary limit that we have on the

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,160
number of of active projects

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,000
i think we have the resources to handle

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,839
um quite a number

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,680
that's that's great to hear was when we

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,079
initially started there were some

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,040
constraints you know figuring out how a

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,480
lot of this would work

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,160
on the number of projects we initially

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,199
took out so it was just more of an

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,320
update on that

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,120
um yeah i think with

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
the build um stuff such that we we

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
thought we were gonna originally have a

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,920
huge cost

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,519
to supporting build infrastructure um

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,160
but i think that we've

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,959
uh sort of found a good balance of how

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,039
to manage that

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,039
and how to have that be uh

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,600
not such a financial burden as we

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,679
thought it might have been originally

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,880
and then so it would just be more about

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,000
maintenance and making sure we're

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,839
helping

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,600
the project as much as the project is is

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,400
benefiting

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,880
yeah we're actively you saw in that

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
slide

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
we're we're actively imagining three

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,439
more projects this year that would that

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
would make sense if it was four that'd

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,640
be fine too

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,039
um and we would not we're not bound by

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
the cost as kimball pointed out and we

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,480
actually have

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,200
one of the great things is we have uh

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,240
enough

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,400
so many um sponsors now in our group and

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,039
we anticipate growing that both general

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,679
members and

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,240
and premier members each of those groups

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,600
has

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,520
has already promised to dedicate at

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,120
least one full-time employee

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,240
or an equivalent of a full-time person

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,000
it might be two different people split

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,880
up or 10 different people split up

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,480
but um there's there's comp sponsoring

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,160
organizations who are just who are

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
looking where to put those resources on

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,480
academy software foundation projects

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,760
right now

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,120
so we right now have room to um add more

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,039
engineering days

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,880
to projects um so yeah it's actually

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,320
it's kind of a perfect time to onboard

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,679
some new ambitious

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,280
work is there a view rob on

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,919
where the resources currently are

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,840
allocated and where the gaps are

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,039
we um it's actually a topic of

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,320
discussion

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,640
if you recall when we formed the

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,919
foundation just over two years ago

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,120
we actually gave everybody a two year

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,799
window to just say contribute your

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,679
full-time employee to your full-time

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,200
equivalent to

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,960
any open source project because we

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,720
didn't have any projects on day one

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,320
and we knew we were only going to have a

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,840
small handful of projects in the first

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,840
couple of years

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,600
we're just at the end of that window now

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,200
where two years have now passed

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,360
so now in theory everyone should

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,840
redirect their ftes

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,840
to academy software foundation projects

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,559
now there has to be enough work to do

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
and there isn't

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,919
this isn't the kind of thing where the

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
academy software foundation dictates to

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,760
any of our sponsoring organization

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,919
any of our sponsoring organizations

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,520
where you have to put your fte

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,799
everybody gets to scratch their own edge

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,480
you get to decide where you put that

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,880
person

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,840
but the tac is the place that identifies

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,240
where we have

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,679
areas of need and then can say like oh

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
hey does anybody have a resource that

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,480
could help with this

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,320
and that's the whole strength of the

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
organization is being able to identify

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,120
those

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,400
sweep in offer additional resources by

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,400
highlighting these issues

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
and make sure that the companies and the

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
sponsors and the community that is most

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,000
affected and interested in those

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
problems can jump in and help out with

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,120
those

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,840
but right now it's not very formalized

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,840
at all

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,400
we are going to start asking those

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,120
questions

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,120
to our members

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,840
oops i think we might have lost david or

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,200
i did at least

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,880
but yes it's an active area of

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,720
discussion oh hopefully he'll be back

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,559
soon because he's got the poll

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,559
and in the project we're looking for

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,640
am i back yeah you're back i did good we

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,880
only lost you for a year here

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:15,200
five ten seconds okay okay okay

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,960
all right so uh maybe it's uh

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
it's a sign we need to move to the next

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,760
slide um

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,559
as we do on this topic what i wanted to

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,440
mention is that

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,720
in the second part of our forum where we

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
where presenters from the linux

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,200
foundation are going to

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,799
to present to us um there's also going

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,559
to be hints of how

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,000
and there are certain projects that

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,120
create a lot

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,320
of uh synergies and contribution from

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,320
the industry

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,679
that will happen and you know hyper

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,240
ledger for instance

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,080
is a project that hundreds and hundreds

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,520
of engineers were dedicated to

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,240
because there was a clear and present

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,640
need

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,919
for that technology in that industry so

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,200
it's also something that we want to

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,400
keep in mind that this can happen it has

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
happened in other industries could

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,280
happen in ours

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,200
as well and then it's beyond the

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,640
ftes that people companies have

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,919
committed to

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,840
it is really all hands on deck because

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,480
we need to do this all together

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,200
so the kind of project that could be

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,840
coming up as well

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,880
let me try to move this all right so

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,799
we're changing

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:34,320
context switch this is a question

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,919
about non-code open source project

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:41,679
so you've heard about about

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:45,360
movie data or asset repository

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,880
and you've not heard about a diversity

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,000
and inclusion

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,600
open charter on on this update but this

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
is also

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,080
a topic that is being discussed within

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,760
the diversity and inclusion

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,120
and so we want to to pull you into

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,799
your thought about the

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,320
foundation hosting projects

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,159
and creating projects that would be

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,520
based on the open source principle but

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,880
would not be code

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,960
and we've already done this

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,600
this fall internally at the at the board

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,880
level but we wanted to bring it to you

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,400
also our friends our friends and

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,400
families and people we trust

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,240
there are two two sides to this

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,000
this equation we were clearly

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080
the the foundation was clearly put

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,600
together to host open

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,960
source software and code

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,320
and we're all structured for that but we

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,320
are coming across these

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,640
these opportunities for asset and

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,080
and in the case of the diversity and

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,480
inclusion

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,760
the idea of an open charter that was

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
brought to us by adobe as a new member i

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,440
don't think

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,880
bill is with us today

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,320
but in a nutshell

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,360
the idea there is that companies

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,840
as rob mentioned many companies

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,520
most companies have developed their own

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,559
diversity and inclusion or

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,760
representation and equality programs

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,000
internally and they're all different

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,480
and they all have different flavors so

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,720
it looks a bit like custom code

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,240
everyone has one and it's all different

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,640
and there are companies maybe smaller

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,799
companies who also

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,600
want to um to deepen up that sort of

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,679
diversity and inclusion sensibility but

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
don't have the resource to set up a

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,679
department or

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,440
even permanent people and may want to

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,919
adopt a charter

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,279
that already exists and that is modified

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,039
over time

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,799
in a way that is similar to

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,240
the way source code is modified over

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,679
time

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,240
so one example of something that could

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,880
go

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,279
in such a charter or could be a fragment

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,400
in

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,799
such a project is something that we've

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,320
done

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,080
at disney so um we've worked for quite a

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,000
while actually with our legal

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,360
team to have an inclusion writer in our

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,440
visual effects awards and

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,880
it is slowly being implemented across

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,480
all of disney

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,720
marvel and lucasfilm projects it slowly

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,400
i say only because we wanted to give all

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,960
of the vendors who work for us

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,240
time to implement and comply but the

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,120
idea is there's five

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,799
metrics that you have to already have in

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,880
place to continue to be awarded

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,320
visual effects work from the disney

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,159
companies

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,159
with and they're achievable

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,520
and they went through quite a long

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,240
process to be

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,080
written and vetted by the legal teams so

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,559
just the fact that these five examples

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
exist

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,760
and there's legal language that's going

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,679
to be going into disney contracts

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,360
might be a useful jumping off point if

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,039
someone wanted to

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,480
have implement a similar inclusion

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,320
writer or someone just wanted to be able

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,520
to point to their lawyers and say like

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
other companies have been able to do

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,840
this i think we should be able to do

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,520
something similar

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,720
um so that and that's just one example

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,320
um the team from adobe and bill had done

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,840
a fantastic presentation on some of

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,480
their efforts some of which i thought

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,400
would be

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,520
fantastic for us to implement at our

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,360
company and

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,360
a neutral form for sharing that kind of

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,559
information even if in fragments could

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,679
be really interesting

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,200
uh it is a little bit outside of the

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,480
specific open source charter but it's

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,760
very consistent with our dni working

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,679
group which has had really

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,760
broad support and has i think has been a

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,960
unique uh way that we can contribute

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,279
back to the industry

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,919
but worth worth chatting about very

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,919
specifically

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,279
um there there's a few um people who

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,400
have

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,320
said possibly or i don't think so if

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,600
if you wanted to share your opinion that

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,400
would be very valuable

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,240
um in in that

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,320
yeah i mean i i put possibly just

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,870
because that's a pretty wide range of

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,960
things and i think it would depend on

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,240
[Music]

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,360
which of them they are so

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,480
i you know i think prop not just to

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,480
speak too much for everyone

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
else who could possibly but you know

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,440
it's it's like you want to say yes but

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,720
there may be some particular projects

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,360
and resources where

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,799
it might make lessons or be like to

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,799
rob's earlier point

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,840
be less beneficial for this body to

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,840
tackle that issue

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,480
thank you for that so i think we're our

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,480
takeaway is that

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,000
there's a positive sentiment but we need

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,760
to be more specific

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,440
than just a question about what the

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,080
project would be and i think there

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,360
probably

00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,080
would be a lot good good work to do to

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,440
to define the mechanism because we are

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,200
we have them down for

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,919
software by now but for other form of

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,919
assets or content we need to define them

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,240
so it makes sense

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,240
positive sentiment recorded

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,080
okay now here's a wide one

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,200
share your thoughts about the challenges

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,960
and opportunities for the film industry

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,960
after the pandemic disruption

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,799
and that would be very wide and we want

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,360
to

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,120
narrow that that question about what can

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,320
we do about it

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,799
within the foundation so

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,080
this year there was the pandemic that

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,840
created havoc

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,559
and changes and disruptions and

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,240
opportunities

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,880
in the year what are they

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,240
particularly from the point of view of

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,320
the foundation

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:05,440
in your work every day

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,559
that you've seen and everyone in

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,279
in this farm has had to adapt

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,159
their work to new way of working is

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,200
there something the foundation can do

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,960
in our open source model

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:31,840
to help our industry beyond what we've

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:31,840
already been talking about so far

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:54,159
think about where we were a year ago

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:58,640
and meeting in person at the

00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:01,279
academy museum and um

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,679
where we are now and how things have

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,679
evolved

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,360
um it's right now i think it's useful to

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,000
think about that one that's bubbling to

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,919
the top don't

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,279
start don't stop adding new ones because

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,240
i think other things will bubble to the

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,279
top

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:24,960
um i i've been very involved in

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:28,080
content security guidelines at in in

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,720
a couple different places my initial

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,120
thought is

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,399
the academy software foundation wouldn't

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,080
be a good

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,360
place to advocate for long-term

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,120
guidelines since that's going to be

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,399
driven by

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,360
um probably mpaa and the way that they

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,080
distribute that out to their

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,080
organizations

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,480
and i don't know if we want to be a

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,640
what's the right name for the one of

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,480
those organizations i don't know whether

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,799
or not we want to

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,000
take our eye off of contributing on open

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,640
source and turn to

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,799
what is what tends to be a very

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,600
political choice of

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,520
political discussion about what the

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,320
right trade-off is between security and

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,240
flexibility

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,840
and production flexibility and those are

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,840
really important discussions

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
and of course we collectively have

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,880
opinions about that and could represent

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,000
them as a body

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,520
but i wonder how important it is like we

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
have the right people in the room but is

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,080
it the right focus for

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,399
the academy software foundation is my

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,399
question

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:36,559
i'm happy to hear the counter argument

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:38,880
by the way

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,640
it we're largely a technical body and i

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,640
i could imagine us contributing to the

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,880
technical side of that conversation

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,320
sort of as you know similar to

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,039
the union of concerned scientists

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,559
commenting on a policy

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,520
idea yes yeah i i think this ties in a

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,600
bit to the

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,399
prior question which speaks to whether

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,519
we're looking to identify

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,440
the aswf as a body that takes on

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,000
non-code based

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,760
initiatives working groups what have you

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,519
and so to that end if we are

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,880
expecting or thinking that could include

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,880
guidance around

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,640
security like technical approaches to

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,440
security concerns

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,120
uh and and have that be something we

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,600
take on i think it dovetails with the

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,519
prior

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,519
question yeah

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,120
on the content security guidelines

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,000
specifically i think there's also some

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,960
other bodies who are

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,039
doing work in the area like in related

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,240
areas or directly like

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,080
movie labs or atc or pbs there are some

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,960
others already

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,559
tackling some aspects and retooling you

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,200
know based on the

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,960
work from home pandemic changes so it

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,799
may not make sense for that reason as

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,120
well

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,240
i could see the ves for example making a

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,559
strong pitch

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,840
to allow for better work life balance

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,039
for visual effects artists and being

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,600
able to come in with a very strong

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,519
opinion

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,519
i could see us to eric's point providing

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,799
a strong technical point of view about

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,799
how to do that securely or how to

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,640
improve security or even have a project

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,399
that does specific things related to

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,679
specific security concerns

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,760
but i think it would be harder for us to

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,120
take a strong point of view about you

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,880
know from one perspective of the other

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,360
either from the studio perspective which

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,120
is

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,760
which might be more might be inclined to

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,320
be more restrictive or from the

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,080
a vendor or an artist perspective or an

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,159
engineer perspective that might

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,799
be inclined to be less restrictive but

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,799
more flexible

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,679
to that end do we have any precedent for

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,640
collaborating with other bodies

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,679
on joint efforts like i could see us for

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
example

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,440
working with ves or or you know even

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,600
movie labs on

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,200
uh their 30-year vision as relates to

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,919
content security guidelines

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,799
and us you know helping to provide

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,200
either

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,399
actual projects that we can implement

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,799
that have real code

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,840
in order to assist in in certain aspects

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,000
of that

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,000
whereas you know we rely on those other

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,720
bodies for their thought leadership and

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
other you know kind of soft uh motions

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,440
is that

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,679
i know it's a loaded question but is

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,519
that something that would fit with our

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,159
our mandate and give us an opportunity

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,399
to drive collaborations

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,240
yes i think the the vfx reference

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,159
platform is probably a good example of

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,760
that relationship including with the ci

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,120
cd group and

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,480
essentially setting the standard and

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,320
then addressing from a software

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,640
foundation point of view how you apply

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,919
it

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,440
what are the software projects you

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,640
encourage around it and i think what rob

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,679
said around the uh

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,080
the security side makes sense where

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,600
the vs tech committee has you know

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,440
dabbled in some aspects of

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,840
security guidelines as well as during

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,600
covid kind of the repository for some of

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,600
the information of what people are

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,679
what solutions people are leveraging and

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,679
i can imagine there being a point where

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,600
an open source or a set of open source

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,799
projects can actually help

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,880
um shore up content and security

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,480
in one way or another or facilitate work

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,240
from home and that's where the software

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,119
foundation would come into play

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,320
based on um kind of working groups on

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,720
the ves side

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,679
partnering with the mpa and other bodies

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,200
that would drive

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,839
the kind of hard requirements and

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,839
constraints that we have to operate

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
under

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,800
that makes sense we have

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,200
part of our our associate members

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,919
we have now many many groups like the

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,800
bes

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,800
and and others who are also part of our

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,240
foundation who took notice of our work

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,159
on open source

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,079
like the etc for instance the

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,200
entertainment technology center

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,800
of usc think tank and simti

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,359
is also a member now of our foundation

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,320
because they open source is becoming a

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,400
thing for them

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,680
and instead of creating from scratch

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,599
something new they joined us and

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,520
there is a potential for collaboration i

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,480
wouldn't say that we have collaborated a

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,599
lot

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,599
with these organizations at this time we

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,839
focused on our core work

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,920
but for for topics like that one

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,320
if there was something we can do from

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,800
our part

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,640
to work with with others we're set up

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:33,040
for that

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,040
with our associate members potentially

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,800
so to to comment briefly on it

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,119
i do can see a case where

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,480
there are things that maybe the software

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,640
foundation

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:52,079
might not want to take on but

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,040
can see a need that directly relates to

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,800
technology

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,640
to empower some of the things that you

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,839
would otherwise try to do

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,880
so to to amplify on what eric is

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,320
saying had said i think having a way

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,760
that the foundation could call

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,160
for an industry

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,200
you know voice or activity without

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,400
actually

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,880
being the place where it gets done that

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,560
could actually turn out to be important

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,960
and something to be considered

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,960
i think

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,240
that makes sense thank you for that

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,839
great

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,160
um a little further down the list

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,720
somebody said facilitator

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,640
vetting for internal approval of open

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,880
source use requests

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,839
i have an idea what that might be but i

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,079
wondered if you

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,520
if whomever contributed that or voted on

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,680
it might

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,640
want to elaborate a little bit that that

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,320
was me

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,640
uh carrie phillips

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,800
you know the the life of a modern

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,599
software engineer is

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,520
navigating a maze of dependencies

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,160
between open source

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,800
packages all of which require some kind

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,000
of

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,520
internal legal approval before use

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,640
and that that use can often be

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,160
that that approval can often take months

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,520
of back and forth

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,880
with you know interacting with your

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,000
internal legal department

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,000
um that is overwhelmed with requests and

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,839
and all that if there's any way that the

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,880
foundation could serve as a kind of

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,280
clearinghouse

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,320
of stamp of approval on licensing for

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,400
open source projects yeah

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,400
i know that one of our ideas by having

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,240
the consistent licensing language

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,760
in or as consistent as possible

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,320
licensing languages and our projects

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,000
would be

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,520
like hey if it's an if it's an academy

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,079
software foundation project it's easy to

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,359
adopt

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
but i think what you're saying is could

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,119
that go one step further could there be

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,040
another 40 libraries

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,480
that the academy software foundation has

00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,280
has looked at and said like these

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,119
licensing

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,560
terms are substantially similar to ours

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,000
if we could do something like that that

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,680
would that make it easier for

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,720
organizations to adopt

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,320
open source libraries and and patterns

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,960
into their workflow that's a really

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,160
interesting idea and a big project

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,599
i wonder if i wonder if a related idea

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,560
is um a similar uh open

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,880
charter uh to help these companies set

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,960
up

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,200
uh their own you know open source

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,960
program office that can

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,320
you know kind of have an organized way

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,760
to expedite

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,720
like the process that they used

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,880
internally for use contribution and

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,920
sponsoring projects which you know

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,160
sometimes can

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,079
like it can take a long time to get

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,400
one's own company to

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,280
kind of turn that into a reliable you

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,839
know process

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,800
um and and maybe there's some knowledge

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,880
that can be shared

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,640
there between the companies and that you

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,680
know any one company's legal department

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,280
can see oh

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,800
you know these other eight companies

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,839
decided this thing was safe to do we

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,839
should do that too

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,599
yes we have a segment about open source

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,200
program office coming up

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,480
larry good good intro to that

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,000
and i think something like that would be

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
requirement before we could do anything

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,720
like that linux distribution

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,960
project so it's a good thing to think

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,960
about

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,480
very good we have three minutes left if

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,560
i got that right

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,560
in our q a um

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,920
period and so we're going to end with

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,079
the

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,400
general question is there any other

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,839
topic that we have not covered

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,160
in this in this

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,599
open discussion so far that you would

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,400
like to bring to our attention

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,960
and that is the place where anything

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,960
that we have

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,359
that that we have not covered is the

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,800
time to to bring it up or if you want to

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,040
double click on that

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:11,680
on the topic that we brought in the

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:15,760
presentation that we had this morning

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:20,160
and if not no other topic

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:24,079
we can take a two-minute break

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,040
and be back with the second part of our

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,520
of our forum which will be hosted by

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:39,839
john

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:39,839
vertic we do have something coming up

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,599
that's a good question the second one

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,040
came up about should we just employ

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,640
software engineers directly to

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,040
contribute to projects

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,920
it's really we don't see it as our

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,560
primary

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,560
way of supercharging these projects

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,960
our sponsors our our members

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,720
can um can contribute as many hours

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,079
engineering hours and other hours that

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,560
are necessary to bring these projects to

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,720
life

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,760
as makes sense and our job is to

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,599
facilitate that

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,880
and to supercharge those hours so when

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,200
you spend an hour doing work

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,960
it's really valuable time spent and to

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,480
try to facilitate the cross-platform

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,480
communication all those other things

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,319
if we take our budget that is

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,160
substantial for those things which right

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,160
now is about a million dollars a year

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,160
and started hiring engineers you know

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,839
how few engineers that would

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,599
that would be and then that would that

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,359
would spend most of our resources

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,760
so we have a um our

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,520
the whole idea about the open source

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,200
structure is to find the sponsors that

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,440
want to contribute those hours

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,119
and to facilitate that to make that

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,640
healthy industry but not necessarily to

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,720
go

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,000
scratching our itches as a foundation

00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,839
but rather let our members

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,520
contribute what makes the most sense

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,440
there

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,200
it's a really good question though and

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,520
it's not to say that we would never hire

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,440
an engineer to do an hour of coding or

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,359
at all because if there was a huge

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,119
bottleneck and everyone was waiting on

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,040
it and none of our

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,240
sponsoring organizations or any other

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,520
people in our community had that

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,760
expertise

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,440
we could unblock it with some money if

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,599
necessary but

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,720
that would probably be the exception uh

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,560
in terms of the

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,280
most efficient way to structure

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,319
everyone's contributions

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,319
if you look at the amount of money

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,599
people put in compared to the amount of

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,520
value people are putting in

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,359
in terms of hours you know the bigger

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,480
contribution is absolutely the number of

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:45,839
hours and that's what we're trying to

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,839
optimize everything for

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,480
i love the idea of focusing on real time

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,599
such a big area and how we can

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,599
best facilitate that

00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,920
depending upon what the focus is there's

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,599
a there's an existing project in the

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,160
linux foundation real-time linux that

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,839
maybe

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,599
there's some tie-ins there i don't know

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,680
kind of the space it's not the

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,720
it's not the same we're talking about

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,560
the real-time 3d

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,839
rendering and they're about that

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,800
real-time operating system which is

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,040
awesome but not

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,359
not the same really the same gotcha all

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,839
right no worries

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,280
um but do does anybody who've uploaded

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,400
that or wrote it want to chat a little

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,000
bit about what they are

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,839
thinking to and how we might be able to

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,839
most contribute

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,440
uh yeah so i just added that one i think

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,520
it's just a really

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,040
exciting area in the industry at the

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,720
moment and there's just

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,240
as you say there's so many possibilities

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,880
to explore

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,920
um and at access we're really keen to

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,599
kind of

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,440
deep dive into different ways that we

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,040
can incorporate real-time engine

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,400
technology into

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,560
different parts of our production

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,200
process seeing how we can

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,800
really innovate in those areas so it

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,920
could be a really exciting

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,160
kind of area to explore in the academy

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,000
as well

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,119
it's great in an environment that is

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,240
very dynamic

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,720
the challenge is to identify

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,359
pieces that can be open source in the

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,160
early days

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,440
it's perhaps the open exr challenge we

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,920
can

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,119
that was done right with open exr there

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,319
was a number of

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,640
features that were identified as key

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,000
that everybody would use and that could

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,160
be open source

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,760
and what's happening now with the

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,359
explosion of real-time

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:40,880
technologies is to finding that

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:43,200
those libraries that identify them

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,160
is the challenge when everything is

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,160
changing so fast

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,839
all right well we're two minutes over

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,640
so in the 30 seconds

00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,480
john isle i'll give you back the

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,520
the deck so that you can proceed with

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,839
the second segment of our farm awesome

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,599
awesome thank you so much uh david the

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,440
morning set this first session has been

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,079
really really good thank you everyone

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,920
who has uh participated provided some

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,680
feedback and ideas i know this is this

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,200
giving the entire project things to chew

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,520
on

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:30,560
let me go ahead and take back

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,560
