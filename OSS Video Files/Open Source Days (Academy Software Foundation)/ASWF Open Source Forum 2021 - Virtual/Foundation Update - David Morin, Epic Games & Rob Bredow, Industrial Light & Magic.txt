	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,600
so um i want to welcome everyone

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,800
to our open source forum 2021

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,920
which is our third open source film

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,960
in the history of our foundation and

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,160
that's the place

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,119
where in the year where we

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,560
gather ourselves everybody who works in

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,519
the foundation

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,720
from the board to the tech to the the

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,320
working groups and

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,840
and everyone working along with our

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,239
our friends and family and the people

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,360
who

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,280
helped us get started at the beginning

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,640
through the investigation

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,079
that led to the foundation and that may

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,760
not be in

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,520
working actively in a capacity or

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,640
another in the foundation

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,960
and by and large the goal

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,640
is when we met in person was to have an

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,480
interactive discussion we're presenting

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
things in an update about where we've

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,720
been and what we've done

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,439
but it's really with the goal of picking

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,880
the brain

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,240
of our um of everyone

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,880
once a year to um to look at what we're

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,080
doing

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,119
step back a little bit and say ask

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
ourselves

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,880
um what else we should be doing or how

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,040
should we do things differently

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
and um and i have to say that this year

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,479
was

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,360
a year of great change in the industry

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,360
and in the world because of the pandemic

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,119
but our industry our film industry was

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,479
impacted

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,600
quite a bit even compared to others

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,399
with the the closure of the cinemas main

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
venue for

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:52,079
a big part of the film industry um

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:55,119
and so that creates a very dynamic and

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,079
different environment in front of us

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,280
now that it looks like we're getting out

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,960
of the pandemic hopefully

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079
fingers crossed so today we're going to

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,280
review

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,560
where we've been and we're going to do a

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,599
q a session and in the second part

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
of the of the of the day

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,959
we're also going to have presentations

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,120
from the linux foundation

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,640
that has still to this day a lot to

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,000
offer that we've not

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,440
mined in terms of information and

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,440
experience and so um

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,480
we've curated some presentation there

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,360
with jim zemlin and a few others

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,599
to give us a window in what's going on

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,959
in other parts of the open source world

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,239
as we consider what to do with our

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,239
with our foundation moving forward

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,280
so are we at the right count john is it

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,280
a good

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,959
time to start yeah i'd say let's get

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,319
started here i think uh yeah we have

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,680
just about the half of the pursuit of

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,720
the registrant so i'm sure more will

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,800
trickle in

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,640
so okay all right so the meeting is on

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,200
um on zoom and as you see on the slide

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,440
we we've done a few meetings on zoom and

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,959
remotely before

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,720
some of them were not very interactive

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,760
and we got some feedback about that so

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,519
this is a

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,319
pure zoom meeting so we ask yourself to

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,080
you can use the chat room to introduce

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,200
yourself

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,440
and you can raise your hand to speak

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,440
please monitor your your mute button in

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,920
a large group like this

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,959
so that when you're not speaking you're

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,720
on mute

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,239
and but we also want to to encourage

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,159
the more interactive

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,360
um back and forth in this meeting

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,840
so excuse me no problem here i'll just

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,000
oh

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
yeah we thought it might be fun just if

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
a lot of us know each other but we i

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,439
don't think i know everybody in this

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,959
room

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,879
so it might be fun if you just on the

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,159
chat want to introduce yourself maybe

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,400
where you work or how you got to know

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,439

bit different than years past we have

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,199
some great experts here that are going

to help give you

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,759
insight on open source program offices

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,199
how other foundations that are at

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
similar stages

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,240
to the academy software foundation have

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,759

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,039
linux foundation

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,639
and he's going to reflect on just some

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,000
of the successes that he has seen from

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,680
his perspective

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
from the academy software foundation in

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,479
the last three years

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,000
and you know just kind of make a

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,800
connection i mean he's been around this

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,360
industry he's

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,039
he's seen foundations like this at

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,039
earlier stages this stage

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,560
and then past stages and he has some

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,720
really cool insights to

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
to share about what he's seen both with

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,120
linux foundation other foundations

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,880

into your own

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,680
organizations as you're building your

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,000
for those of you who have been to a

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,960
number of these the morning sessions are

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
going to be

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,599
more similar to the things we've done

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,039
before but hopefully it'll still be a

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
lot of interesting valuable information

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,520
and

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,199
go over things you haven't heard about

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,360
but the afternoon in particular

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,560
hopefully is very very valuable to you

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,759
or it's not really the afternoon the

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
rest the second half of the morning i

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,560
think is going to be

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,759
all fresh content nothing you have seen

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,440
nothing like what we've done before and

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,680
i think it'll be really valuable

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
so let's dive in talk a little bit about

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
the foundation

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,599
uh and what the current updates are um

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440
i'm going to do some because i see many

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,800
of you are pretty familiar i'm going to

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,200
go through some of this quickly

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
if it feels like repeat but but not

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,839
everyone here knows everything about

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,240
what we're doing so i'll make sure to

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,159
cover

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
our bases at least briefly but if you

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
have any questions just drop it into the

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,680
chat

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
so open source software is everywhere

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
from

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,480
you know your web browser to packages

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,640
like blender

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
i first got familiar with the way

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,600
companies are running

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,800
open source around wordpress which

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,120
powers 40 percent

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,440
of the web and they give away their core

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,880
product their core code is open source

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,240
so i was really curious how that

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,720
actually worked and when i say it's

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
everywhere it's truly in every industry

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,000
these are just some of the main packages

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,880
that the linux foundation

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
supports so you can see that just the

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,959
number

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,320
the vast number of important libraries

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,120
that are foundational the way the

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
internet works

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,040
but also the way cars work and through

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,080
the way film works are all powered

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,680
by open source early on

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,360
in our investigation we asked the

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
question of of a group assembled like

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
this

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,680
how many of you open use open source

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,000
software and 84 percent of the group

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,640
said

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,040
yes we do use open source software in

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
our

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
in our in the motion picture industry or

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
in our part of the motion picture

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,800
industry

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
i would advocate that probably the other

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,959
16 do but just don't know which package

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
they're using because almost everything

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,880
we do is built in some ways on open

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,440
source

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,360
and if you look back over the last 20

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,320
years we've had a number of

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
generous actors in this space sponsoring

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
companies

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,680
in the entertainment industry who've

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,519
created key open source technologies

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,160
key open source libraries that have

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,240
benefited the entire industry

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,160
and by open sourcing these projects

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
they've gotten a lot of adoption

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,079
many of them have become de facto

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,399
standards in our industry

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,240
in addition the authors in a lot of

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
cases have gotten academy awards

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,519
uh and that has strengthened our

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,560
connection to the academy for sure

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,560
um so and this has been um

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,320
because these pro packages have been so

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,839
well adopted and

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,880
very well designed they've they've

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,640
that's that huge reach in our industry

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,399
some of you in this room have won

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,760
academy awards for your software

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,079
here so why do companies even

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,440
use why why did we why did we have that

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,959
why do we have these generous companies

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,839
contributing these open source libraries

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
to the industry

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
there's a lot of reasons but one of them

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,240
is proprietary tools

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,880
have a cost they cost money to develop

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
to maintain to document to train you

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,079
know there's

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,279
times that it's still worth it to have a

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,640
proprietary

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,560
in-house tool of course but you have to

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,839
count all of these costs

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,200
when you do that and sometimes you want

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,760
to keep something proprietary for a

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
while

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
but then at some point these costs

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,519
become a little bit overbearing

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
the nice thing about an open open source

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,600
ecosystem is you are really

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,440
sharing those costs across a brighter a

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,279
broader group of folks

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,120
so you can share the development the

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,680
maintenance the documentation the

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,560
training

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,200
there's nothing like when we were at

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,040
sony

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
and had written open shading language

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,279
there's nothing like being able to hire

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
a shader writer

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,880
off from an experienced shader writer

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,920
from somewhere who's already familiar

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,519
with your shader writing

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
language instead of having to become an

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,360
expert in your in-house

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
let's say obscure c-plus plus stuff

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,320
where you make one mistake and it can

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,240
crash a 10-hour render

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
with open shading language you no longer

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,760
face that same problem so

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,920
being able to share these costs can be a

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,480
huge efficiency improvement

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,120
for a studio or for a filmmaking company

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,600
it's also very professionally satisfying

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,040
for

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,440
your developers sometimes developers

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,079
aren't

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,560
able to easily get film credits or even

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,600
necessarily point to one particular shot

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,200
that they worked on like artists can

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,399
it might be they may feel like they're

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,519
not working on things that are as

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,880
externally visible

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,800
usually so it's a little harder to get

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,160
recognition from their peers in the

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
industry

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,519
but when you're working on an open

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,200
source project your work is out

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,639
in the open there is something you can

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
point to and your peers can actually see

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,120
your work

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,120
and that has two effects i think

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,800
developers like that it's good for their

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,839
careers it's good for their development

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,959
um it's also i think from uh from a

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,440
person who

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,120
manages teams of developers it's also uh

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,680
selfishly very motivating

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,959
for for if you're looking to improve the

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,320
quality of your code because

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,240
there's nothing like knowing someone's

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,480
going to be looking at your code

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,600
to to to encourage you to put extra

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
effort into

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,480
making sure that code is something

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,880
you're really proud of so i really

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
believe

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,000
by building open source projects we

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,320
actually get better

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,320
implementations of software

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,120
open source is truly an innovation

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
accelerator and we've certainly seen

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
that

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,320
in our industry and there's all these

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,839
reasons there's these

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
you know this this is just ten examples

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,200
but there's actually even more

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
you know minimizing fragmentation is a

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,880
huge thing we all know

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,000
the cost of adopting a new technology is

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,360
high

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,680
and if you have a lot of choices out

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,120
there you really do slow down the pace

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,600
of innovation

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,680
it enables new business opportunities

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,639
and we already talked about things like

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,000
shared cost of development but all these

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,680
things

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,760
come together to really be an innovation

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,800
multiplier and that's what we're seeing

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,399
at the academy software foundation

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,880
so why why did we actually need if we

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
already had these generous actors

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,920
companies that were sponsoring these

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
programs in the space why did we

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,560
actually need a foundation to come

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,680
together a decision we made a couple

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
years ago

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,399
and it turns out there are some issues

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,639
that are much harder to solve

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,000
even with great corporate sponsors

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,800
acting as individuals

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,760
and it's much easier to solve as a

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
independent or

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,240
neutral foundation these companies

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
who were sponsoring these programs they

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,720
were actually all happy to get along

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
they were talking to each other trying

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,199
to coordinate

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
but it's really tricky people in

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,440
different time zones getting people

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,839
together

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,600
prioritizing development dedicating

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,279
resources even just to manage these pull

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
requests

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,880
that can easily fall between the cracks

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,000
between two organizations without

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
someone in the middle

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519
to help manage this and this is what

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,880
we've seen so far and also

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,480
like some of these things like a shared

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,680
legal framework really hard to get

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,279
consensus

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,560
unless you have somebody in the center

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,120
managing that and that's what we've been

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,320
able to

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,920
do as the academy software foundation

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
the foundation's also able to build a

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
single continuous integration and build

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
infrastructure

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,959
so then all of our projects can be built

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,279
from source with a button push or

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,279
at the moment you check code in rather

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,800
than having to

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,000
rely on lots of different independent

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,920
build environments that are all going to

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,120
be varied

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,600
oh in addition that ci infrastructure is

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,040
also

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
open source of course so you can

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,199
leverage it if you like it you can

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,120
leverage it in your own ecosystems

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,160
um this third point was a big one and it

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
was one of the things we were talking

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,480
about

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,720
in the at the formation of the academy

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,519
quite a lot

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
open exr is a good example because it's

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
it's actually

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,079
was originally hosted by the company i

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,600
work for now industrial light and magic

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,839
and it has had a long history in our

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,399
industry it's been very very successful

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,079
it's one of the examples i point to as a

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,399
successful open source project

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,279
because even though openexr was

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,120
developed

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,920
first on linux and was primarily for the

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
film industry

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,000
it's so ubiquitous now when you get an

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,160
exr file and you hit a space bar on your

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,040
mac it opens up the exr file and it's

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,279
displayable

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,480
because the apple built it into their

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,000
operating system so

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,920
it's pretty amazing to have that level

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,440
of integration of the library that could

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,199
have otherwise been

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
pretty obscure but instead now it's

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,959
gotten a huge amount of adoption

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,920
so as successful as exr was there wasn't

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,320
a clear path

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,680
for companies to submit contributions

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
back and get them quickly integrated

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,079
back into the package

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,759
so the weta had done some additions to

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,600
exr and it was a long path

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,880
to get it integrated before we had the

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,079
academy software foundation and you'll

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,160
see examples

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
later about how that has been massively

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
streamlined now that we have the

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,040
foundation

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,240
in place so a clear path if you want to

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
put investment into one of these

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,399
libraries

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,839
you know that you can get your

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
investment paid off meaning you can get

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,480
your investment integrated

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
because you know what the process is for

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,120
getting those um

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,839
those contributions accepted and the

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,440
last

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
area we did a lot of talking about

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,480
before we founded the found

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,199
before we formed the foundation was

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,199
virginitis and this is a problem that

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,120
the visual effects society has done a

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,880
lot of work towards helping with

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,399
which is making sure that all these

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
different libraries are actually

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,959
interrupting

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,559
interoperability with each other

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,360
interrupting interoperable with each

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,880
other

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,559
they can work together and you know what

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,839
version of the operating system is

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,240
that it's available that you can run it

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,600
with um so

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,520
we certainly haven't completely solved

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,760
this problem but the

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,679
the academy software foundation in

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,559
collaboration with the visual effects

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,839
society

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,880
project on the uh ref i'm blanking on

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,080
the name right now

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,480
the vfx reference platform project has

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,559
really

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,200
started to make a real dent in this in

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,200
this right now

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,400
so we founded the academy software

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,960
foundation as a partnership

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
between the academy and the linux

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,400
foundation

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,720
and that's what we have today that last

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,400
graph that i was showing you that chart

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,320
that showed those projects that was 20

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,240
years roughly 20 years of open source

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,840
software development in our industry

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,000
and here you can see just in the last

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,000
two years how

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
many more things have been going on and

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
this isn't everything i had to take

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,840
things off this chart because it gets

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,280
too full

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,080
but we were founded in 2018

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,799
after the scitec council concluded their

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,720
investigation

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,720
and recommended that we form the academy

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,160
software foundation we had a bunch of

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,360
founding members and we've grown that

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,080
membership

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,520
foundation since then and then the you

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,960
can see the adoption date

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,799
of the various projects that we are

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
going to be talking about today and we

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,320
have

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,320
more on the horizon so a lot going on

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,320
here is our the list of our members

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
grouped into different groups the

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,760
premier members

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,520
are the ones who have a seat at the

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,720
board each have have a seat on the board

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,440
and on the tac

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,520
and have contributed most significantly

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,480
financially and with a full-time

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,000
dedicated full-time what we call one fte

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,760
one full-time equivalent

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,160
person to actually work on these

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,200
projects in our foundation

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,160
so we are incredibly appreciative of

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,799
our members support the general members

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,080
contribute

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,559
less financially and but are very very

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
involved

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,559
and then as a group the general

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,080
membership the general members have some

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
representation on the governing board

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,440
and attack as well and then our

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,320
associate members are non-profit

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,240
organizations

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
who we have also partnered with as

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,520
members so

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,720
thank you very much if you're here

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,160
representing

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,200
one of these companies we're incredibly

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,919
gracious we always say explicitly

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
oh we have 26 members this year oh sorry

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,280
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,960
last year we have 30 this year so we

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,080
continue to grow our membership which is

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
fantastic

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,280
and that is where our financial support

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,360
comes from we have a budget of over

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
about a million dollars right now which

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,080
is great and enables a lot of the work

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,799
you're going to see

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,840
today so again thank you and just to be

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,400
explicit

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,360
you don't have to be a member to attend

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
tax meetings

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,679
or to contribute or to use the software

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,600
the software remains free

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,840
but as a member you are able to help

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,640
steer the direction of the funds

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,640
and uh and you enable this community

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,280
which i think is very very beneficial

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,840
and hopefully more than pays for itself

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,840
each year

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,000
so we want to have a really clear

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,720
mission and we do it's to increase the

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,039
quality

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,760
and the quantity of open source in our

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,440
industry

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,280
by by solving some of these things we're

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,760
just talking about a clear governance

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
model

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
meaning how we govern these projects

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
make sure there's a clear path to

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,280
adoption those kind of things so people

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,320
know how to get their

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,360
changes added to the software provide a

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,120
legal framework

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,799
that reduces liability for all of our

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,280
companies and contributors

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,000
while at the same time making it easy to

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,159
change

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,520
and access and use our software we're

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,159
looking for

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,840
adoptability and then providing that

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,760
shared infrastructure we talked about

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,880
a build infrastructure that's in place

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
it works actually really well there's

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,000
always more we can do to it

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,280
we're talking about new features and new

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
build targets

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,200
every day but that share community

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,919
infrastructure so people can have a

00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
place where

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,520
if you want to make a simple change you

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,360
do not have to be an expert at how to

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,520
set up these build systems you can just

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,000
make a simple change to the software

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,360
test and rebuild it and those changes

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,400
can be incorporated into the

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,320
future version all of this together

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,679
lowering the barrier making it easier

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,440
for the belt developing

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,919
and using open source software in our

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,919
industry

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,840
and this is a little more detail about

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,559
how we

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,679
actually approach this we want to have a

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,360
neutral form we want to have a place

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,720
that is not representative of any single

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,720
company but all of the companies

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,919
and all of the community that is really

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,679
interested in open source

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,039
in our industry and then you can see a

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,080
little bit more detail

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,799
down below i think many of you as i look

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,559
through

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,640
this list i think many of you are quite

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,840
familiar with some of the actual

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,600
specifics and we're going to get much

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,400
more specific about the projects and the

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,400
updates from there

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,039
as david referenced this is how we're

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,640
structured our technical advisory

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,400
council the big box in the middle

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,919
is really the heart and soul of the

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,039
academy software foundation this is

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,360
where

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,080
the collaboration between the projects

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
can happen

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,000
this is where new working groups are

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,440
initiated this is where new projects are

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,640
recommended for acceptance

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,360
into the foundation that tack

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,640
is really the heartbeat of the

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,240
organization

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,559
the attack is supported by the governing

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,200
board and i chair the governing board

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,400
that's where we

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,240
make sure we have enough money to fund

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
the the mission of the tax we approve

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,919
things that cost money

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,840
and what else do we do we talk about

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,760
overall strategy and direction

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,440
for the foundation at the governing

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,039
board provide that direction

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,720
and the outreach committee is incredibly

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,840
important they make things events like

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,559
today possible

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,840
and um and also have out of that has

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,039
grown our dni initiatives which we're

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,200
very excited about you're going to hear

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,679
more about today as well

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
there's six projects in the uh the

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,919
academy software

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,679
foundation today all built on that ci

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,520
platform that you can see at the bottom

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,720
we actually have a seventh on eminent

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,720
right now which is really great

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,400
uh we're gonna i'm gonna leave this for

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,320
the next presenter

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,679
to talk a little bit more in a about the

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,159
dni working group

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,679
but this is a very exciting initiative

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,360
and

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,039
if you want to read a little bit more

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,320
about di please check it out on our

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,200
website as well

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,400
but i really believe that our team our

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,000
working group who has been working on

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
this is doing fantastic work and it's

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,200
completely true what you see here

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,080
that open source really does have the

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,760
power to break down some of the barriers

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,039
that have traditionally been

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,880
holding people back from being able to

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,880
be involved in our industry and this is

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,559
a uniquely accessible onboarding tool

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,320
for people from more inclusive

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,720
backgrounds to get involved

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,480
and there's a lot of exciting work going

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,360
on in the space including scholarships

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,880
and other things

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,640
to enable people to access and to

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,120
become aware that this is a career

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
opportunity for them

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,960
especially folks who hadn't

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,679
traditionally had the opportunity or

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,159
even knew

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,200
that this was a that this was a

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,159
possibility

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,279
i really have seen that there are whole

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,840
groups of people

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,360
incredibly talented people who we've

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,960
been missing as an industry

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,559
and who have we haven't been recruiting

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,880
from and it's a big

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,400
opportunity to find amazing talent out

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,520
there so this is a great thing for our

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,120
industry and it's just the right thing

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
to do as well so i'm very very proud of

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,080
the dni

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
working group work and it's been really

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,799
fun to do a little bit of a road show

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,640
with them lately

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,840
and uh the team that is running that

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,840
group is doing a fantastic job

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,240
so this is our timeline as we look at

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,279
our current year you can see we're doing

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,600
the open source forum

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,039
today in the summer we will have open

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,080
source days like we have done

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,120
traditionally around

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,400
siggraph that'll be in august we also

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,480
are estimating that we're going to try

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,480
to bring in three new projects to the

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,960
academy software foundation this year

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,640
those are the green boxes down below

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,159
we're very excited about those

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,000
there's some events we plan to speak at

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,600
and continue to attract more

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,279
developers and people who want to

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,720
participate in the foundation

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,919
but you can see that's our rough

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,679
schedule for the year

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,960
and so you get have an idea we still

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,840
have a lot of growing and building

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
momentum

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,840
and there are lots of ways to get

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,679
involved if you aren't already hooked in

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,520
with the academy software foundation

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,679
there are lots of different ways to get

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,400
onboarded if you're a developer

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,480
or you are familiar enough with code you

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,640
want to contribute a pull request with a

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,559
bug fix or a new feature you can do that

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,240
you can do that yourself right away um

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,080
or anybody in your organizations can or

or a working group you can always jump

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,200
in we really could use some devops

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,440
expertise we always could

you don't want to ask at the moment or

00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,440
you're just thinking things uh
