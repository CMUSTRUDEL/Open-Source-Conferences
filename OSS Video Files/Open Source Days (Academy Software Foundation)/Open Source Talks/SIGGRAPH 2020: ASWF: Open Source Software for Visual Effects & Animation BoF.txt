with the foundation um

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,240
the um and then in this short segment

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,880
i'm going to talk about

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:02,479
how um our we came from where we're at

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,600
and we had the poll already so

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,639
um and the first thing we want to show

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,840
is a short showreel that

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,880
will that has been built

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
around projects that used the open

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,560
source

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,960
projects that are hosted at the academy

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,600
software foundation

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,880
and as i do that

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,880
you will forgive me for a second

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,880
i'll go in and out

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
and share with sound

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:50,479
so that we're back with the video

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,560
every single part of the filmmaking

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,000
process is touched by software

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,080
and a lot of that software is open

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
source software the academy software

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
foundation

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,479
exists to provide a great home for open

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:16,660
source projects

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:22,850
that we as an industry use every day

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:22,850
[Music]

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
[Music]

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,919
[Music]

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,680
whether you are a user of open source

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,520
software or an engineer

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,879
or a company that relies on open source

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,840
software we want to create the right

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,199
ecosystem

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,130
for you to get the most out of the open

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,809
source software that you need to use

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,809
[Music]

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,520
and so the academy software foundation

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,279
um where does it come from um many of

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,479
you i'm sure have followed our progress

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
and you're aware of the

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,839
history for those of you who are just

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,000
coming to

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,000
be in touch with the foundation here's a

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,120
quick recap a quick timeline of our

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
progress

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,640
um the foundation came out of an

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,040
investigation

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,959
that took place at the academy sci tech

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,480
council for about two years

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,800
and an investigation that was focused

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,399
on the role of open source software in

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,480
the motion picture industry

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,160
and the conclusion was to create an

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,200
organization that would help

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,440
develop open source further and

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,480
in august 10 2018 two years ago now

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
the foundation was created by this group

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
of companies

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,000
that you see there are founding members

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,120
companies that

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,399
decided to not only do something about

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
open source um

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,080
in in creating an organization but also

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
committed fund

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,839
to get it started these were our

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
founding members were eternally grateful

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,440
to them

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,080
and then shortly thereafter um we had

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,360
our first

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
project openvdb that was gifted to the

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,080
foundation

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,680
by dreamworks animation which is the

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,560
process by which a project

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,519
comes to the foundation it has to be

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,399
given

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,959
to the foundation by the company that

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,240
owns

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,000
the open source ip and a new set of

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,040
members joined us

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,279
shortly thereafter open color i o came

00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,240
in

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,800
as our second project in february of

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,240
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,200
then open exr and openq came in

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,040
quickly in succession um openvdb came

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,839
from dreamworks as i said open colorio

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,880
from sony

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:17,360
open exr from disney um

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:20,480
and so on and then open timeline io

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,040
came to us given by pixar along with a

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
new group of members joining us

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,560
and apple and microsoft joined in

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,360
september 2019 and by that time

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,200
we reached a milestone in terms of

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,839
yearly funding of a million dollar a

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,480
year

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,200
and that's one of the many things that

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
the foundation

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,560
brought to the open source ecosystem

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,320
is a foundation in terms of dollars

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,920
and the ability to invest in the

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
ecosystem

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,880
we reached that milestone just in time

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,560
for covet 19 to hit us

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,440
all of us and although

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,560
it was impossible to plan for covet 19

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
nobody did

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,800
we were in a position at the foundation

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,000
where we were able to

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,839
to face uh the situation

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,880
and um accelerate in fact our activities

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,560
and so we have a new uh project that

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,440
joined us on april 16th

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,399
open shading language along with amd in

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
dark yard

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,320
and today at siggraph 2020 uh we

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,200
were last week at our open source day we

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,440
announced that

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
we have three new members that joined

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
the foundation

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,760
um and that in a nutshell is the

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,880
evolution of the foundation up to now

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,079
these are the companies members um of

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,279
the foundation

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,959
and you see named you may be working

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,040
with one of our member company um if you

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,200
if your company is not listed here and

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,639
um you are interested to join do not

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,839
hesitate to contact

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,680
us to contact me and we will

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,959
give you more information about the

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
process

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,240
in a nutshell the mission of the

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,320
foundation here you have it

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
it's about the governance model legal

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,800
framework and the community

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,720
infrastructure

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,519
or open source software and our goals

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,279
are to provide a neutral forum a

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,680
continuous integration

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,720
building infrastructure so that we can

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,120
share

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,519
open source build configuration so that

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,639
the participation in open source project

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,720
is clear on how to do that and we also

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,920
provide a more consistent licensing for

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,560
the industry all

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,360
items to facilitate the development and

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,440
adoption of open source software

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
open source software in our industry

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,680
there's a lot

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,120
of software in libraries we have put

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,000
together a landscape

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,839
on our website um and you can find it at

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,480
aswf.io this is an interactive landscape

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,120
where you can

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,480
explore all of these various open source

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
software that are used

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
in our industry and find out more about

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
them

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,800
so we specifically have six projects in

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,839
the foundations that have been

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,720
gifted to the foundation this is the

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,360
structure

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,200
the heart of the foundation is the

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,200
technical advisory council

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,399
this is where the engineers are the

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
people who are

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,480
writing the code for open source

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
projects they are the one who make all

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,320
the important decision

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,440
about what to do and how to drive the

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,040
development

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,760
the governing board and the outreach

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,720
committee are there to serve the tech

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
and and clear the way for them and the

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,440
tech

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,200
is building on the continuous

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,240
integration platform

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,519
that all of our project is now based on

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,440
and i want to uh introduce next for the

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,800
next segment of our presentation

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,440
danielle eckenberg who's the uh

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,720
the chair of our technical advisory

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,160
council

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,199
danielle thank you david and

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,079
great to have so many people here uh

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,959
taking an interest

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,120
in the progress of the foundation and

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,000
its projects over the last year

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,680
so as uh david alluded it's been a very

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,880
challenging time for all of us

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,360
and indeed for all of the

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,720
work that happens within our industry

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,120
and within our projects

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,160
i'm very happy to say that i think that

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
uh

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,480
our projects have done very well

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,199
throughout this period in fact uh

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,240
all of our participants have shown a

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,360
real resilience

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,399
um throughout this time and i'd like to

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,680
think that indeed

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,480
uh that is in part uh a sign

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,320
of um some of the strengths and

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
robustness of the open source process as

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
well and some

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,959
and those things that the foundation has

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,079
been able to uh really provide in terms

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,120
of

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,240
accessibility of resources and breadth

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,680
of participation in

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,800
all of our projects david next slide

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
please

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,839
so of course the real work of the

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,199
foundation is

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,639
in and around our projects and over

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,480
the lifetime of the foundation we've

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,120
been able to grow to these

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,000
six very strong and active projects

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,800
which represent

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,880
a diversity of participation the

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,120
diversity of backgrounds you'll see that

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,000
we've had projects contributed from a

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,199
number of

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,399
uh different industry

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,079
backgrounds and indeed projects which

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,760
actually serve a number of different

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,519
parts of our

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,199
you know our workflow and our problem

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,680
space

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,279
i won't speak too much about each of

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,040
those individual projects because

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,880
uh we'll be going into a lot more detail

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,160
throughout the rest of this session

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,680
and of course we have a follow-up

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,680
session where each of the projects will

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,720
themselves be able to speak

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,959
about their activity in recent

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,040
times and of course looking ahead to the

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,360
future

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,680
so a little bit more about uh the tact

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,880
then and what it means to be involved

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,759
uh within the tactic itself um

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,040
like all of our uh projects um

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,000
participation in the tac

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,759
and the processes of the tac are open

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,079
and we encourage involvement of

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,279
participation from both members of the

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
foundation

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,560
but also the broader community the tack

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,839
itself

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,839
looks to provide a space for projects to

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,959
communicate across each other and indeed

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,720
to gather participation from other

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,320
interested parties

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,880
we take on challenges like trying to

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,279
agree

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,399
on best practices on forging ahead in

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,600
areas which

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,680
affect all of our projects or perhaps

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
affect all of our industry and

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,880
participants but aren't yet part of a

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,279
project and we'll look at

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,399
the working group model which has been

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,639
something that we've been

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,519
really actively increasing over the last

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,920
year

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,120
as a mode for us to actually harness

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,839
energies

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,199
beyond and outside our individual

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,839
projects

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,639
one big area of course as well is to

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
work on

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,079
the process of making it easier for

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,519
developers

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:05,039
to engage with the industry and with our

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,160
projects that's something you'll hear a

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,400
lot more about from

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,600
our dni working group as well coming up

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,160
after my session

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:17,120
section so next slide please

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,079
so looking at how this relates in

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,400
specific terms

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,000
obviously we are very happy to be able

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,919
to draw on the research

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,120
resources and advice and guidance of our

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,799
governing board

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,360
which is chaired by rob and

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,720
of course also the support of the linux

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,880
foundation

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
who provide lots of experience from

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,440
other

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,039
open source projects and endeavors some

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
of the key processes that would really

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,520
sought

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,559
to bring consistency and

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,760
ease of access and reliability of access

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,360
are of course in uh some of the not only

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,440
the technical processes we'll hear about

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,200
the ci system for example as an example

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,840
as a good example of that but also

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,799
things like our

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,799
licensing and developer

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,919
contribution processes and i think we

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
have a slide about that in a moment just

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,760
to give an example of what that means

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
one of the things that we've really

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,600
sought to do is to

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,600
minimize the diversity of

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,600
contribution processes and licenses so

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
in most areas of course diversity is a

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,880
very good thing and we

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,840
hope to encourage it in this case we've

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,559
had

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,559
historically a little bit of a zoo of

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,000
slight variations on licenses and

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,360
contribution processes

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and this is an area where we've worked

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,440
very hard with all of our

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,280
entities and of course the experience of

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
linux foundation to try and bring that

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,440
number down

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,120
to a minimum quantity um taking

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,520
both projects that have long history

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,840
like open vdb and ipxr

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,720
and also new projects um or relatively

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,280
new projects

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,919
into a much smaller set of licenses we

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,679
have a

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,320
recommended license which is essentially

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,799
the apache 2 license for our projects

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,520
and we've moved through a couple of

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,000
iterations

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,760
of streamlining our contributor license

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,480
agreement processes so

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,600
with both a short form process and more

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,640
recently

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,640
conforming around the slight

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,919
uh what's the word slightly specified in

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,559
terms of being appropriate to our

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,600
projects

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,880
uh variant of the apache ii cla to

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,760
manage contribution licenses

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,039
so coming back to look at what our

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
working group model

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,240
actually looks like essentially working

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,120
groups are

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,120
well-defined

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,679
umbrellas for us to uh focus on a

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,559
particular area

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,280
in some cases those uh that activity

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,799
might be

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,880
long running in this in the interest of

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,360
our projects and the primary example of

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,799
that is our ci working group which

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,120
was set up to firstly establish but now

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,640
to maintain and extend the continuous

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,960
integration infrastructure that we

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,919
that we in our projects use and indeed

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,679
has has

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,280
taken on a life outside of our projects

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,640
too which i'm very happy to see

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,679
um and in other cases to try and

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,919
target perhaps more shorter term and

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,760
well-defined

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,120
challenges facing our projects in our

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,799
industry and a

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,480
good example of that is of course the

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,520
python 3 working group

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,200
which uh uses the um

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,000
space and the resources of the

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,080
foundation to provide a space for our uh

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,600
for our industry to actually collaborate

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,400
across vendors and across

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,600
studios uh to look at the specific

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,400
challenges of

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,880
transitioning from python 2 to python 3

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,280
which has

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,080
been a big endeavor that many of us have

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,360
been active on

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,960
for the past year another good example

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,080
is our usd working group which

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,320
is uh providing a space alongside of

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,360
course all of pixar's efforts with usd

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,240
uh to continue uh to support

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,640
usd and its broader adoption within the

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,640
industry

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,840
so back into a little bit more detail

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,360
about the ci working group

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,200
and so for each of these i'll flash up a

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,200
quick slide which

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,039
uh lists essentially the goals of the

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,720
working group and

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,720
i've we have a number of points of

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,960
contact but i've highlighted the slack

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,039
channels within the aswf slack which i

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,039
encourage anyone who's interested to

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,320
be involved or follow along with we've

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,559
got great activity and

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,120
engagement in all of those channels now

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,760
and they're a very nice complement to

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,200
our other regular meeting processes and

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,640
repository based

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,679
collaboration mechanisms so the ci

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,320
working group

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
has allowed us to bring together

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,120
expertise from

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,640
our projects from uh developers um

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,200
associated with our

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,760
uh member companies and beyond and of

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,159
course

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,679
some of our key foundation members who

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,200
are responsible for

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,880
uh the software packages and some of the

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,240
infrastructure we might use

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,919
and in order to provide a modern

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,919
and open source

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,000
compatible ci infrastructure outside of

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,320
any of the individual facilities where

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,600
our projects grew up

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,320
i have a slide in a moment which shows

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,520
uh how this infrastructure has evolved

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,120
we've moved from a number of different

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,320
models starting out with

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,440
a jenkins-based approach to this

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,480
configuration which is much more uh

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,880
employing sort of current and modern

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,320
software as the service components and

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,280
fits very nicely

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,159
into the github ecosystem one example of

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,799
that was

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,440
that we migrated from azure pipelines to

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,400
github actions for a very unified

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,600
ci process support within github which

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,200
is where our projects

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,159
are all hosted and one very nice thing

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,919
about this process

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,360
is that it allows for all of these

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,480
pieces to be very

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,440
uh easily seen they're all accessible

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,039
and open

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,880
and uh reapplied either to

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,880
personal forks as far as part of the

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
contribution process to our projects

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,480
or indeed to other projects where

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,720
they're suitable

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,080
i'll draw particular attention to our

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,880
use of docker

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,159
where for the linux platform we've been

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,520
able to

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,559
take the version specifications and

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,240
configurations

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:31,440
which uh the vfx reference platform

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,440
uh defines and actually turn those into

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,919
concrete example recipes which can be

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,600
used directly by our projects and indeed

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,080
any other projects that uh

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,039
choose to draw upon those docker images

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,880
um and we've

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,679
also been able to use you know moving

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,679
head into the future

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:53,520
those uh docker recipes as um

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,559
vfx reference platform configurations

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,799
for the future so

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,320
uh it's been a nice opportunity for us

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,960
to take the prospective

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,960
uh specifications and actually run them

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,279
through with our projects and with other

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,080
parts of the community ahead of their

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,080
formalization

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,200
so moving ahead

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,720
so i gave a quick introduction to the

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,760
python 3 working group

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,200
this has been an effort chaired by

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,799
ashley wetter from dean egg and um has

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,720
been a very nice complement to some of

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,360
the other efforts across the community

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,679
to really understand what it means for

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,000
our process to take this big step ahead

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,960
not only in terms of the way that our

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,480
vendors

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,960
provide their dccs and other software

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,559
but also how we actually go about

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,120
changing

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,159
some of the lower level libraries and of

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,120
course all of our

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,520
internal studio code the foundation is

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,400
as

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,080
provides a very nice space for

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,919
participation across all of these

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,360
different

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,279
units that would otherwise be very much

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,279
separated and not necessarily have

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,760
an obvious forum for communication

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,360
once again i encourage you to check in

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,559
to the slack channel there

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,559
for updates and involvement

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,120
and last but not least for my section

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,360
i'd also like to draw your attention to

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,360
the usd working group

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,000
there is in addition to some of the

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,120
other outcomes there there's

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,840
a very nice

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,000
wiki resource coming together um under

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,120
the umbrella of the foundation

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,159
where many of the

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,360
best practices examples and um

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,640
other information around and beyond the

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,480
core uh usd resources that pixar

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,320
themselves provide

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
is coming together through that working

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,919
group

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,600
and uh there are some really sort of

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,279
interesting extensions happening there

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,960
which i see as great

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,360
examples of the strengths of the

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,760
foundation and its and its efforts

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,640
so uh one thread of activity has been to

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,919
actually

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:10,159
um build live uh

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,080
jupiter notebooks which um allow for uh

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,520
allow for usd examples to be run in

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,480
browser um with

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,600
live python and with even with graphical

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,120
outputs

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,279
that's using the sort of whole stack of

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,039
technologies there the wiki

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,480
and usd running live on top of the aswf

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
docker images which were developed for

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,240
our ci infrastructure

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,279
so it's a neat example those examples

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,799
aren't actually

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,640
live in the wiki yet but if you check in

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,000
on the slack channel you'll be able to

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,360
see the work in progress coming along

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,120
very nicely there

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,120
so that's a perfect hook for us to

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,320
move over to hear about the activities

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,360
of the diversity and working

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,360
the conclusion working group

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,320
hey everyone i'm rachel rose as david

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,840
mentioned at the beginning i am an ilm

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,880
supervisor ilm

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,640
r d supervisor uh and

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,240
more importantly for this presentation

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,679
also a co-chair for the diversity and

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,320
inclusion working group

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,919
so i'm really excited to tell everyone a

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,000
little bit about what we've been doing

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,720
to get this working group started so if

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,080
you could go to the next slide david

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,679
so um back in june the aswf formed the

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,039
diversity inclusion working group now

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,200
this working group is

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,960
very much a collaborative effort to try

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,080
to advance

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,559
diversity inclusion within the open

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
source

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,360
community and in particular the open

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,200
source community for vfx and animation

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,200
this is a obviously a very important

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,279
topic and something that many of us feel

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,640
very strongly about um trying to move

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,559
forward um

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,159
so we're really excited that uh the

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,120
academy software foundation is really

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,080
getting behind this

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,279
and uh trying to make a huge difference

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,200
and now this working group

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,279
is is being formed as a community of

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,880
many different types of people it

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,520
includes people from

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,200
a broad spectrum of different parts of

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,799
the open source community and the vfx

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,360
and animation industries

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,559
um both you know engineers who know open

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,960
source software very well

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,960
as well as others who may not know it

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,360
quite as well but are very interested

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,320
in trying to tackle this specific

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,559
problem

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,080
um we will talk more about this later at

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,840
the end of the presentation but we are

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,240
very very interested in continuing to

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,399
have

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,440
more and more people involved in this

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,039
process

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,399
i think you know one of the main ways

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,320
that you can tackle diversity and

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,559
inclusion is by having a very diverse

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,679
and inclusive group to try to

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,440
drive forward that initiative um so

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,720
we're really excited to have this um

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,399
pulled together now

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,399
so far over the last three months that

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,640
we have been working the primary thing

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,200
that we have been doing is trying to put

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,399
together

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,880
a series of a set of goals that the

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,960
working group can be working towards

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,320
that will take us into the future so

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
these are supposed to be goals that we

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,760
can be

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,080
tar using for a number of years um not

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,960
just

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,640
in the immediate time frame so for uh

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,799
the bulk of the rest of the presentation

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,120
myself and then carol payne my my

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,760
co-chair um we'll be going over the

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,600
three goals that we formed as well as

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,600
um two initiatives under each of the

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,559
goals that we've decided to

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,679
start start with as initial initiatives

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,240
for those goals

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,360
so if we can go to the next slide david

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,919
okay so um

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,799
goal number one is really around student

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,000
education

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,000
uh we we it became very apparent

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,039
through our working group conversations

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
as well as

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,080
a survey that we sent out to our members

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,679
that

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,120
um that being able to uh

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,840
engage young young young young adults in

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,679
particular

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,440
in open source and be able to excite

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,559
them with motion picture and media

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,399
industries

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,679
would be a really great way to start

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,240
bringing in

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,039
a variety of different people into open

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,279
source for

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,279
the effects and animation that might not

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,279
have gotten involved before

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,039
so our first goal really is to encourage

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,320
high school and college students to

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,320
pursue a career in

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,760
or participate in open source projects

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,159
by educating them

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,600
on uses in motion picture and media

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,240
industries

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,919
to start to tackle this goal the first

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,960
two initiatives that we are

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,880
trying to drive forward actively now are

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,640
to first put in place a mentorship

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,000
program that's going to be targeted at

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,279
high school and college-age

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,640
students we'll be looking for partners

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:29,840
at university and colleges in order to

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,000
drive this forward and we we have a

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,399
couple of ideas about how to

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,440
to get this started but we feel like

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,480
this is very

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,399
important mentorship has shown to be a

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,120
great way to

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,760
to increase diversity and is something

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,679
that

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,200
we we hope we can especially with all

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,960
the resources of the academy software

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,200
foundation and all of the amazing

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,760
members we feel like we have a large

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,399
group of people that will be able to be

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,840
actively involved in helping high school

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,960
and college age students learn more

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,880
about open source vfx and animation

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,080
uh the second initiative that we're

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,919
going to try to

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,120
push that we are going to push forward

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,320
for diversity

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,880
um oops if we go back one more sorry

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,679
for the the student education is uh that

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,240
we'd like to

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,000
partner with external organizations that

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,279
promote coding and underrepresented

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,039
populations including open source um and

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,640
inspiring introducing open source to

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,120
these people and inspiring

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,080
through example this is something that

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,960
you know there are a number of

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,720
organizations

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,279
worldwide that have relationships with

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,799
uh underrepresented populations and if

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,399
we can work with those

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,399
organizations and bring our member

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,120
projects to those organizations we think

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,919
that we can

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,440
have a really great effect on diversity

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,880
um i'm now going to go on to

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,279
goal two and pass this off to carol

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,039
who will cover the next two goals

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,960
awesome thanks rachel

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,559
uh yeah like everybody said thanks for

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,240
all the involvement in the chat and

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,080
and hopefully we'll be able to get to as

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,720
many questions as we can but

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,840
until then um the second goal that we

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,799
would like to talk about

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,399
is one that uh so we're talking about

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,080
external goals and educating the

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,000
community at large and students and

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,559
people who want to learn

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,720
it's also really important to look

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,640
internally at the aswf

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,240
um and also by extension the vfx and

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,799
animation communities

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,519
about what it means to be inclusive and

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,039
to be

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,960
diverse and so our second goal is around

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,720
diversity in the academy software

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,200
foundation itself

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,640
looking at the leadership and membership

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,519
across the foundation

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,039
and defining what inclusiveness and

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,320
diversity looks like

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,440
for the aswf so we're going to be

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,399
working

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,440
with our working group members and the

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,000
rest of the

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,600
aswf leadership to define what that

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,919
looks like

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,440
and that's the first goal that bullet

00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,559
point there

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,240
the second one for diversity in aswf is

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,760
really getting a solid connection

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,799
between the working groups

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,120
and our individual member projects and

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,559
so we're thinking about

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,640
how we could accomplish that and that

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,480
looks like an actual uh

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,840
diversity of inclusion ambassador is

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,559
what we're calling them

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,679
that is integrated into each of our

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,640
member projects

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,480
that we talked about before and and is

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,880
really focused on

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,960
working with the projects to help

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,279
achieve our diversity inclusion goals

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,240
um things like inviting and inclusive

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,120
language

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,320
um and then also looking at how easy it

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,840
is to get involved

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,440
in the projects if you're just first

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,480
starting out things like good first

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,679
issues and

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,600
really good documentation and um

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,440
the list goes list goes on and on around

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,080
what we can what we can do

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,519
with uh our diversity inclusion

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,159
ambassador who would also then be

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,559
working

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,240
with our working group to make sure that

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,799
we're staying on track and following the

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,640
goals

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:03,679
and being consistent across the board

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,240
so that's goal number two and the third

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,039
goal

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,679
is a little bit of a mix of both

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,599
internal

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,760
and external and we're calling it

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,119
guidance for members

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,200
and everybody like rachel mentioned is

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,440
is really feeling the importance of this

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,200
work and this time and and for the

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,480
future and for the success of our

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,040
organization

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,520
and there's tons of good resources out

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,560
there

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,599
already on uh inclusion and diversity

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,879
topics

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,320
and and so our third goal is to

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,960
resource those both uh in terms of blog

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,359
posts

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,720
on uh dni topics and those will be

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,119
written at first by

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,560
members of the working group and members

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,000
of the projects and

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,040
sourcing a lot of information that

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,919
already exists within our member base

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,320
but eventually extending that program to

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,639
to

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,000
other people who would like to write and

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,040
have you know

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,839
great information to share in this area

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,440
we already have a blog aswf that emily

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,880
does a great job of running and we're

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,359
looking to

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,520
just grow and expand that and make it a

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,760
real resource for people

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,079
in addition to that we're looking to

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,760
make a real landing page so each project

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,960
has a landing page and a resource

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,800
and things like that we're looking to

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,680
make a similar thing

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,200
for diversity inclusion resources for

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,880
open source software

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,440
building on some of the great tools that

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,079
the linux foundation already has

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,880
it is there for us to utilize and really

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,119
make a space

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,400
for people that are curious and want to

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,320
learn more

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,320
and want to take things back to their

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,040
own organizations own companies own

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,680
schools

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,520
all of these things and you know just

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,320
build on the resources that everybody

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,160
has

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,359
so those are our main three goals that

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,000
we've set up in our

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,359
in our charter and um you know we're

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,520
we're

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,040
really just getting started so we're

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,440
looking for everybody to get

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,560
involved and have an opinion and tell us

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,720
what they think

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,640
if we're going the right direction if

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,480
we're missing anything

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,920
these things are fluid and always

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,920
changing so

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,400
um the last slide that we have for you

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,520
today is how to get involved

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,720
um and there's two real ways

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,040
um we have our mailing list that uh

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,200
is through email or you know online and

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,680
then we have our slack channel which

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,640
tends to be the most active way to get a

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,040
hold of us

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,320
but through the mailing list um you can

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,640
sign up uh

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,560
to receive uh notifications about our

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,079
meetings which happen monthly

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,680
um and we'll be looking to to you know

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,760
change those and adapt those based on

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,240
our member group and we really want to

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,599
be

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,000
um global about this too

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,359
so these meetings right now are you know

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,640
in the middle of the day

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,720
uh us time but obviously if you want to

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
get involved we can you know there's

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,680
lots of different ways we can look

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,760
to do that and increase involvement

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,280
globally for around the world because

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,960
i say we've got a lot of people from

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,160
everywhere on the call today and that's

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,839
really really exciting

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,640
so yeah jump on the slack jump on the

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,240
mailing list talk to rachel or i will be

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,119
happy to answer any and all questions

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,520
you guys have

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,760
and that's it for me thanks everybody

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,119
thank you so much rachel and carol um

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,880
it's an exciting

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,800
initiative to be pushing forward and

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,560
seeing already interest in progress i

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,480
was watching on the chat as people are

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,119
getting interested in getting involved

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,880
this is a way i think as a organization

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,560
outside of any one of our individual

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,400
businesses that are contributing

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,920
we can actually be more powerful

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,200
together than we ever could

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,960
individually right there's nothing

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,320
proprietary about our diversity and

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,680
inclusion initiatives we all want to

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,040
share our best findings

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,040
and we all want more engineers who are

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,400
from a broader variety of backgrounds to

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,599
help us do this work people who are

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,720
passionate about movies

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,200
people who are passionate about

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,680
engineering people may not even realize

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,320
that it's possible to work on these

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,560
projects

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,240
and to contribute to the way movies look

00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,760
by writing software

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,599
and creating pixels behind the scenes

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,640
but all of the movies are affected by

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,000
this so

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,920
any one of your students if you're a

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,599
teacher or if you are a student

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,680
if you have an interest in engineering

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,160
or technical documentation

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,480
or even just testing applications jump

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,079
in on one of these projects take a look

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,760
you might be able to contribute to

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,160
something that is used directly in one

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,560
of these films openexr for example

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,480
is used on pretty much every image made

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,720
in the movie business today

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,640
so we're excited to be here in the

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,079
academy software foundation accelerating

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,520
developments in these areas in fact

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,240
let's just dive into these projects to

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,480
see

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,000
um the kind of progress and the kind of

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,880
acceleration that has happened in this

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,880
last year

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,119
if you look at openddb the very first

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,760
project brought into the academy

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,560
over 3.7 million lines of code change

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,640
that seems

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,320
amazing there is a whole bunch of

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,680
exciting stuff going on in openvp in

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,640
terms of acceleration

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,359
and you can see this is from a group a

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,280
um

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,960
a number of committers not just one

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,160
person not even just a single person

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,160
from a single company

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,320
anymore even though it started all at

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,680
dreamworks so it's very exciting to see

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,160
this kind of progress at openvdb

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,440
the next project is opencolorio and this

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,200
is a really great story because

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,240
opencolorio has been an important part

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,680
of managing color

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,320
in the movie business for the last

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,880
several years but interestingly

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,240
opencolorio had slowed down in its

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,079
development because some of the original

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,599
creators of the project had gone on and

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,599
actually changed industries

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,800
so when it was adopted into the academy

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,040
software foundation

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,880
it was still widely used but it wasn't

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,119
being as actively maintained

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,240
as it is today and you can see how much

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,200
work is going on

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,160
in open color io today the next project

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,079
openq

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,200
has had a long history at sony image

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,359
works

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,960
and uh just came into the foundation

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,720
probably just over a year ago

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,800
and it's actively being worked on as

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,400
well uh heavily from people at google

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,640
but also from other companies

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,560
as well so thank you to those of you who

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,280
are working hard on that project

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,240
and then exr that's uh uh that's the

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,160
image software

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,000
that was created at industrial light

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,720
magic probably

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,839
the most widely adopted uh package of

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,480
everything we're talking about here

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,480
today

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,200
uh term in terms of movies it's used on

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,720
every single movie uh but it also

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,839
had gotten a little bit uh it wasn't it

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,040
wasn't getting the kind of attention

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,319
that it deserved it certainly wasn't

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,880
getting the sort of innovation that it

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,319
needed

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,640
and that's because everybody has a lot

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,319
going on right every day but you can see

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,920
in this last year it's been very

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,400
actively maintained

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,040
it's built into the mac operating system

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,280
in addition to

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,680
many of the linux distributions that are

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,119
out there very very widely used and now

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,839
very actively maintained and there's

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,079
excitement about the future of that as

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,560
well

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,640
open timeline io pixar's first project

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,280
in the academy software foundation

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,640
um very very cool connecting software

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,760
between editorial

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,640
and um and any sort of digital workflows

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,280
in movie production or visual effects

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,200
and

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,440
making a lot of active progress this

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,640
year as well and the last project open

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,160
shading language

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,240
this is a fundamental program

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,760
inside of it's a program that's a

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,359
library that renders use it's a

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,040
programming language for renderers to

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,440
use to describe shading how every

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,960
surface is going to look and very very

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,880
actively developed as you can see

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,319
the lion shares those that development

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,160
work is being done at sony image works

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,599
this was just recently contributed to

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,800
the academy software foundation so that

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,720
makes a lot of sense

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,560
but you can see already contributions

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,200
from intel double negative and other

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,440
companies

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,040
as well and individuals who may not have

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,480
stated an affiliation

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,319
so even though it's only been a short

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,920
amount of time we're seeing some work

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,760
in this open source package and

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,280
accelerating that the academy software

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,920
foundation by just setting out

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,200
clear goals clear ways to contribute and

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,720
hopefully attracting additional

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,920
attention to these projects

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,440
um we're able to accelerate the

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,800
development of these shows

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,720
of these projects rather so

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,920
we saved a bit of time at the end here

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,920
for to hear from you

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,040
and to have some conversation with you

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,960
let's go ahead and start on the first

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,000
poll here david

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,240
to talk about what we are doing well

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,280
where where have we delivered on the

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,680
most value

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,800
in the last couple of years and uh we'll

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,319
also talk about where

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,680
we could deliver more value what we

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,319
could do better or what we should do

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,240
next

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,599
but first let's start with if you just

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,359
go to that url

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,359
at the top there pollyb.com aswf

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,760
and what are some of the things that the

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,240
academy software foundation has done

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,319
well

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,160
and delivered some value that you think

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,000
is helpful and if you're brand new

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,760
it's okay you don't have to participate

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,160
but if you have an opinion on this you

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,480
can

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,760
type in your answers and you can also

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,040
give up votes

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,760
if you see something on there that you

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,839
like you can tap it and it'll help

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,839
raise it to the top of the list

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,359
so i'm already seeing some things coming

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:59,839
up that people are liking

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,839
helping with the legalese indeed

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,640
so uh somebody highlighted automated

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,280
build system and one of the cool things

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,920
about

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,599
the uh build infrastructure that the

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,400
academy software foundation has built

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,040
is it is heavily based or it's based on

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,680
i think

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,680
is it exclusively open source libraries

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,680
almost exclusively as much as we can

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,800
open source libraries and this and the

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,599
infrastructure itself

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,160
is open source so that means you can

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,000
actually

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,760
take this continuous integration

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,760
infrastructure and use leverage it

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,720
internally if you have any interest

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,560
so everything if you are one you or one

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,319
of your engineers is working on it

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,760
that can be both very helpful for the

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,760
academy software foundation but it's

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:55,839
also can be very helpful for your own

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:55,839
business or operation

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,200
it's great to see all these answers

00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,400
coming in it's really fantastic to see

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,200
over 360 people in this meeting

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,560
i noticed we had folks from south africa

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,160
and egypt

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,680
i don't know if you would have been able

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,440
to attend if we were doing this graph in

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,240
person but in a lot of ways i'm

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,680
i'm uh very thrilled with not only just

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,720
the number of people here but

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,319
what a broad range of time zones we

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,720
represent in this room

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,520
um daniel i thought you were the one who

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,359
was

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,200
at the earliest uh but i noticed

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,200
somebody chimed in from adelaide beating

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,400
you by 30 minutes so they had to get up

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,000
30 minutes earlier

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,319
earlier for those but thank you daniel

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,760
and i forgot your name from adelaide

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,319
uh for getting up at either 5 30 or

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,720
5 o'clock this morning to attend this

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,720
session

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,280
yeah it's great to see some of these

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,119
coming up and the academy software

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,560
technical advisory committee the tac

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,520
where a lot of these decisions happen

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,119
and the governing board

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,640
are going to be using this information

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,839
that we get from you back in this

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,400
informal survey

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,280
to help push to help direct some of our

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,400
investments

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,680
going forward we did a meeting last week

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,040
um doing very detailed deep dives on

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,000
each of the projects so people could get

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,000
updated

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,440
and uh a series of meetings last week

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,720
and some of the things that popped up

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,079
there were areas that we were already

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
planning to invest in it was great to

00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,960
see

00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,000
the participation there oh there we go

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,000
three folks from adelaide

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,160
so people appreciate a few things

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,800
highlight before we go on to the next

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,119
one

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,400
um the fact that academy software

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,599
foundation creates a home for all these

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
great open source projects in our

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,800
industry

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,839
i take that to mean both a home and also

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,440
a

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,960
an environment that you can trust that

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,319
will be there for a long time especially

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,599
for some of these core

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,960
libraries and things that we all want to

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,480
be able to rely on for many years into

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,400
the future

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,839
visibility that's great just the pr

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,480
aspect of

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,839
bringing a visibility of engineers and

00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,760
open source projects

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,280
into the industry is fantastic

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,000
democratizing software

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,400
the legalese absolutely supporting

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,640
orphan software absolutely it was a high

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,079
amount it was a high priority when we

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,040
started the foundation to take these

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,240
projects that were incredibly

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,440
fundamental

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,280
to our efforts in and our work that we

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,839
do every day and making sure it had a

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,280
place

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,880
that where work could continue to happen

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,800
vfx reference platform this is a

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,440
fantastic initiative and just to be

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,280
clear

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,280
the visual effects reference platform is

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,520
initiative is an initiative that we

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,359
support uh but it is actually home by

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,920
the visual effects society technology

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,480
committee

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,280
and started over five years ago in that

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,599
committee

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,119
and it is a fantastic platform if you

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,160
want to look it up online you can google

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:47,280
the vfx reference platform

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,520
and every year they advertise what

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,119
versions of key important libraries that

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,880
have a lot of dependencies

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,960
what versions the software providers

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,400
should be using so that the software has

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,119
a better chance of inter

00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,480
interoperability particularly on linux

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,079
but this year the big announcement on

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,359
the vfx reference platform is that

00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,480
they're providing recommendations for

00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,880
linux for mac

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,280
and for windows as well so this is to

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,680
help with the problem of version itis

00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,880
so we're a huge supporter of the vfx

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,640
reference platform

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,880
and we love that initiative and um

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,359
they're doing a fantastic job with it

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,359
for sure

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,040
and then down just a little further is

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,480
automated build systems and and

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,200
providing these common spaces and

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,559
getting

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,319
us talking with each other which is

00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,440
fantastic and if you're interested in

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,440
participating

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,960
as daniel mentioned the tac meetings

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,119
which are

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,960
every other week is that right daniel i

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,280
said something fancy

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,319
fortnightly that's right yeah what what

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,680
for those of us

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,440
who aren't smart enough to understand

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,800
fortnightly it's every other week

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,040
that's right okay cool they're

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,319
weekly twice weekly all of these things

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,599
are confusing in their own way

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,880
they are exactly but every 14 days or so

00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,280
depending on whether the mood no just

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,359
kidding um yes every 14 days attack

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,880
meets and that is an open meeting anyone

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,319
can is welcome to attend um and just a

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,000
couple other things

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,599
we always say this but the academy

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,520
software foundation we

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,880
provide software with permissive open

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,359
source software licenses that means

00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,319
everyone can use it it's free to use

00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,680
you can check out the individual

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,839
licenses but we try to make them as

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,960
simple and as clear and as permissive

00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,599
as possible so whether you are a member

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,720
or not

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,079
you can use a software you can

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,599
contribute to the software you can

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,280
attend the tac meetings all the

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,240
important decisions happen you can

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,040
you can chime in on all that as a member

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,800
your company is

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,160
supporting this initiative which i think

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,680
is a great investment

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,160
certainly for the companies that i've

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,359
talked to a small amount of financial

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,319
donation and

00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,680
a full-time engineer which is somebody

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,480
you assigned to the projects you want

00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,400
them to work on

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,520
that's a modest investment compared to

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,640
the investments

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,920
all of our companies are making

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,800
individually to try to make some of this

00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,160
stuff happen

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,520
so this has been a fantastic

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,960
collaborative effort we've seen in the

00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,280
industry

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,000
so we'll go on to the next slide things

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,920
uh that we

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,440
can do to create more value or

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,760
um let me see what actually wrote on

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,839
there uh yeah how can we oh there you go

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,920
i i wrote exactly what i said

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,760
how can the academy software foundation

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,240
create more value either for you

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,839
or your organization what would be the

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:31,599
kind of things we can do next

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:36,400
that would create more value for you

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,400
it requires deep thinking yeah exactly

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,200
so jonathan might have taken the prize

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,839
for the earliest

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,839
start this morning from perth

00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,800
this is great finding more standards to

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,520
adopt is already coming up

00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,520
towards the top

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,839
so um vfx reference platform docker

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,280
builds

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,319
daniel do you just want to talk about

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,000
that for a minute because it came up

00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,760
both on a place we were creating value

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,319
and a place we could create more value

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,760
if we made an automatic rpm so can

00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,200
where can people go who are interested

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,440
in that topic and is it worth giving a

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:26,000
brief update on that

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:27,920
so uh we

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,599
let's see so the slack channel that i

00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,559
mentioned is probably the first port of

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,280
call to

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,880
uh engage with the people who are

00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,920
actively working on the

00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,319
docker images and uh checking

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,359
into the ci working group generally

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,720
looking at the past

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:47,359
notes which are on the swf

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,880
github are a good way also just sort of

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:54,160
seeing the broader context of that work

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,040
that comment sort of suggests

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,640
that there's already a bit of

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,880
familiarity with the work and an

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:03,119
interest in being able to take those

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,720
uh docker images from um

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,319
the setting which they currently use

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,280
which which allows them to be very

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,000
easily sort of picked up

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,280
and used for uh for ci and for things

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,280
like the jupiter notebooks

00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,040
and actually allow them to be used in a

00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,200
production environment

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,559
there are a few additional steps there

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,160
of course

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:25,920
docker containers are a

00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,480
still have some um friction or some uh

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,319
teething issues usually with uh hardware

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,079
accelerated graphics and other things

00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:35,040
so there's a couple of steps there in

00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,480
order to make them really effective as

00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,200
you know as the platform that you build

00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,680
your uh production workstations on and

00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,680
so on

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,280
but that's certainly an area that um

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,960
we're interested in and

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:50,400
as we look to uh windows and mac

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,240
where uh docker unfortunately isn't um

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,760
as well supported and as capable as it

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,119
is on the linux platform

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,960
um we are uh extending to looking at

00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,119
general package managers as

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,040
a way of uh supporting those platforms

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,200
as the vfx first from platform

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,400
rev sorry excuse me reference platform

00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,359
extends onto the

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,319
uh to the other uh platforms we're doing

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,319
the same with our

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,559
uh ci infrastructure and for our

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:18,079
projects uh and that will naturally

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,760
uh include using a a broader set of

00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,400
package management approaches

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,960
and i expect that that in fact might be

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,000
the part

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,440
we take to runtime

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,839
install uh packages for even for linux

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,599
as well

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,359
so stay tuned that's definitely uh

00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,880
that's definitely in scope

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,200
not only for linux but also for our

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,559
other platforms

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,559
great so the top two topics are

00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,079
um not surprisingly about adding more

00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,920
projects and this is something that

00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,480
we're very interested in continuing to

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,240
do um open image i o is a great example

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,720
usd is another great example it became

00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,960
the

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,000
first and the second item on the list

00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,960
but just to

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,160
as a primer for those of you who haven't

00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,520
already attended some of these other

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,119
meetings the way we

00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,280
adopt projects is um by reaching out to

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,240
the hosting organization in usd's case

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,000
it's pixar

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,599
ex and and seeing if they have any

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,359
interest in

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,200
in the academy software foundation

00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,400
backing the project or adopting the

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,880
project and then they would be the ones

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,119
who would sign that over

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,640
so we've continued to have great

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,000
conversations with our friends at pixar

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,280
they have a project already in the

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,079
academy software foundation and

00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,119
certainly

00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,800
by being a responsible host for that

00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,880
project and hopefully it continuing to

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,240
accelerate its development and adoption

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,319
that'll be a great sign for them to

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,359
consider such a large project

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,880
like usd um usd is in addition to being

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,079
a huge open source project it's also a

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,559
fundamental

00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,160
tool in their own pipeline over at pixar

00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,440
so you can imagine it's a big decision

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,960
whether to sign over

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,640
uh the management of that over to the

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,680
academy software foundation

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,680
um but if there's a specific reason i'm

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,520
uh i'm really interested in learning

00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,800
more you could chat on the slack or on

00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,839
the mailing list if there's a specific

00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,520
thing that you think the academy

00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,920
software foundation can do

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,359
to help uh you could join the working

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,200
group

00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,960
that is already formed in order to

00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,960
support usd because whether usd

00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,160
is in the academy software in the

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,400
academy software foundation

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,920
or not we're interested in supporting it

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,280
supporting its successful development

00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,079
and adoption and it's already an open

00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,599
source package

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,079
with a very permissive license very

00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,240
consistent with all our views

00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,599
and we would love to continue to support

00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,720
it as much as we can

00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:29,280
so um yeah so that is the current status

00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,440
on that for sure

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,040
and i love seeing more tutorials and

00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,960
adoption on the use of the software this

00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,680
is a better onboarding which is an area

00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,960
that

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,240
we haven't really focused on yet and i

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,400
think it would be really good

00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,000
for us to look at that in the next year

00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,319
as we go from the state of kind of

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,359
getting the software in a good shape for

00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,920
the expert users

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:52,160
to users who might be newer to these

00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,760
packages because they're very um they

00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,280
require a lot of expertise

00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,559
right now for sure to integrate into

00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,839
your own projects so that's a really

00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,520
good idea

00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:01,040
and that that would also be an excellent

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,599
point of engagement for

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,280
people who would like to contribute

00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,000
their skills and their understanding of

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,559
the system so that it expands the pool

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,640
from

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,079
perhaps sort of hardcore developers to

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,119
other people who have built the

00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,200
experience of use

00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,280
and of application we'd really encourage

00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,400
them to be involved to start to help us

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,599
build

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,079
those onboarding materials

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,760
and the next one we particularly love uh

00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,319
successfully convince more companies to

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,280
join

00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,559
pay up and donate time absolutely and

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,280
you can

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,079
uh engineers and companies can work on

00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,440
academy software

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,119
foundation projects with or without

00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,079
being a member but we love having them

00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,280
as members

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,119
as a member they get a seat on the

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,640
governing board they get to help direct

00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,599
the spending of the academy software

00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,280
foundation

00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,880
uh which do things like support these

00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,400
dni initiatives

00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,960
support the project support days like

00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,079
this uh to actually happen

00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,359
um and we do have a uh as david

00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,920
highlighted about a million dollar

00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,280
budget

00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,200
actually just over a million dollar

00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,720
budget um assuming all the companies

00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,119
continue to re-up and participate which

00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,040
they have which has been fantastic

00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,200
we could imagine doing more with more

00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,559
participation absolutely and if you are

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,799
representing a company or an

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,160
organization who might be interested in

00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,319
a general membership

00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,440
or a premier membership the premier

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,280
membership is

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,280
uh is a look is more expensive and

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,839
provides that greater level of support

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,640
and the general membership is quite cost

00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,880
effective

00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,799
uh to be deeply involved in the academy

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,799
we and you saw the slide with our

00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,000
supporting companies who were incredibly

00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,599
grateful for

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
um but if you have any questions about

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:37,200
membership or how you could support

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,559
the organization as a the the academy

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,920
software foundation as the organization

00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,000
that you work with

00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,440
you could reach out to david marin or i

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,160
anytime we'd be happy

00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,240
to speak with you about that we have a

00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,200
question in the chat

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,400
about is there a non-corporate

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,079
membership

00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,240
so we have three categories of

00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,079
memberships a premier

00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,440
that gives you a seat on the board

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,119
general membership and

00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,720
associate membership for the non-profits

00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:09,520
and other companies that or organization

00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,599
that can join the foundation at very

00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,319
little or no cost

00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,000
so that we can participate in in the

00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,760
movement

00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,440
but we do not have an individual

00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,440
membership at this time

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,200
um beyond those three that david just

00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,400
highlighted

00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,839
right great and pre-compiled binaries

00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,440
from multiple platforms daniel is it

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,960
correct today that most of our projects

00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,599
only have pre-compiled binaries for the

00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,520
linux

00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,720
environment uh so it'd be quick to say

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,040
that we don't really

00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,240
offer distributable binaries for any

00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,400
platform um

00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,720
that's that again falls into that

00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,400
category of uh the package manager

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,319
uh space that i referred to earlier and

00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,599
uh that's something that uh docker

00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,480
images start to

00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,359
take us along the way to but really in

00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,319
order to mesh

00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:59,520
with um the normal sort of production

00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,280
runtime environments

00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,760
uh in a useful way we need to look

00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,319
beyond docker to other package managers

00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,319
make sense

00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,680
great well if there are um well you know

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,440
what i think i've got do i have a couple

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,079
more slides in here or do i

00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,760
to wrap it up i think i might oh yeah we

00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,000
we've been doing it we've been doing the

00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,280
q a interactively with this poll so we

00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,920
can go ahead and leave this poll

00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,359
up and i think we fielded a lot of the

00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,720
questions that came in the chat but if

00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,839
we missed something go ahead and drop it

00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,960
in the chat now

00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:33,280
we have only four minutes before our

00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,720
academy software foundation open source

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,799
project birds of a feather

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,000
which starts in what four minutes at two

00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,839
o'clock so

00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,760
um we definitely recommend you all are

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,960
going to want to attend that

00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,520
this is really about the overall

00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,440
structure of the foundation um a

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,880
very light on the details of what's

00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,400
happening on each project i gotta say

00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,599
the projects are very exciting

00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,680
there's really good updates that you're

00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,079

so we will look forward to seeing you in

00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,359
