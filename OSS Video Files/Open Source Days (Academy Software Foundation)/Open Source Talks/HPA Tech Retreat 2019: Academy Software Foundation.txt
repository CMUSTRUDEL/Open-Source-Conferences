	Academy Software Foundation: 
Enabling Cross-Industry Collaboration for Open Source Projects

In August 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and The Linux Foundation launched the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) to provide a neutral forum for open source software developers in the motion picture and broader media industries to share resources and collaborate on technologies for image creation, visual effects, animation and sound. This presentation will explain why the Foundation was formed and how it plans to increase the quality and quantity of open source contributions by lowering the barrier to entry for developing and using open source software across the industry.

[Music]

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,920
you

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:17,340
if fists won't want to hello everyone

00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:20,189
how are you excited you are the the

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,829
troopers the last presentation of the

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,869
one before last the the true survivors

00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,329
of HPA thank you for being here

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,520
and I'm very happy to be here with you

00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,130
to present the Academy Software

00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,800
Foundation to you so in the next 20

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:40,260
minutes I'm going to give you a brief

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,780
overview of how this came to be why it

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,480
exists the foundation and what we intend

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,120
to do my name is David Moran I'm the

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,499
executive director of the foundation the

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,989
Academy Software Foundation is about

00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:58,769
open source software in the motion

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,140
picture industry so by way of

00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,390
introduction we're going to unpack those

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,700
two lines starting with open source

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,340
software so we all know what open source

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,550
software is but it's always good to look

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,079
at at the basic definition of it so that

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,729
we're all at the same level and a

00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,700
program whose source code is made

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,310
available for use or modification as

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,750
users or other developers see fit it's

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,219
usually developed as a public

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,280
collaboration and made freely available

00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,259
that's the kind of general definition

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,450
that everyone knows about with open

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,860
source those who are really doing open

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,409
source know that it's a little bit more

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,810
complicated than that open source

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,310
software this is a type of computer

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,740
software in which source code is

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,140
released under a license so even though

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,649
it's free there's still a license

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,880
there's still illegal requirements

00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:50,520
related to the use of open source

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,350
software where the copyright holder

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,329
meaning there's someone that owns the

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,509
copyright of this open source project

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,000
grants users the right to study change

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,310
and distribute the software that's an

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,039
that's an important definition these

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,460
details play an important role in how

00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:13,260
easy or how hard it is to work with open

00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:16,170
source software in any industry a quick

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,390
trends so open source software is an

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,040
existence since a long times as long as

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,850
software existed there was this idea

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,150
that software should be free

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,860
in a certain portion of the industry but

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,900
it really took off with the web-scale

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,410
companies the Google Facebook Twitter

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,870
Netflix they used open-source as a mean

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:38,350
to an end and they open sourced a vast

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,450
quantity of software the goal being to

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,980
put their development out there so

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,600
others can contribute so that the

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,760
community can come in so that what

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,020
they're doing is transparent multiple

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,790
benefits traditional companies

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,310
commercial software vendors that used to

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,390
be closed source protecting software

00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,670
with licenses and and very very

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,130
bulletproof licensing are also now doing

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:06,220
open source Autodesk is one we've heard

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,710
about them they're here today Comcast

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,800
Intel Salesforce Samsung about every

00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,220
company that used to sell software under

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:19,620
the behind the closed wall is now have

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:22,930
open source projects of various size and

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,170
startups have been contributing now to

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,970
open source most startup out there start

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,400
their software stack with a component

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,410
that's open source to try to entice the

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,380
community to grow a community of

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,660
developers around what they do all that

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,250
contributes to the growth of open source

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,310
software in general this is a projection

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,860
by the Linux Foundation that shows the

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,300
number of libraries that are set to

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,850
skyrocket also something that you

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:55,480
probably noticed last year there was two

00:03:51,850 --> 00:04:00,670
big open source related acquisition the

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:05,590
acquisition of github by Microsoft right

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:08,170
and the acquisition of Red Hat by IBM

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,270
the acquisition of Red Hat by IBM Red

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,340
Hat a open source a company that has

00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,250
developed a business around open source

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,239
software sold for 32 billion to to IBM

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,340
and that's a sign that the open source

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:26,970
ecosystem is playing an ever bigger role

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:30,760
in technology in our lives out there now

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:34,030
in the motion picture industry if we go

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,529
back from this very high level vision

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,359
and we go to

00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:40,149
but we're doing in the motion picture

00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:44,099
industry so this we all know that chart

00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:47,829
the all-time worldwide box-office top 40

00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:49,599
familiar names all around when you look

00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:57,249
at that list from the point of view of

00:04:49,599 --> 00:05:00,189
software yep what do we see we see that

00:04:57,249 --> 00:05:01,929
every one of those movies has been made

00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:04,749
with software every one of those movies

00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:07,119
is either an animation movie entirely

00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:09,809
done and rendered by artist but using

00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:13,509
software or is a visual effects movie

00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:15,939
that could not have existed without the

00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:19,719
visual effects that were also done with

00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:23,289
software the list actually goes down to

00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:26,289
number 133 before you find a live-action

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:29,199
movie a normal live action movie which

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:31,299
is Mamma Mia which did seven hundred

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,579
million dollars which is a good number

00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:35,919
but it's about the first one that is

00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:40,779
really there was no visual effects in

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:43,779
the movie no no animation so software

00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:47,439
plays an immense role in these movies

00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:49,809
that people go see right so in this day

00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,449
and age today with so many different

00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:54,399
choices for entertainment from

00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:57,459
television to videogames to the rest of

00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,019
it we still have movies billion dollar

00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:00,879
movie equipment is still in theater

00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:04,209
they're made a billion dollars so people

00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,029
you know take their put their coats on

00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:10,359
get in their car go to the theater see a

00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:12,609
movie take a big chunk of time they go

00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:15,189
do that it's a real market it's a

00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:17,979
growing market 42 billion dollar last

00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:21,609
year growth of 2% in the theatrical

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:23,889
feature and of course this is just one

00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:25,989
part of the revenue that these products

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,019
generate the box office we like to talk

00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:30,849
about it but movies make money in many

00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:33,069
many other ways so these are the

00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:36,479
products of our time in the world of

00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:40,239
film and they're all based on software

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,819
so two years ago two years and a half

00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:46,419
ago now the Academy of Motion Picture

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:49,389
Arts and Science under the direction of

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:52,719
Rob Reider the CTO of Lucasfilm

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:55,270
Rob proposed to start an investigation

00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:57,849
on the use of open source software in

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,819
the motion picture industry and that was

00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:02,919
out of a hunch that Rob had that open

00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,110
source software plays a very important

00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,840
role and there's there was plenty of

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,460
evidence of that already with all sorts

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,789
of libraries that have become standard

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,759
to our industry but there was a sense

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,710
also that our open source community in

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,979
our open source libraries were a little

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:24,060
bit stuck they had difficulties scaling

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:27,189
there was some problems and leveraging

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,599
software and having the community work

00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:33,370
with each other it was a bit of a

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:36,580
underground development economy if you

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,029
want people engineers we're doing open

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,729
source projects sometimes with the

00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:44,800
knowledge of their company sometimes not

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,719
just because they thought that it was

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,000
important and often they were right

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:51,729
there's libraries like open Colorado

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,650
openexr open VDB that became fundamental

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,969
and used and about every visual effects

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,449
and animation movies that are out there

00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:00,430
that we're languishing so over a period

00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,919
of two years and about four different

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,990
meetings this group of people CTOs of

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,900
animation and visual effects movies and

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,569
others and in the film industry gathered

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,639
around the table at the academy and at

00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:15,849
this is the agenda for the last meeting

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:20,889
where at the end of it it was proposed

00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:23,169
to create a foundation to help open

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:26,740
source software in the motion picture

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:28,990
industry in collaboration with the Linux

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,629
Foundation and it was proposed that

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,320
candidate test project to be openexr

00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:39,820
open color i/o and open VDB that was a

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:43,360
year ago February 12 2008 een six months

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,199
later we created the Academy Software

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,519
Foundation a joint partnership between

00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:51,760
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &

00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,949
Science and the Linux Foundation the

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,699
founding members as you've seen here

00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:59,560
we'll hear more about them came in put a

00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:02,769
little bit of money and I will describe

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,540
how the mechanics work so that we can

00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,100
give a shot in their arm to our

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,259
open-source software development

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:15,189
community do you've read this you've

00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:17,350
read this into the program the the goal

00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:19,540
is to provide a neutral forum for open

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,549
source software developer in the motion

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,929
picture and broader media industry to

00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:27,369
share resource and collaborate on

00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:29,499
technology we have a video we just

00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:31,540
released for the SciTech Awards where

00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:33,759
our chairman Robredo

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,369
chairman of the board of the Academy

00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:42,699
Software Foundation talks about what we

00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:45,399
intend to do creative filmmakers today

00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:48,489
rely more than ever on engineers and

00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,329
scientists using open source software to

00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:53,379
help craft fantastic visionary images

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:55,629
every single part of the filmmaking

00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,239
process is touched by software and a lot

00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,799
about software is open source software

00:09:57,239 --> 00:10:02,529
some of the greatest innovations we've

00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,569
seen in the modern era of filmmaking

00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:06,850
have actually been supported by open

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:09,490
source software the Academy of Motion

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,009
Picture Arts and Sciences and the Linux

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,709
Foundation have created the academy

00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,959
software foundation with support from

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,269
industry leaders the Academy soccer

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,329
foundation exists to provide a great

00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:24,850
home for open source projects that we as

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:26,410
an industry use every day to projects

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,809
the Academy Software Foundation is

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:33,490
currently working on our open BBB and

00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:35,619
open color AIA open BBB is a volumetric

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,170
data block format it is pretty

00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:40,269
ubiquitous in use anytime we have an

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,309
explosion its BTB anytime you have

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:44,799
clouds it's bdb anywhere where you have

00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:47,139
a lot of fluid simulation fireballs gas

00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,629
flowing across surface things that are

00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:52,209
big we think there's value in having an

00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:54,189
organization outside of DreamWorks take

00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,450
responsibility for this and I think

00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:58,910
we've already seen a benefit and that

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,410
had other studios step forward in a way

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,260
they had not previously with

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,580
contributions to the standard open Clara

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,070
is an open source color management

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,010
solution for motion picture production

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,140
and and everyone working on a show from

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,640
an artist at a workstation to a director

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,130
in a theater you can see the same image

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,050
and speak the same visual language open

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,520
Clara is compatible with theses and can

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,890
be used to implement any well-defined

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,720
color standard highly critical projects

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,130
need oversight particularly for more

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,170
than one studio or company and can

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,210
benefit greatly from not only shared

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,220
development resources but also the solid

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,750
infrastructure offered by the Linux

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,090
Foundation and their involvement academy

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,100
Software Foundation whether you are a

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,870
user of open source software or an

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,370
engineer or a company that relies on

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,380
open source software we want to create

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,670
the right ecosystem for you to get the

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,880
most out of the open source software

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,940
that you need to use find it set a SWF

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:56,690
dot IO and join the mailing list and see

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:59,360
how you can get involved so if my

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:02,930
presentation was to end up here that's

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,930
what you need to do go to a SWF dot IO

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,480
and find out more about what we're doing

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,910
and how you can join with a little bit

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,520
of time that that is left I'm going to

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,920
continue dig a little deeper into how

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,730
we're doing things our members actually

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,290
we have a new member Nvidia just joined

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,850
just after we made that video so their

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,600
logo is right here with us

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,700
we have three class of members premiere

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,740
members these are the companies the

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,860
organization that really care about this

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,560
this cause and they're investing a bit

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,680
of money and they're committing one

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,050
full-time engineer equivalent a year to

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,970
the projects of the foundation so as we

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:49,730
have 12 premiere members we now have 12

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,890
full-time engineer equivalents ready to

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,570
dig in and work on our projects that's

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,310
one of the benefits that the foundation

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,880
is bringing to the projects that will be

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,170
in it general members are there at the

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,980
lesser level of commitment but they're

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,500
still in in the map and the associate

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,140
members are other nonprofit organization

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,080
or open-source projects that want to

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,080
join

00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,540
foundation you want to find out more

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,310
about how to join your company is not if

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,950
your company is not on that list of

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:24,030
companies you should consider joining

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:25,830
the Academy Software Foundation as as a

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,870
cause it's a foundation it's a

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,090
non-profit it's like when you when you

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,340
join a non-profit on the cause that you

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,980
care about if you care about open source

00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,810
software think about joining all the

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,240
details on how to do that how much it

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:42,660
cost the process is all detailed on our

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,780
website but more than companies and

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,820
logos this is about the people and you

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,290
can also find out the people that are

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,480
involved each company has a

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,030
representative on our governing board

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,100
each company also has a technical

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,680
representative on our technical advisory

00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,490
council which is the core of the

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,640
foundation the foundation is there to to

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,550
energize and empower the engineers is

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,670
for the software engineers that do open

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,410
source software there is a side mission

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,940
that we have to shine a light on the

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,330
work of software engineers in our

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,740
industry because unlike other industries

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,630
Silicon Valley is where the software

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,460
engineer is the king of the hill here

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,450
the artist is the king of the hill and

00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,700
that's the way it should be the

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,710
filmmaker the people who do the imagery

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,420
and the software engineers are there to

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,850
their service but they're doing amazing

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,370
work and they've been in the shadow a

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,580
lot in some ways we've been losing some

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,320
of our engineers to Silicon Valley for a

00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,000
number of reasons we want to make sure

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,430
that those who are passionate about it

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,140
our industry stay with us and are

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,000
encouraged to stay with us and we can

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,600
grow our software base and motion

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,850
picture so the people are important so

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,730
our mission you've seen it I'll go over

00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:01,890
that quickly increase the quality and

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:05,760
quantity of open-source contribution you

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:07,740
can read it our goals quickly so we're

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,690
providing a neutral forum it's been

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,080
alluded to in the video when an

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,900
open-source library is at a company at a

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,330
studio sometimes not always but

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,850
sometimes other studios have a citation

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,800
to contribute to their competitor

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,310
essentially even though these libraries

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,560
are

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,930
for the benefit of all so by having a

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,210
neutral problem in a neutral entity like

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,190
the foundation we're providing that that

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:36,300
that water hole where we can all come

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:38,279
and put our our competitive hats at the

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,040
door and work on the software that is

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,450
good for everybody we're developing a

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,220
continuous integration and build

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,260
infrastructure this is very important to

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,750
build open source software you need a

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,240
build infrastructure every companies who

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,589
take an open source software and does

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,570
something with it has a bill

00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:57,360
infrastructure all of those are

00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,040
different than they're hidden in the

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,710
engineering department of every company

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,589
at the foundation we have and we are

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,450
taking in an open source build

00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,890
infrastructure we're bringing it over

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,650
from our partner the Linux Foundation

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,210
who already has that running for many

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:15,630
other projects that they're doing and

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,490
we're going to port our projects over or

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,830
bring our projects over that build

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,050
infrastructure for everyone to see what

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,610
that means is that smaller studios who

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,980
may not have the engineering to develop

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,440
their own build infrastructure custom or

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,050
find that down thing could actually take

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,330
and copy the build infrastructure of the

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,700
académie Software Foundation and use it

00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:39,660
as is or parts of it or bits of it as

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,730
they want it's open source we want to

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,620
streamline the development and so not

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,810
only the infrastructure but the build

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,940
configuration the script the recipes all

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:51,360
of that is going to be available to the

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,160
community we want to provide individual

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
individuals an organization a clear path

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,839
for participation and cold contribution

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,490
so it's explained on our website you

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,050
want to contribute all of our mailing

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,030
lists are open they're all there for

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,100
every project for everyone to see you

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,260
can you can see all the discussions that

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,850
are going on we have members of our

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,069
founding companies that are leading the

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:14,220
charge but all our proceedings are open

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:18,240
source and the way to join is very clear

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:20,420
and simple and we won't last but not

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,400
least provide a better more consistent

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,709
licensing through a shared licensing

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,439
template if you have dealt with open

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,330
source libraries in your companies you

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,130
know that the legal department has

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,570
something to say about that and

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,880
depending on your legal department

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,840
sometimes you have you have legal

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,210
professionals who are

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,240
very familiar with IP and software

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:45,539
sometime not they come from other places

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,789
of they're in their own industry and it

00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:49,559
takes a while to educate them on why are

00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:51,659
we doing open-source why are we sharing

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,789
our secrets with everyone these kind of

00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:55,500
things now the Academy Software

00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:57,450
Foundation provides a place where you

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,260
put an effort on that and if you're

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,900
legal folks look at our license

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,360
templates and approve them they do that

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,850
once and after that all the projects can

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,940
go the byte bar it so the structure of

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,860
the foundation is like this the board of

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,990
director on top is there to provide
