hi everyone for you do you like the

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:13,070
movies can I hear yes so it's great to

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,770
be here from the motion picture business

00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:20,010
to talk about the Academy Software

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,279
Foundation and we're we're the new kid

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,990
in the in the world of the Linux

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,609
Foundation about the different projects

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,250
that are out there

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,949
we just got created three weeks ago we

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,469
announced here at SIGGRAPH in this

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,600
convention center three weeks ago and

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,920
we're in the process of setting this up

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,660
what I want to do in the next ten

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,790
minutes is to give you kind of an or an

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,050
overview of where we came from which is

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,910
a story that you'll be very familiar

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,950
with I think from the other industries

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,020
but there's a bit of a flavor that is

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,930
specific to to us to the motion picture

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,469
business and go a little bit quickly and

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,879
to where we're at in setting this up and

00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:59,550
the specifics of how we're setting up

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,090
the foundation so but first I want to

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,280
talk about the movies generally so what

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,400
you have on screen right now is the top

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,070
20 movies of all time by box-office

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,850
revenue the motion picture business in

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,250
theatrical box office makes about 40

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,680
billion dollar-a-year were worldwide

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,869
these are just for the tickets that you

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,420
buy when you go to the movies here in

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,420
China and anywhere on earth the movie

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,329
motion pictures generate a lot of

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,540
revenues in other in other ways from

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,130
video streaming theme park toys and all

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,500
kinds of things this is just the tip of

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,869
a pyramid but what's interesting to note

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,869
when you look at this list of movies is

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,710
that they are all either visual effects

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,860
movies or animation movies and they are

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,290
all essentially by and large

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,079
computer-generated and done with

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,850
software with artists using software and

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:03,390
you have to go down the list to number

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:06,840
138 most profitable movies of all time

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,629
to get to a pure live-action movie but

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,790
the movie is mama mia it did six hundred

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,420
and fifty million dollars but all the

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,310
movies that

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,050
up there before then have been done

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,739
essentially with software computer

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,650
graphic software and the engineers that

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,599
work on that

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,290
use open source they've been using open

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,720
source as the other industries have and

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,700
as has become a an important part of

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,970
movie production since the beginning

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,640
there's a list of all the libraries that

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,620
are used for open source and these are

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,450
some of them they probably never heard

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,790
about them but they're very instrumental

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,180
in the making of the movies ASIS and

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,640
then big open Carla Rio openexr

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,100
two years ago as Jim alluded to we

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,709
started an investigation at the Academy

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,290
Robredo from Lucasfilm I had this

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,360
understanding that perhaps the Academy

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,569
could do something to help the open

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,180
source community and so the the

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,910
investigation went on for two years

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,470
there was a lot of the CTOs and the

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,540
director of technologies that are

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,269
involved in moviemaking in animation

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,329
studios and VFX studios visual effects

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,970
that got together around the same table

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,390
started discussing about software and

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,519
how we can improve the development of

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,410
open source at the beginning we really

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,579
thought that well you know open source

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,900
is what it is it's kind of a grassroot

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:38,250
motivated and there's not much we can do

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:42,060
to help that but as we proceeded at some

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,950
point when we invited Jim and Mike Dolan

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,280
from the Linux Foundation to come and

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,370
the first witness what we were doing and

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,820
very quickly they said gently this as

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,540
well maybe there are ways that we can we

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,579
can help with this and they started

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,799
telling us how we could fix some of

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:05,489
these problems that you see on screen

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,470
right now so the Academy Software

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,510
Foundation was created it's a

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,030
collaboration between the next

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,799
Foundation and the Academy the goal is

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,359
to provide a neutral forum for open

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,479
source software in the motion picture

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:21,419
business and also the broader media

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,849
industries and too for that platform to

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,650
allow for collaboration on the creation

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:28,470
of images

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,110
visual effects animation and sound we

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,970
have members this this project this

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,949
foundation is set up like many of the

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,889
other Linux Foundation projects these

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,530
are our founding members so you

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,680
recognize the names there while Disney

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,350
studio in particular is is where Pixar

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,669
is and Lucasfilm is and this the

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:55,500
animation is you have a blue sky which

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:58,080
is part of Fox Studios you have VFX

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,810
vendors DreamWorks is part of NBC

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,789
Universal you have wet a digital a

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,860
visual effects vendor who is famous for

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:07,620
the Planet of the Apes movies you have

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,860
animal logic in Australia who's famous

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,590
for the Lego movies you have double

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,960
negative in London and that is famous

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,300
for the James Bond movies and a lot of

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,180
live-action work done in in London and

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:26,160
and then our technology partner Google

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,870
Intel epic games and we together created

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,270
the first phase of this foundation

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:35,430
foundry side effects also general

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,470
members on the software side this is a

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,280
slide about our lunch tree with three

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,710
weeks ago and also Nargis tent and you

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,849
see on this image Robredo doing a

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:51,000
keynote in this room actually about the

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,800
creativity in motion picture Rob was the

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,050
visual effects supervisor of the latest

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,370
Star War movies the solo movie and he

00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,500
presented about the process of

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,039
creativity and he announced the

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,900
foundation as part of his keynote and we

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,270
had a good deal of press from our own

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,010
trade press within the motion picture

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:12,330
business and also from the technology

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:14,880
press out there and the mission for the

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,320
foundation is simple increase the cut

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,110
the quality quantity of open-source

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,240
contribution by establishing treating

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,639
the governor's model a legal framework

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,020
and the community infrastructure we want

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,720
to lower the barriers of entry for

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,630
developing and using open-source in our

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,659
industry there's a lot of things we're

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,800
doing that you you are already doing if

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,949
you're working within amateur

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,629
Linux foundation projects this is all

00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,020
familiar to you and probably old news

00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:46,270
but it's new to us thank you for

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,300
indulging us so our goals are to connect

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,099
to coordinate across projects to develop

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,039
a continuous integration and build

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:55,180
infrastructure that is open to all so

00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,979
that we can streamline the development

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,889
of build and runtime environments

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:02,440
provide better more consistent licensing

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,509
template on the legal side and provide a

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,449
clear path for participation and code

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:10,060
contribution in our industry so

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:12,789
essentially we want to bring the

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,430
engineers who are working hard and in

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:18,099
the case of open source libraries and

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,440
initiatives often the engineers have

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,509
seen a problem that needed to be solved

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,610
was not mandated by anyone

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,889
they took initiatives and they they

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,840
wrote the code that was needed they open

00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,360
sourced it for everyone to share that

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,419
process in the motion picture business

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,550
has been in the shadows a little bit and

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,139
we want to the foundation was to shine

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,150
the light of the work of the engineers

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:47,229
and bring them resources and structure

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:49,030
the governance so our foundation is a

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,029
non-profit it's under the Linux

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:55,800
Foundation so it's outside of any

00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:59,289
particular studio or company's firewall

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,610
it's there's a governing board as you

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:05,110
would expect and there is a technical

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,680
project group a technical advisory

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,750
council that is independent from the

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,840
governing board to ensure that the

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,449
engineers in this organization continue

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,430
to make the decisions about the project

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:23,080
so it's sort of a division between

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:25,029
church and state at the this is the

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,610
graph you've seen a version of this many

00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:30,669
time the governing board the Technical

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,770
Advisory Council and the projects and so

00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,750
the TAC role is to establish the best

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,149
practice identify the resource

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,039
coordinate with the community propose

00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,649
the new project and we're in that phase

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,979
right now the our foundation is new so

00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:47,310
we have a number of

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,980
target projects but none of them are in

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,870
we are an empty vessel three weeks into

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,260
it so now the process is a lot about

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,990
bringing the projects in and the tack is

00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,940
doing that also being formed as we speak

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:04,139
and the projects will sit on this

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,320
continuous integration infrastructure

00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:10,769
that comes to us from the Linux

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,420
Foundation we've already tested some of

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:14,880
the open source libraries that you've

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,920
seen before on the continuous

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,810
integration I don't think I need to sell

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,589
you and the benefit of that in our

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:25,850
industry what this will do however is

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:28,949
that we'll bring an open source

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,199
infrastructure for our own projects at

00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:34,500
the foundation but also for everyone to

00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:37,410
see in in the industry and open source

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,720
infrastructure so right now people who

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,889
use open source libraries in their

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,529
software or in their production pipeline

00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:48,690
have a version of that that is not open

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,670
source that has been developed

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,769
internally and each one of them is

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,990
slightly different and if you want to

00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:57,959
get into using or contributing to open

00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,660
source software you have to build one a

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,529
form of build infrastructure for

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:08,100
yourself and the dis all fine and good

00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:10,470
but it's a significant effort many

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,319
smaller studios midsize and smaller

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,720
studio shy away from open source because

00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:17,970
of those technical requirements now if

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,300
we have our CI infrastructure in the

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,220
open the hope is that it can be adopted

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,819
wholesale by some small studio who want

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,279
to get into open source and contribute

00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,930
and that it will also help the other the

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,660
bigger studios that already have an

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:38,130
infrastructure to to standardize some

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,260
practices over time there is an aspect

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,630
so obviously the Linux Foundation is is

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,870
focused on Linux the largest studios in

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,019
the motion picture business are Linux

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,699
based for their production pipelines but

00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,490
we also need support for Mac and Windows

00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:55,490
Server so that's in the plan to to

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,390
include that as well as

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:03,010
GPU for the real-time software and

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:06,170
process that are gaining traction and

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:09,260
the benefits so this slide here I will

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,080
admit is the more for our own industry

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:15,050
where we come in and we communicate and

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,770
socialize what the CI infrastructure is

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:21,470
about then for you because you you are

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,630
aware of these benefits but it'll be

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,700
farms that will come with it that we

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,610
reference build produce outside of any

00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,670
one organization as I said we want to

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,740
lower the barrier of entry and we want

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,290
to increase the adoption of something

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,380
called the VFX reference platform which

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,149
is a recommend date recommendation

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,610
platform that has been created already

00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:46,820
by volunteer in our industry so we want

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,279
to go from recommendation to action on

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,880
some of the good work that has been done

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,430
by the volunteer in our industry so we

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,430
have three projects that are tested on

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:02,000
the CI infrastructure right now openexr

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:04,700
which is a library that deals with with

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,760
high dynamic range images that existed

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,260
since a long time inside production open

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,270
cada rio that deals with color

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,690
management within a production pipeline

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:17,529
and open VDP that deal with deep data a

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,670
deep image data for doing simulation and

00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,649
explosion and all kind of things like

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:26,320
that and we're working on the windows

00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:29,060
build the information on our

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,920
infrastructure is here if someone wants

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:36,050
to come and see it and this is how to

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,029
participate so if you're interested in

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,970
the motion picture industry and you're

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,680
an engineer and you want to check out

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,660
what's going on with this foundation

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,649
this is a good point of entry we have

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:53,860
set up the lists and they and the TAC is

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:57,140
going to be formed with its own chairman

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,990
very soon and they'll be a lot to do so

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,690
we were welcoming all help we can get in

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,290
order to set up the foundation in the

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,079
years to come

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,529
I see that my clock has been reset do I

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,629
really have more time

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:13,560
okay Batman alright so I've gone through

00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:16,740
through all of it but we have we have

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,680
anecdotes to share in any number of ways

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,360
I was listening to what Van Jones was

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,689
saying in his keynote or his

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,139
presentation earlier and with great

00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:30,480
power comes great responsibility

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:32,519
everyone uses these analogies and in the

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,490
motion picture industry although the

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,499
products we make are for entertainment

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:41,189
we do feel that we have a great

00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:44,879
responsibility to carry our products in

00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:48,629
a way that inspire and and foster

00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:51,809
innovation in in the community so a

00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:55,110
really important part of this effort

00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:57,660
that we're doing is to now shine a light

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:02,160
on the engineers that have been working

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:05,279
very hard in the trenches to enable all

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,370
these great motion pictures that we've

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,839
seen on screen there are movies like

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,029
that we're on the list that I showed

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,730
earlier like The Fast and the Furious

00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:16,500
movie for instance the last one where

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,139
although it looks like a live action

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,579
will be true and true when you know how

00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,620
it was made

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,470
it's really by and large a

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,620
computer-generated movie and there was

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,569
some press that was made about in

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,470
particular in that movie when Paul

00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:36,899
Walker passed away in the middle of

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:40,500
production and he had to be recreated

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:44,250
for the duration of the of the movie

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:49,319
itself so it was an entirely software

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:52,589
based exercise to to find the best way

00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:55,170
to recreate the actors for their last

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,089
performance in the movies there's a lot

00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,279
of work that's going on to simulate the

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:02,459
world in the motion picture industry and

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,399
to render it in a way that is photo real

00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,949
so we can also create new worlds and

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,959
allow the filmmakers to bring anything

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:13,350
they want on screen no matter where it

00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,779
is in the future in the past in places

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,290
that don't exist and so that story could

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:21,240
be told in these environments so that we

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,390
can explore through our

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,980
the great what if could happen if this

00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:33,210
if that boat in from romantic committees

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,910
out to to science-fiction and more and

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,690
more this is a software-based and this

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:42,810
is the work of engineers so we want to

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:44,880
really bring a spotlight on the work of

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,920
the engineers that work in the motion

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,040
picture industry as Van Jones was

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,830
talking about writing code today is

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,660
perhaps the most powerful activity that

00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:57,030
you can do in terms of changing the

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,400
world we certainly know that it's the

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:02,430
most powerful activity you can do to

00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,880
make movies and so if you're interested

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:10,170
please don't hesitate to join us thank

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,990
you very much thanks David

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,519
thank you

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,519
