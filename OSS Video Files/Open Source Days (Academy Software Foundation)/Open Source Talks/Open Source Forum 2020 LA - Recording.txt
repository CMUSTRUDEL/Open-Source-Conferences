everyone who's online joining us this is

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,039
the second forum that we have we had one

00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:09,490
a year ago when we were just a few

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,259
months old as a foundation and now we're

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,449
growing so the purpose of this forum

00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:17,020
which we intend to be a yearly event is

00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:19,750
to give an update to the community to

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,610
our activities that we have done during

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,800
the year and to have a little bit of

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,370
discussions about also what's coming up

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,460
next and what we want to do so the

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,409
agenda as you have seen it we're going

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,089
to start quickly but at the State of the

00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:37,210
Union you all do that as fast as I can

00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:39,370
then we'll go into the core of what is

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,800
the what the foundation is about which

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,300
is the Technical Advisory Council and

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,279
the projects that we have in the

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,550
foundation and then we'll have a moment

00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,110
after that looking forward so who

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,210
mentioned this before but we have remote

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,399
attendees so we'll use the microphone

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,219
and attendees or dissertate if you have

00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,009
questions type them in and we will read

00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:01,839
them at the appropriate moment local

00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,000
attendees there's Wi-Fi information on

00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,789
the table it could is going to be useful

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,159
because we're going to start with a

00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:12,279
quick quiz we'll have a number of polls

00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:15,069
during the meeting and so this one is

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,110
just for fun but what is your favorite

00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:19,270
movie if you all go in that including

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,659

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,880
the union the second year so we are at

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,050
the end of our first year in a few

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,610
months

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:11,710
and we're starting our second year as

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,720
the board discussed this morning since

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,610
we started in august original our

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,340
original year was from August to August

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,610
we readjusted our fiscal year to be

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,800
calendar year and we had a few months

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:28,810
gaps and now we're starting our official

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,400
second year first of our chairman the

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,710
chairman of the board for the foundation

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,550
could not be with us today Robredo but

00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:40,380
he sent us a video message that we are

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,380
going to play just now

00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:51,950
in the second so rob was instrumental in

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,970
the creation of the foundation at the

00:08:51,950 --> 00:09:25,160
beginning the three years ago an

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:26,840
investigation was you're having a slight

00:09:25,160 --> 00:10:45,640
technical difficulty for the people in

00:09:26,840 --> 00:10:48,290
the zoo meeting so this is a healthy

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,040
that a lot I was very excited about

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,750
[Music]

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,880
Stevie chocolates are and one way we can

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,920
help is to point our experienced

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,230
engineers and our experienced users let

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:05,519
us speak to depicts our support forms

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:05,519
right now feeling the majority requests

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,860
them as a group of experts and provide

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,200
them with supports opposing leadership

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,560
spent more than a sewing the muscles

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:21,370
supporting that's just one concrete

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,209
thing we can do as a foundation to

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:27,459
support this exciting

00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:35,380
helping project is it our ecosphere

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:38,260
stuff but it's not we're also going to

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,709
discuss forming that work you learn a

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,779
new student participating in that didn't

00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:56,380
work I know other ways that we can

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:57,459
support us Steve identify as also stay

00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,589
out of the way where things are working

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:02,920
well so I'm excited about the agenda

00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:07,380
today I'm excited and excited to come

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,380
alongside it's our top canoe began so

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,750
that's great

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:28,840
so the word from Rob as we're moving

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,240
back so Rob's point and the audio was

00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,840
not too clear for the people online so a

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,210
quick recap so first we focused on

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,250
staying the course and what we're

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,040
already doing promoting and supporting

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,710
open source in our industry develop a

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,200
thriving ecosystem for engineers and be

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,700
the world-class host for our projects

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,860
that we want to be in that's our core

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,590
mission and we're very much staying on

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,210
that as we will see for most of the rest

00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,910
of this afternoon but then about

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,530
Universal scene description we stated

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,900
that this is an important open source

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,210
project in our industry that we want to

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,220
help and support Pixar as they're taking

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,320
on this this important project and they

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,660
open sourced it for the benefit of the

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,340
industry we want to point some of our or

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,710
our engineers who are interested to go

00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,290
to the existing farm and participate and

00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,690
help the Pixar engineer those of you who

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,090
have USD experience have started

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:25,020
implementing it already and help the

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,850
community to understand USD and then

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,040
here we're going to four more we're

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,870
going to talk about forming a working

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,850
group on universe Universal seam

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,190
description which is a new type of

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,680
activity for the foundation that that we

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,210
have done in in some ways so far but we

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,640
want to do a little bit more formalized

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,170
and also with regards to USD we want to

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,000
stay out of the way where things are

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,700
working well we're just coming in to

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,690
offer a helping hand in that important

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:55,120
project so 2020 the year of open source

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,500
in the motion picture industry heard Rob

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,660
saying in this abbreviated State of the

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,930
Union I'm going to go through what we

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,850
achieved in 2019 and then we'll talk

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,360
briefly about our goals and mission that

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,000
we set for ourselves in in 2020

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,640
so in 2019 and if we go back a few

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,440
months before that the Academy of Motion

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,800
Picture Arts and Science the SCI tech

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,560
council led by Rob and with the

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,260
collaboration of many and the Ruffini

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,180
and others got together and decided to

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,270
start an investigation around open

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,580
source as

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,410
part of that investigation and I must

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,920
say that the Academy's continuing to

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,450
help us ND and the Ricardo and and

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,370
Kathleen from the Academy are here with

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,930
us and here we are in the Academy Museum

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,620
so the hell with the Academy has been

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:48,560
invaluable thank you to the Academy and

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:51,620
as part of this investigation we came to

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,450
know the Linux Foundation and they came

00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,090
on board with us and started explaining

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,280
to us how open source is supported in

00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,590
other industries and became our partners

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,410
and ever since and we have at this table

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,030
of Emily Olin and John Moore Tech and

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,730
many others from the Linux Foundation

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,740
who are helping us with the operation of

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,750
our foundation and we couldn't have

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:16,640
we couldn't have created it without them

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:18,530
and so out of the investigation came the

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,330
decision to create the Academy Software

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,430
Foundation and they're a very important

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,440
group of companies came together our

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,240
founding members you have the list I'm

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,970
not going to read them but these

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,830
companies where core are the core the

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,530
people who kind of took a leap of faith

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,900
with some money in and some commitment

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:39,200
of engineering resources to get the

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,940
foundation started and with the these

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,400
people where these companies were

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,050
infinitely and thankful to your

00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:50,270
contribution and at the end of 2018

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,850
DreamWorks Animation deserves a very

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:55,880
special thank you proposed our first

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,160
project open VDP and they went through

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,900
all the process it was entirely new to

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,330
bring a project into the foundation and

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:08,060
that was I was hard and that was the

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,040
first and that was a bold move and we

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,370
really appreciated that you were a

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,600
trailblazer and repeats and then Sony

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,160
picture entertainment

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,620
Warner Brothers the blender foundation

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,000
and the visual effects society joined us

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,960
now 2018 2019 specifically started with

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,450
open collyrium

00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,090
joining us and gifted by Sony Pictures

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,050
Imageworks and our first open source

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,170
from a year ago

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,930
as we mentioned as I mentioned before

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:38,030
openexr shortly thereafter an open queue

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,370
where projects that joined us openexr

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,800
was gifted to the foundation by

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,319
listening and open cue

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,869
a Sony Pictures Imageworks in

00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:50,600
collaboration with Google and Nvidia

00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:54,980
joined us as well as F track and Red Hat

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,889
in july 2019 open timeline i/o from

00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,529
pixar was also gifted to the foundation

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:03,559
and Netflix Amazon Web Services rodeo

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:06,559
effects movie labs and our first open

00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,480
source day which was our meeting at

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,470
SIGGRAPH where we regrouped a lot of

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,209
birds of a feather into one track in

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:17,029
September but then we had our open

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,250
source landscape that Daniel will talk

00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:23,360
about a little more later and we had our

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:25,789
first case study of or interviews of

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,649
engineers behind the screens and both

00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:30,169
Apple and Microsoft joined us at that

00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:31,820
time and by the end of the year we reach

00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,220
a million dollar in nearly founding

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,370
commitments from 23 members companies

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:40,880
and this is a group we have assembled

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:43,640
here and to all of you thank you

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,789
infinitely for making the foundation

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,940
possible we created the foundation to be

00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:52,730
and we also have 17 full-time equivalent

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,520
developers now on in the wings ready to

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,500
work on projects for the first two years

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,320
the assignment of the full-time

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,029
engineers are to any of our project or

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,179
any open source projects but eventually

00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:07,639
they'll move on engineering for our

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:11,179
foundation projects so this is the group

00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:12,889
and and this is an amazing group of

00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:14,690
pioneers that believe that software as

00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:16,460
are in the motion picture industry is

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,200
fundamental and do we need to get

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,159
together for a certain type of software

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,559
and work together the structure of the

00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,960
foundation is like this the Technical

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,330
Advisory Council is the core of the

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,480
foundation this is where the engineering

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,399
group stand led by Danielle Eichenberg

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,010
the governing board is there on the side

00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:38,299
to help the tech clear the way and make

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,370
sure that they have the resource to do

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,440
what they want to do and under the tack

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,360
we have our projects that are built on a

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,809
continuous integration platform that's

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,950
the basic structure of our foundation

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:51,380
talking a little bit more about open

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,600
source day at SIGGRAPH all the

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,480
presentation that we did at SIGGRAPH are

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,669
recorded on our website so anyone who

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,450
wants to get the latest update up to

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:06,080
today on the projects can go there and

00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,460
let's listen to do to those recording we

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,649
also have the behind the screen this is

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,870
one of them on Pilar Melina Lopez an

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,340
engineer at Blue Sky Studios we're going

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,659
to do a lot more of them we want to

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,580
highlight the work of the software

00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:18,529
engineer in our industry you can go

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,139
there read the profiles and send people

00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:23,919
to them as we encourage the the work of

00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:28,190
engineers in the motion picture industry

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:30,740
so 2020 as I have four minutes left I'm

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,350
going to go into quickly our goals and

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,020
targets so first of all we are building

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,240
on the strong phase and momentum that we

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,279
gathered since we created the foundation

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,320
so not what you're going to hear about

00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,120
today about the projects and what what

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,669
is happening what's going on is our core

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,669
activity which regards to funding with

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:52,580
for 2020 we are focusing on general

00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:56,059
members which are which is the class of

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:58,130
member member companies that don't have

00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,649
to do as big a commitment either on

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,260
money or in engineering and bring them

00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:06,049
in bring more of them into the company

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,730
which equates to smaller studios studios

00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:10,669
that are maybe less familiar with open

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,980
source that want to that are maybe users

00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:15,230
or open source but not contributor we

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,940
want to focus on them and explain to

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,639
them the value that the foundation has

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,919
and and bring them in and with that we

00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:24,440
intend to increase slightly our

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,970
operating revenue by the end of the year

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,090
which is very important for this

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:31,220
foundation to be well funded to help all

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,429
the projects in the and what we want to

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,120
do and with regards to project we are of

00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:40,130
course continuing a really structured

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,470
system or process for welcoming new

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,080
projects any projects can be submitted

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:48,200
to the foundation by exterior entity the

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:52,639
foundation is not going to take over

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,809
projects or I'm going to take projects

00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:55,279
that are existing they have to be

00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:56,840
submitted by their owner and that

00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,360
process is well documented in our

00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,070
website and what Edition in addition

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,500
we're going to create working group for

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,539
exploration of new and larger projects

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,549
we are going to talk about that little

00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,350
later and on the outreach side we're

00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,929
going to focus on

00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:14,549
versity and raising the profile suffered

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:18,370
in software engineers in our industry so

00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:19,990
working group what does that mean so the

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,490
working groups we are going to be

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,059
defined by the Technical Advisory

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:27,669
Council there I'm going to have to in

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:30,070
the definition phase have a lead have a

00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:32,380
clear goal at a process to get to the

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,289
goal and the finit duration in time and

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,580
once a working group has been defined it

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:38,620
will be reviewed by the got the

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,350
Governing Board will talk of practical

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:45,429
examples of that a little later this is

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:48,460
our timeline for 2020 we are currently

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:50,950
in January at the open source farm we're

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,470
participating in a number of conferences

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,559
and and outreach activities throughout

00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:00,250
the year our other big meeting will be

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,980
at SIGGRAPH in Washington DC and on that

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,720
question I have another quiz I would

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,330
like to the question is do you plan to

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,549
go to SIGGRAPH in Washington DC because

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,860
it's not in the usual location so if you

00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:18,820
can please and take a minute to answer

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:20,860
the poll we are going to go to SIGGRAPH

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,299
in Washington DC the Academy Software

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,370
Foundation and we plan to have our

00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,909
second open source day with that

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,890
question we're just trying to gauge

00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:32,169
roughly how big SIGGRAPH will be this

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,130
year in terms of attendees and people

00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:41,980
are making the decision to go or not

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:43,840
we'll stop at 50 and 48 all right so

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,870
majority is going to SIGGRAPH that's

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,289
good and we have a higher number than

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,280
usual and that are not quite sure yet

00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:52,830
number you're not going thank you very

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,610
much for that

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:59,860
so in terms of our higher level mission

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,659
if you want we've seen this many of you

00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,179
here in the room have been doing this

00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:05,740
presentation or the Academy Software

00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:08,919
Foundation is there to provide a neutral

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,570
forum for open source software developer

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,539
in the motion picture in broader media

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,640
industry the point that's important here

00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:17,260
is the neutral forum we've never had

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,390
something like the Academy Software

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,710
Foundation in the motion picture

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,750
industry there are a lot of

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,820
organization and committees and and

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,340
guilds and societies that put up

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,870
meetings and do all kind of things the

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,640
neutral forum for the development of

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,529
software this is something that is new

00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,120
and this is something that we need to

00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:37,760
learn to take advantage of as a

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,070
community we already have a number of

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,279
initiatives in progress but we can do

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:46,039
more and better and as we grow the

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,260
foundation moving forward the mission

00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,539
specifically is about increasing the

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,250
quality and quantity of open-source

00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:54,140
contribution and we've established this

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,659
governance model legal framework

00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:00,590
community infrastructure you're the

00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:02,120
barrier to entry to our products and I'm

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,690
not going to go to the goals these were

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,630
our goals from 2019 friendliest in the

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,390
interest of time continue well briefly

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,370
continuous integration that allows us to

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,350
share open source build configuration a

00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,630
clear path of participation and more

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,919
consistent licensing these are work in

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,010
progress because we did a lot of

00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,169
progress on these four goals in 2020 as

00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:27,140
I mentioned before we're adding two

00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:28,850
additional goal explore new and larger

00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,309
projects through working groups and

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,250
increase focus on developer diversity

00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:36,380
and inclusion how to participate you

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,929
probably all know this but where our

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,390
website is rich in information now and

00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:45,710
also make sure that you're following us

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,940
on social media that was my quick State

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,000
of the Union I will now pass the

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:59,330
microphone to Danielle Eichenberg will

00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:01,640
give us the update and attack hi

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,919
everyone and welcome again to those

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,720
people who are dialing in once again

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,700
just a reminder if you've joined late

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:15,440
please flag any questions or feedback

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:18,740
you might have by the Xoom chat so as we

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,750
have a nice collection of people who've

00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,390
been very actively involved in the

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,340
activities of the foundation and some of

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,380
its structures and components in

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,299
projects and attack and so on as well as

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,279
a more a broader community here who's

00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,660
been involved with the history of the

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,940
foundation and

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,010
active in the in the industry and

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,050
community generally I'll give a little

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,070
bit of a summary of some of the things

00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,840
that have happened over the first year

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,570
but without going into too much detail

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,550
in particular I won't dwell on what's

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,350
happened in the projects themselves

00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,970
because we'll be hearing from the

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,160
project chairs themselves who'll be able

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,830
to dive into a lot of the specifics that

00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,810
really represent the value that the

00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:02,390
foundation attempts to bring to this

00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:04,910
community so as David introduced the

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,550
technical advisory committee plays a

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:11,210
role to try and coordinate across the

00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:13,520
projects and of course in our founding

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:17,000
process a key activity there was

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,400
actually adopting projects now that we

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,200
have a significant number of effective

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,180
and active projects our focus starts to

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,120
shift of course to other activities to

00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,620
support those projects and the projects

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,060
themselves provide a lot of the energy

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:33,830
to keep moving the foundation forward

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,780
within this of course the CI

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,380
infrastructure was a big focus early on

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,390
and that is our first successful model

00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,820
of the working group structure that

00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,670
David outlined earlier this is obviously

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,040
an area where it's of great interest to

00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:52,070
all of our projects but also as a good

00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,810
opportunity for us to bring in skills

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,850
and expertise from other people outside

00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:58,220
of the projects which it's definitely

00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,660
done it involves skill sets which might

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,390
not actually be within any one of the

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,370
projects themselves and it also

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,050
sometimes has to be able to appeal for

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,820
funding and resources and other things

00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:11,330
from their foundations so the working

00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:15,380
group structures serve that well through

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:18,260
the association with the TAC as part of

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,990
the process of smoothing and aiding

00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,360
adoption and also making it possible for

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,610
us to engage with a broader pool of

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,920
developers a large focus of the first

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,450
year is on licensing and contribution

00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,740
processes and I have a slide on some of

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,850
the details the progress that we've made

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:37,970
there another area in order to try and

00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:40,280
really establish a good basis of best

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,810
practice in a way within that within the

00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,780
code so we improve the quality of code

00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:46,400
as one of our goals in a way that is

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,470
actually stable and maintainable

00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,540
over the duration of the project so not

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:55,430
just a scrutiny that happens at the time

00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:57,080
of a projects adoption was by joining

00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,390
into the core infrastructure initiative

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,010
badge process and all of the projects

00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,650
that have graduated now the three

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,030
projects that have graduated about five

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,460
have after achieving those goals

00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:09,740
maintain them you'll see that those the

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,570
passing grade is clearly seen on their

00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,250
website and that indicates this is

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,710
actually an ongoing process an indicator

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,070
of those quality standards being met and

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:22,670
maintained finally another area where we

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:25,100
are attempting to canalize best practice

00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,930
and facilitate project adoption is by

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,370
capturing many of the projects that go

00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:31,250
many of the aspects that go into

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,950
starting anew a SWF project and linking

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:37,370
in with some of our systems like CLA and

00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:39,050
with our CI system is by setting up a

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,680
simple template project again that was

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:46,040
worked on in the scope of our CI working

00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:49,190
group and has provided a valuable path

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,320
to actually realize and make visible

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,860
some of those processes that came out of

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,140
long discussions within the other groups

00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:59,810
one area that as we now move forward

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:03,230
from a strictly project adoption into

00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:05,570
the longer growth of the foundation is

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:07,220
developer engagement so there are a few

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,200
key aspects to that and I suspect

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,480
that'll be a topic we talk about a lot

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,860
in the discussions today this was

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,750
highlighted in the surveys that we

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,880
undertook with our membership as being

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,830
one of the areas we really should focus

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,380
on not only for the sake of the

00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,540
foundation and the industry as a whole

00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,220
but also obviously in order to serve the

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,740
needs of the projects that we have some

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,650
of which have very clear timelines and

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,720
roadmaps to deliver you know effective

00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,420
value to all of the projects that

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,610
further depend on them but where we need

00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,440
to be able to use the resources and

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,820
mechanisms of foundation to help and

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,130
resource those things

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,720
the idea of support for USD is another

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,800
example where we might seek to do so

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,150
somewhat outside of the project context

00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,100
another aspect of this of course is

00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,450
making sure that we broaden our

00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,290
engagement with the development

00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:59,120
community and in doing so we can really

00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,990
try and improve the diversity inclusion

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,030
that at the

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,710
in terms of representation and also in

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,480
terms of the processes and how we go

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,930
about actually making sure that a broad

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,190
variety of voices is heard all of our

00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,280
processes with the tach

00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:16,160
are open so I would encourage you to

00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,140
follow through and follow along with the

00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,220
TAC mailing list and use that to ask any

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,440
questions

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,790
whilst we do have a core set of voting

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,040
members on the tach

00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:27,590
the meetings are all open and we would

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,140
encourage anyone to join with issues we

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,760
have a process for an open process for

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,670
adding topics for discussion and so on

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,920
so this really is done in the spirit of

00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:39,080
being able to provide this open in

00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:43,640
neutral forum for collaboration in ways

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,920
that might not otherwise exist so a

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,620
little more on the subject of developer

00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,270
engagement we've spoken quite a lot

00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,910
about outreach about trying to reach

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,190
people who might not you know already be

00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:57,920
part of the community as it as it stands

00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:01,040
and in fact there is some good examples

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,210
of how we are taking some concrete steps

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,360
to do so

00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,890
Larry grits who's here has been leading

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,380
a bit of a charge to set up the

00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,820
foundation as an organization for the

00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,800
google Summer of Code this year and all

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,260
of our projects have subscribed into

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,460
that process as well but another big

00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:21,470
area is is what has has been coined in

00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,890
reach which is actually making sure that

00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,570
we are able to harness and appeal to

00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,070
developers already within our community

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,870
and our gauge but actually make it

00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,210
easier and possibly for them to

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,710
contribute to our projects and make it

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,390
clear what the value proposition is for

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,790
their organizations and other other

00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:41,240
points of access in order to actually

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:44,630
appeal to those experienced and highly

00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,710
skilled developers what aspect of this

00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,280
of course is actually making our

00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:51,910
projects accessible so another theme for

00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,620
our goals for the TAC this year beyond

00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,240
project and process accessibility for

00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,740
project adoption is actually to make

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,540
sure that the projects themselves at a

00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,910
deeper level are more accessible by

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:04,040
working on some of the web material in

00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,690
other presentations which are a little

00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,730
aged in the case of some of our projects

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,340
and also of course bringing our

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:14,060
documentation other processes up to best

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:16,280
practice I'll make another sure

00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:20,330
no two about the working group as an

00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:22,850
interesting piece of strategy for

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:27,400
developer engagement so where our

00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:30,290
projects of course Duke and can include

00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,330
activity from developers outside of the

00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,610
foundation and we encourage that and

00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,260
there's many examples of this already

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,720
working group provide another model

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:41,540
again for us to appeal to and engage

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,060
with developers and organizations

00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,830
without that necessarily involving

00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,450
membership that's important for the

00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,220
community generally and it also allows a

00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,930
statistic tart to engage with groups so

00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,030
that they can understand what the

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:58,760
foundation might offer them in a future

00:32:53,030 --> 00:33:00,560
point back into the details so those of

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,380
us who were present for many of the

00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,230
early summits and other processes that

00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,340
led to the formation of the foundation

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:10,010
will remember that there were many

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,830
discussions about licensing and IP

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:15,830
arrangements as bottlenecks and

00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,300
obstacles to contributions something

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,430
that had occurred in many of our

00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:23,030
projects and indeed the projects we have

00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:26,240
adopted were slight modifications on

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:29,570
standard OSI licenses and through the

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,250
process of both adoption and second pass

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,080
streamlining we've managed to do good

00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,850
work to actually standardize many of

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,440
those licenses so that they are much

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,140
more straightforward and recognizable

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,370
and pose less risk for organizations

00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:45,950
that might seek to enable their

00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:47,330
developers to contribute this is a slide

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,820
that I won't go into a lot of detail

00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,150
about but I will make a couple of notes

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,230
about the path that we took for

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,640
establishing the CI infrastructure which

00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,120
now all of our projects are making use

00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:05,000
of when we were initially scoping this

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:07,210
work we had a goal or a mandate to make

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,130
sure that this infrastructure would be

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,840
completely reproducible repr forcible so

00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,730
the studios could essentially spin up

00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,320
this infrastructure inside their own

00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,180
environments as a way of dealing with

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,100
some of the typical sort of network

00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:24,440
security and isolation issues in our in

00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:25,850
our in our environment as we progress

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,859
through this we realized that there was

00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:30,679
a bit of a disjunction between

00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:32,690
that kind of approach and what was much

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,279
more familiar to open source project

00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:38,960
workflows and the way that many of the

00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:41,239
key systems for CI and software quality

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,009
had moved to software as a service style

00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,319
models so we actually made the

00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:46,609
deliberate choice to switch this to a

00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:50,480
workflow which made use of those

00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:52,519
services in their public forms and this

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,999
has had good value for us in terms of

00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:58,190
being able to allow for workflows on

00:34:55,999 --> 00:35:01,609
individual project and developer Forks

00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,980
to be completely compatible and to make

00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:05,710
use of these public resources it's also

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,829
meant that we're able to leverage

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:11,210
software as a service through the open

00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:13,029
source arrangements that most of those

00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,349
services provide to do so without

00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:16,579
running the infrastructure ourselves so

00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:20,900
these are all important advantage that

00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:23,230
we've been able to achieve we've spoken

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,509
a lot and we concentrated a lot on

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:28,069
adopting a number of key important and

00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:31,309
in some cases a little bit troubled

00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:32,960
projects in our first year of course as

00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:35,989
we now expand our view to the sort of

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,099
health and the broader ecosystem it's

00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:40,089
important to be able to actually get

00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:41,960
some sort of view and map of that so

00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:44,660
John and others in the Linux Foundation

00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,059
were able to bring a very effective view

00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,440
of this for our industry by repurposing

00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:51,069
some of the technology that came from

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,599
one of their other projects and form the

00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:56,029
SWF landscape which actually allows us

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,339
to see how our already adopted projects

00:35:56,029 --> 00:36:00,529
for dinners Keystone's in many of the

00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:02,269
areas of our industry but also to see

00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:03,890
the many other open source projects that

00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:05,900
exist around them and that are within

00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:10,130
our mandate as the foundation to help an

00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,569
aid and support and with that let's get

00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,090
into the exciting details of the

00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,169
projects

00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,169
[Music]

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,430
Emily has prompted me to actually ask

00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:23,690
some difficult questions I wasn't quite

00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,390
prepared for that till later but let's

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:28,489
see let's see what you've got

00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,989
I've got a little time so would anyone

00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:31,519
like to stop now and ask questions of

00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:33,289
course we'll have lots of time for a

00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,069
broader discussion after the project

00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:36,069
presentations as well

00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,650
one thing I want to say about the

00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,030
landscape that Daniel just presented on

00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,070
our website it's an interactive

00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:53,260
landscape that allows you to search for

00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:55,990
projects in our industry so I invite you

00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,870
to go and and visit it it's a good tool

00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:01,060
to get a sense of the many projects that

00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,710
are related to our industry and get to

00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,780
their website and you can view the

00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:12,310
landscape in different forms it's been a

00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:17,740
great tool do we have any question from

00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:19,900
the online group are there any

00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,670
guidelines advice to help developers to

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:28,450
convince their studio to open-source

00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:32,560
some internal projects at this stage no

00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,880
I think that the all of the projects

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,890
that we have and in fact all of the

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,000
community of developers and others that

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,620
are engaged with the foundation or

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,050
obviously ready to have that

00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:44,230
conversation with any interested

00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,820
individuals and I would direct them to

00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,860
do so you know through the public

00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,720
mechanisms that the TAC and mailing

00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,630
lists offer up or indeed through more

00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,450
private contacting that's appropriate

00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:57,670
and added in the chat a link to a

00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,100
resource the links foundation has a

00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:03,190
project called the to do group which is

00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:05,580
a group of open-source program office

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,860
leaders across many different industries

00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:11,680
big small they put together a series of

00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,440
guides that talk about how you as an

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,400
organization participate in open source

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,440
if you're wanting to kind of measure

00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,730
your open source developer impact and

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,400
then pertinent to this call a

00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,840
conversation here how do you get started

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,590
in open source how do you bring a

00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,360
project from internal to external so I'd

00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,250
encourage if this is something you're

00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,100
interested in your and your organization

00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,930
take a look at a number of these guides

00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:40,180
and maybe we can also tap you into some

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:41,650
of the experts behind them excellent now

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,810
I'm keen to leave as much time for the

00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,390
projects as possible because they have

00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:49,030
lots of good news to be able to share so

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,950
we may take the time now to pass over to

00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:56,589
I believe open color

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:58,390
our first project everyone

00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:02,589
this is Michael Dolan can you hear me

00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:04,329
okay yes again alright great so I

00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:07,390
couldn't be there but I'll be

00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:09,280
introducing y'all to open color and kind

00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,099
of giving some updates on what we've

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,260
been up to this past year and then Doug

00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:17,290
Walker will talk a little bit about open

00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,970
Cole area version two and you know our

00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,089
progress in that this year and where

00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:27,130
we're headed this coming year so we

00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:29,319
could go to the next slide so just the

00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,970
general overview of what opened Colorado

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:32,559
is a lot of you are probably familiar

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,109
with it but it's an Academy Award

00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,410
winning color management library

00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:39,819
targeting motion picture production it's

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,980
it's used widely and a lot of the

00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:44,740
effects and animation studios and both

00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,690
commercial and proprietary software the

00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,960
goal you know has been to have a

00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,890
consistent user experience across all of

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,280
our digital content creation

00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,930
applications that we use you know so

00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,390
that whether you're at Maya or in

00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:00,490
Houdini or nuke or katana or wherever

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,010
that you're artists are seeing the same

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,839
you know color appearance and even

00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,270
though underlying data is represented

00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,359
whatever makes sense for your production

00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:13,059
needs and then the system is highly

00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:14,829
configurable and its intended to be very

00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:17,319
performant so that involves Harbor

00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:21,760
acceleration we can process color on CPU

00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:23,680
and GPU etc so open Colorado was started

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,430
at Sony Pictures Imageworks and it was

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,130
open sourced in 2010 was Imageworks

00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:33,819
sixth project as part of their open

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:36,339
source initiative and I was very widely

00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:38,890
adopted following that and then in 2017

00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:39,640
after some you know quiet times on the

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,640
project

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,530
Autodesk made a proposal about kind of

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,000
like bringing the project back to life

00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:48,280
and adding a lot of valuable

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,410
functionality given you know a lot had

00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,880
changed in the industry over the you

00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,710
know previous number of years and so

00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,359
they proposed open Calero version two

00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:00,609
and had committed full-time engineers to

00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:03,130
work on it until it's completed and so

00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:04,630
that's been going on and in 2019 we

00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,930
became the second project

00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:10,210
join the Software Foundation and it's

00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:13,570
been a you know a good a good move and

00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:18,430
the project's very doing very well if we

00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:20,290
could go to the next slide so right

00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,390
around now marks our one-year

00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:24,640
anniversary and the Academy Software

00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:26,830
Foundation and throughout this this past

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,380
year and the meet this meeting last year

00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,280
we had just kind of gotten in and with

00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,410
this past year we went through

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,710
incubation and we have officially

00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:37,450
graduated to adopted project status as

00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:39,490
you know we had to take care of quite a

00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:41,950
few details to make that happen but made

00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:44,920
the project much more better or much

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:47,320
better as a result you know just dealing

00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,570
with governance and licensing and lots

00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,160
of just details to make sure we're you

00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:54,310
know adhering to the best practices for

00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,570
open source projects so RT SC or

00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:59,680
technical steering committee we meet

00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:01,480
Mondays at 9:30 a.m. Pacific times it's

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,510
open to the public welcome anyone who

00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,280
has interest in learning more or being a

00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:10,170
part of what Oakland Calero is doing

00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:14,080
currently our committee has members from

00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:16,120
Imageworks autodesk double- epic games

00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,480
foundry Framestore ILM and lettuce so we

00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,100
have a good mix of membership and we

00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,990
also have regular participation from

00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,660
Netflix and Linux Foundation and and

00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:29,470
others as well from x times so it's it's

00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:32,140
been it's a pretty good mix in wide you

00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:34,270
know representation in our community we

00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,160
this past year one thing we did on our

00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,920
TSC was we added a new leadership role

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,570
because our project is so you know

00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,070
tightly knitted with aces and they're

00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,840
both these color management projects

00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:46,480
they're both widely used in our industry

00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,070
we added an aces tech rep role to our

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,830
leadership of our TSC

00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:52,270
that's Sean Cooper at Dean egg and just

00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,490
to kind of help keep the projects and

00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:57,460
stuff in talking with each other so

00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,840
that's been a positive move part of this

00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,150
incubations past year was a lot of

00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,880
infrastructure initiatives as Daniel was

00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,310
talking about our you know working with

00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,640
a lot of a CI and so we overhauled our

00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:12,070
CI systems this past year and you know

00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,900
in Azure and Sona cloud and and we did

00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:16,030
that very tightly with the other

00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,020
projects as a part of the foundation and

00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,520
within the CI working group and so

00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,110
it was a very collaborative process that

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,810
I think all the projects really

00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:26,150
benefited from you know having each team

00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:28,369
kind of take part and you know lead the

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:31,700
way on different initiatives we're

00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:35,150
currently I'm kind of setting up the

00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,470
first GPU CI usage within the foundation

00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,850
and jf panas that's kind of leading the

00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,860
way with that he did a lot of he's been

00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,240
doing a lot of research and contributing

00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,140
that to the project which is greatly

00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,730
appreciated we also you know in for open

00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,320
collar area we don't yet have Python 3

00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,720
support and so we're currently working

00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,210
on developing new PI bi and 11 based

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,820
bindings to add Python 3 support which

00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:58,400
is definitely needed this year to keep

00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:01,880
with the FX reference platform okay go

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,790
to the next slide so this slide is going

00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,080
to give you a bit of a glimpse into the

00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:10,630
activity of our project over the last

00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:13,490
year this top graphic is our github

00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,110
activity over the past decade and on the

00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,030
bottom is the last three years of our

00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:19,430
slack community so you'll see at the top

00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,410
that our activity over the past year in

00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,900
github has has been consistent and

00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,210
strong and it's really grown and we had

00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:29,210
200 for March pull requests this year

00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:32,090
you know which is great and 24 she's

00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:34,070
closed in 19 countries yeah unique

00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,619
contributors so pretty wide

00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:40,550
representation contributing you know

00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:42,050
code as well we have 87 slack users and

00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,940
if you look on our graph here you can

00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,980
see there's about 20 to 30 active at a

00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,780
time that's people who are contributing

00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,640
to the conversation and checking

00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,920
regularly so pretty good representation

00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,740
and and one actually positive thing is

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,730
here was we rebooted our mail list which

00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,280
used to be at Google Groups

00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,760
and it was moved to list a SWF diet oh

00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,040
when we became part of the foundation

00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,810
which required all of our subscribers to

00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,990
essentially Reece absque ribe no one was

00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:12,140
carried over and so we have 121

00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:14,150
subscribers doe CEO dev at 179 to a user

00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,940
so showing that you know there's pretty

00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,590
good you know the representation there

00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,810
as well and people that are contributing

00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,460
to the conversation and with that I'm

00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,410
going to hand it over to Doug Walker to

00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:29,119
talk about Oakland Colorado version 2

00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:30,750
thanks Michael so greetings from

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,880
Montreal I'm

00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,190
Walker I worked for Autodesk I'm the

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,760
technology lead for color science here

00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:44,010
and I'm serving as the chief architect

00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:49,380
role on the OCIO TSC so as Michael said

00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:52,770
we are in midst of a big project called

00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:55,860
OCIO v2 what I'm showing here is the

00:45:52,770 --> 00:46:00,050
list of features that we validated with

00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:04,050
the community back in 2017 at SIGGRAPH

00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:07,500
the dark bars are kind of where we were

00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:11,370
at SIGGRAPH last year and the light bars

00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:13,800
are where we are now so as Michael

00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:16,950
mentioned Autodesk has three full-time

00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,800
engineers working on this we are merging

00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:23,190
code into the master branch on github on

00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,830
a weekly basis I'm not going to try to

00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:28,620
go through all the this whole list but I

00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:31,800
just wanted to pick up on something

00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:35,190
Michael said earlier which is that we

00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,140
have we're very interested in in working

00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:41,010
closely with aces and we have a number

00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:43,410
of features on the b2 list that are

00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:47,280
intended to integrate more closely with

00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:50,700
aces and in fact we're just wrapping up

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,890
support for the new commonlook format

00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:57,330
specification that is part of the new

00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:59,850
aces 1.2 release a number of us are

00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:02,610
working that are working on OClO are

00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:04,760
also very involved very involved in aces

00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:10,140
and the way I like to think of it is

00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:12,240
aces is the what and OCIO is the how so

00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,730
in other words aces provides standards

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,460
for what color transforms to apply and

00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:19,410
OCIO provides a great way for how to

00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:23,750
apply those in an efficient and flexible

00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:26,780
way next slide please

00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:30,180
so looking forward to the year ahead

00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:33,570
this will be a big year for OCIO roadmap

00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:36,690
is to be feature complete with v2 at

00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:39,330
SIGGRAPH and then the second half of the

00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:42,780
year will be helping people integrate

00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:44,120
Ozio v2 into their apps and doing beta

00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,810
testing

00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,940
and our goal is to be in the VFX

00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:55,270
reference platform so that applications

00:47:49,940 --> 00:48:01,040
can start shipping in calendar year 2021

00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:02,630
next line so this is how to contact us

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,150
and get involved in the project we're

00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:07,970
looking for contributors not only on the

00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:11,480
development side but also with respect

00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:13,730
to testing and documentation so if you'd

00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,550
like to learn more please get in touch

00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:19,540
with us and that concludes our

00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:19,540
presentation Thanks

00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:32,450
any questions woody I don't see any in

00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:34,700
the chat if somebody has any questions

00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:48,940
in the chat feel free to raise them and

00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:48,940
we'll move on 3 2 1 X project open queue

00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,350
all right hello everyone i'm brian

00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,720
seprieono from Google I'm the

00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:07,300
chairperson of the steering committee of

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,220
open queue and I'm just going to take

00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,480
you through a a little bit about what

00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,640
we've been doing with open queue and

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,710
what our what our plans are for the next

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,690
upcoming year

00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:19,000
I won't go into too much detail here but

00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:21,880
for folks who don't know what open queue

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,750
is it is a job management and scheduling

00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:28,150
platform it's is mostly designed for the

00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:31,300
media space rendering particular but

00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:33,130
really any any kind of paralyzed double

00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,140
work you want to do can be put onto the

00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:38,350
system whether that's you know rendering

00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,630
pausing running backups and really any

00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,750
kind of work you want to distribute it's

00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:45,610
a centralized system with no kind of

00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:49,390
centralized job management piece and

00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:50,830
database and some software that runs on

00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:54,670
each of your worker nodes and

00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:56,290
workstations and some client side pieces

00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:00,700
for for interacting with the system

00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:05,200
Python API job description system and a

00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:06,910
bunch of GUI tools as well so it started

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,230
it's it's been around at some form for a

00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:15,460
long time started around 2003 as it was

00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:17,950
named q3 back then at SP I and it's kind

00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:21,540
of kind of built up for a while over the

00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:24,070
years and then around around mid in 2018

00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,790
Sony and Google started working together

00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:30,040
to open-source it so there was that was

00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:32,560
a big projects kind of untangling it for

00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,090
a bunch of other SPI of the structure

00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,080
and prepping it for the open source

00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:40,960
release and we wrap that up around

00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:43,150
January 2019 so it is just about just

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,820
about a year old we've just recently had

00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,340
our one year anniversary a few months

00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,510
after that then we joined the a SWF I

00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,970
think we were the maybe the fourth

00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:53,350
project to join and a little bit

00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:55,720
different than the other projects which

00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,310
are kind of lower-level dependencies

00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,650
this is more of a multi component system

00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:01,060
so there's been a lot of kind of

00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:03,640
interesting work that we've done sit

00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,320
again as the first net space in the

00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,580
software foundation but a lot of the

00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,170
tools that we're using are all the same

00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:11,720
ones that the you know the rest

00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:15,740
the foundation is using a build system

00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,849
release system all that and so we've

00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,349
been able to kind of share a lot of that

00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:22,700
stuff as well even though we're quite

00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:24,619
different so some of the stuff we've

00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,420
done in the past year well like I said

00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:27,829
it's been it's about our one-year

00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,710
anniversary so that the open source

00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:33,049
release was the biggest one of course

00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:34,670
that came along with a lot of some

00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:37,160
initial packaging to help help folks get

00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:40,040
it up and running docker support was a

00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,349
big one for a lot of the pieces and then

00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,390
since then we've kind of moved along to

00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:47,089
a lot of the more popular feature

00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:49,309
requests so one of the first things we

00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:51,170
put into place was a kind of arbitrary

00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:53,150
limit system this is for like managing

00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,799
fixed amounts of licenses and then

00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,220
making sure you you know you're able to

00:51:54,799 --> 00:52:00,530
to utilize your license pool properly

00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:02,930
we've done we have full Python 3 support

00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:06,890
now it was a big project about about 50%

00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:10,430
of our code is is Python other 50% in

00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:12,079
Java so it was a big big push to get

00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:14,000
that all in place before the end of the

00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,940
year and keep up with the reference

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,710
platform but that's all about now and it

00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:24,410
was also a prerequisite to doing Windows

00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:27,760
support within the platform so far it's

00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:29,990
been all all Linux based but as of

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,510
actually just this week we announced our

00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:35,869
the alpha of our our Windows program so

00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:38,150
we're able to run they run jobs on on

00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:40,400
Windows and launch them from those

00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:41,720
workstations now there's some

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,339
limitations there it's still you know

00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,010
it's an it's an alpha for a reason

00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:48,140
you know some especially around

00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:51,500
packaging of the windows components

00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,790
logging stuff like that but we're really

00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,660
excited to get that out because it's

00:52:52,790 --> 00:53:01,460
been a very very popular feature request

00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:03,440
ever since we launched and then the

00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,670
other thing that we've done is a you

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,020
know in the past year we've set up the

00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,569
whole the whole project project

00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,500
governance structure and I'll go into

00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:11,660
that some more and then on the next

00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,859
slide I've linked here and sure we'll

00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,049
show the slides out later but I've

00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:16,940
linked here release notes on our website

00:53:15,049 --> 00:53:18,859
that have lots of other smaller future

00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,010
feature requests we've done stuff like

00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:21,010
that

00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:26,299
so yeah that'd be the project governance

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,950
structure so we set up the steering

00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:30,589
committee like all the other foundation

00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:34,009
projects we have open meetings every

00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:35,569
other week mailing lists which are also

00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:37,880
linked here you know user a developer

00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:40,190
lists and there's a lot of good

00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,609
conversation that goes on there doing

00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:45,079
monthly releases of the whole system for

00:53:43,609 --> 00:53:47,359
folks who aren't you know pulling from

00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:50,089
our from the master branch on github and

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,819
then a few of the stats here that I've

00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:54,259
listed you can see kind of show what of

00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:55,869
what contributions looked like in the

00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:58,460
last year and this has really been the

00:53:55,869 --> 00:54:00,559
kind of most encouraging thing I've seen

00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,299
about the the project is that you know

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,210
though the as you can see from PRS

00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:07,190
merged the kind of piece that of which

00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,720
were merging code and closing issues

00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:11,420
hasn't really picked up the the pool of

00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,279
contribute that has grown quite a lot we

00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,630
have a really good kind of base of folks

00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:18,980
who are contributing regularly to it now

00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:20,119
whether that's code or Doc's or just you

00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,190
know could you read it to discussions

00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:24,950
and meetings the contributors here are

00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:27,650
specifically like folks who have merged

00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:28,940
code so those numbers are all really

00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,359
encouraging and and going in the right

00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:33,380
direction and kind of the one of the

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:35,569
biggest challenges as new open source

00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,789
projects I think it's to gonna get

00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:41,420
beyond that initial pool of initial

00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:46,519
committers and and involve more folks so

00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:49,279
that's all good a few things that we're

00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:51,859
gonna work on over the next year better

00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:54,859
support for cross platform jobs with

00:54:51,859 --> 00:54:56,839
directory mapping whole user management

00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:59,809
system with with fine-grained

00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:02,150
permissions more packaging with for all

00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:04,670
the different platforms and make it

00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:08,809
easier to use and install and run the

00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:10,940
program lots of new documentation that's

00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:14,210
been working with some tech riders so it

00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,109
helped us on that so that's all going in

00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,720
a good direction and we're gonna

00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:20,539
continue with that and we want to keep

00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,309
growing the contributor pool as well so

00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:25,989
and then one of the other things that

00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:28,609
the CII badge that was mentioned in the

00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,900
earlier was that and that's something

00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:33,570
that we haven't been able to focus on

00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:35,460
too much as a kind of new project

00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,660
or at least a newly-released project

00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,550
we've been focusing a lot more on the

00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:40,650
kind of initial feature requests that

00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:42,090
we've gotten so that's going to get the

00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,680
CI badge we get more attention over the

00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,930
next year make sure that we get up to

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,930
pace with the rest of the projects I

00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:51,180
think we're about 80% done with that now

00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:53,460
and there's much more on our on our

00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:57,780
public github page if you want to see

00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:59,450
what we're working on lots of stuff here

00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:03,900
if you're interested in getting involved

00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:06,840
main website the docs code different

00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,550
mailing lists and you know all of our

00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,050
TSC meetings are open as well if you uh

00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:14,330
if you ever want to join those those are

00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:22,080
posted on our on our public calendar and

00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:31,290
yeah I think that's about it any

00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:34,170
question for open Q Brian you've any

00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:36,750
data on how many studios currently

00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:38,730
adopted oh oh thank you yeah that's

00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:40,200
something that we've that we need to do

00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,460
more work on is collecting that sort of

00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,610
data we don't really have anything like

00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:46,830
that right now we may have we can we can

00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:48,270
get us kind of a sense of it from the

00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:50,640
the contributions we're seeing but it's

00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:52,860
not a perfect metric so it's something

00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:59,310
we should do more work on in the next

00:56:52,860 --> 00:57:01,170
year or so anybody here to studio

00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:06,690
experimenting with open cue using it at

00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:12,000
all it works more than experimenting so

00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:13,770
need a little bit networks as well cool

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,460
yeah I mean we did we did just so you

00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:19,800
guys know we did have to convert q3 into

00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,680
open Q so that was part of our process

00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,200
too so we had to go through converting

00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:28,650
it putting it on a Postgres database

00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:30,390
that sort of thing so it's yes that that

00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:35,060
process has obviously been started and

00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:35,060
established it's working well

00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:44,360
didn't check yeah yeah Luka was just

00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,250
saying the the way that we submit jobs

00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,400
has not changed so it's it's done the

00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:51,230
same way it's just there's obviously

00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,030
adaptations that Google and other people

00:57:51,230 --> 00:58:05,810
have made including the Postgres piece

00:57:53,030 --> 00:58:09,350
that we had to move to um on that note I

00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:10,580
think there this is a point of general

00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:12,820
interest for many of our projects

00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:15,620
perhaps open q in particular is to

00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,420
understand you know how widely use the

00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,070
component is it's very easy to tell when

00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,570
something becomes a component in a

00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:22,640
commercial software stack for example

00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:25,430
but much how when it's a you know

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,620
top-level application itself and that's

00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:30,760
something that has been raised as

00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:32,720
something that in one way or another

00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,550
some projects would like the foundation

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,790
to be able to help with it provider sort

00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:39,260
of an appropriate mechanism for studios

00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,120
and others to report their interest in

00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:51,250
use and support of a project so that

00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:57,080
that data is visible hey thank you Brian

00:58:51,250 --> 00:59:02,360
and now for open queue for openexr Gary

00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:04,850
Phillips that's right you're waiting on

00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,800
me I doubt there's anybody here that

00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:09,320
doesn't know what openexr is but just in

00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,350
case it's the high dynamic range image

00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:17,450
format that's standard in the industry

00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:20,360
and outside the industry anywhere high

00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:23,180
precision as is needed in an image

00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:25,760
format openexr as an old project it was

00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:29,150
originally developed in the early 2000s

00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,520
at ILM contributions from Wetty and

00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:36,560
dreamworks along the way more recent

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:39,650
history last may project joined the

00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:42,830
Software Foundation we formed the stair

00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:47,090
technical steering committee rallied an

00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:48,330
effort to deal with a bit of sort of

00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:51,890
deferred maintenance

00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:55,320
and technical debt made a 2.4 release

00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:58,740
just before SIGGRAPH last year finished

00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:03,510
off the CII badge and officially adopted

00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:06,810
in November it's worth pausing to ask

01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:09,060
how what what's expected of a project

01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:11,120
like this and openexr is not the kind of

01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:14,430
project that we really expect a

01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:16,670
tremendous amount of development and you

01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:18,930
know energy put into mostly it's just

01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:22,470
maintain it you know reliability

01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:24,930
stability and information about the

01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:27,650
project so that's kind of our operating

01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:33,510
assumptions for the goals of the project

01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:34,950
there's openexr is I guess probably the

01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:36,990
only foundation project that's widely

01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:39,560
used enough to have security

01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:42,480
vulnerabilities filed against it so

01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,920
we've dealt with some in the past and

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,600
have some more that we're working on now

01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,750
along with some other bug fixes and

01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:53,430
should have a release out imminently if

01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:56,030
not next week then soon there's another

01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:58,470
little batch of miscellaneous

01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,940
maintenance and small features and some

01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:03,600
improvements to threading that we hope

01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:06,000
to do sometime in the spring and we're

01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,850
tentatively targeting another release

01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,750
around SIGGRAPH in which we would

01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:12,000
deliver something that we've talked

01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:15,060
about of splitting the eye math library

01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,790
out from openexr and distributing it as

01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:20,670
its own project looking forward a little

01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:22,770
bit you know the things that kind of

01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:27,690
aren't on our immediate platform you

01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:30,960
know radar but we know are of concern to

01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:34,460
the industry around performance

01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,570
basically you know streaming performance

01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:38,760
one of the things we see as our

01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:41,130
responsibility in particular would be to

01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,540
provide a regression suite to measure

01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:47,340
performance we have nothing like that

01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:48,990
now so you know as we're fixing bugs we

01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:53,910
don't really know if it's as affecting

01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:58,350
performance or not another we've had

01:01:53,910 --> 01:02:02,030
several questions around the the format

01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:05,880
of the the definition of the file format

01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:08,540
people that might be interested in doing

01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,500
an alternative implementation of it

01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:12,000
not that that's something we're going to

01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,540
deal with but it's just an issue that's

01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,420
that's come up another thing that seems

01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:20,460
within our purview is to maintain a

01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:22,710
library of reference images just as

01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,090
educational purposes as well as

01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:29,300
benchmarks for the industry

01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:31,350
there isn't an opening sorry images repo

01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,800
nobody's paid much attention to it in a

01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:36,470
long time and I'm honestly not actually

01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:40,140
very familiar with what's there but

01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:43,200
revisiting that and and in that spirit

01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:46,980
updating the the website is one of the

01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:50,490
things that we're intending to invest

01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,800
time in you look at the period of time

01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:56,190
when we joined the software foundation

01:02:52,800 --> 01:03:00,540
to SIGGRAPH and then SIGGRAPH to hear

01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:04,020
you know kind of roughly similar pace of

01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:05,640
development or you know quantity of

01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:07,470
development except the time period is

01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:10,020
twice as much so kind of from that

01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:13,020
initial burst our activity is probably

01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,600
half now what it used to be and that

01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:17,400
kind of highlights one of what I'd put

01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,170
out there is sort of one of the

01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:23,940
challenges that I think our project

01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:26,520
faces you know like any kind of fragile

01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:29,550
ecosystem everything's fine until a

01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:32,630
storm comes along somebody goes on

01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:34,730
vacation and it feels like our level of

01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:37,800
responsiveness that we can muster

01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:40,800
suffers you know none of us involved

01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:42,960
with this do this as a core part of our

01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,370
day jobs where all this it's a side gig

01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,950
for everybody and we're just doing it

01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:50,520
because we enjoy it

01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:53,810
I wish that our pace of development was

01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:57,870
was faster and that we had a broader

01:03:53,810 --> 01:04:00,690
maintainer base Cristina Templar leads

01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:02,910
is on our steering committee she's there

01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:04,410
because I knew that she would be good

01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:07,650
and I just called her up and talked her

01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:10,650
into it and I think that's something we

01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,670
should just all resolve to do a better

01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:13,860
job of

01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:17,240
she's not an imaging expert but I'm not

01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:20,190
either and she's helped us out with our

01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:24,930
CI infrastructure and it's been it's

01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:27,390
been fantastic so check out more at the

01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:30,650
the repo in the website there's not a

01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:37,670
lot of activity on the the developer

01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:37,670
alias we meet regularly on Thursdays and

01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:46,520
write questions for Carrie you asked a

01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:50,250
question as part of your presentation

01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,880
what is expected of openexr moving

01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:55,650
forward

01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:57,240
it does does anyone have an answer was

01:04:55,650 --> 01:05:00,840
to venture an answer to that question is

01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:06,570
openexr just fine as it is or does

01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:13,710
anyone have ideas or suggestions for the

01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:15,540
group for the team moving forward you

01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,550
have a quick question which again and

01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:19,680
for this more for the room is that once

01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:21,240
you have pieces and then you have open

01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,920
choreo and then you have an archiving

01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:27,060
format is there a working group which is

01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,440
how the throughout of the three work

01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:30,390
together because again it's great to

01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,640
have the individual components but then

01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:36,240
what's the combination of the three

01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:38,760
things together in capture and archiving

01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:45,800
and and and work in DC cease to be a

01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:45,800
question I will defer to Larry on that

01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:57,180
question once you have what you mean

01:05:53,850 --> 01:06:00,080
sort of like you have the Monopoly game

01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:04,020
like you've gotten OCIO you have open XR

01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:07,110
and ASIS in this in this within this

01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:09,090
purview that that's great cuz now

01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:11,460
they're secure but then what would you

01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,730
do as a working group if you could steer

01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:21,360
all three at the same time for capture

01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:23,040
work in DCs and archiving I'm really on

01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,180
the spot now

01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,440
I'm just saying it was more of the

01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,910
question of like what would you do

01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,130
because I think with openexr

01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:30,840
it might be nothing but then the

01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:32,040
question of this group of why this group

01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,240
forms would be like what would you do

01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:35,460
once you get a few of these things

01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,350
together because explaining Asus to

01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:39,210
somebody and then we splitting them OCIO

01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:41,880
and then how it relates thee has always

01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:43,710
been challenging certainly ya know I you

01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,690
know I don't off the top of my head I

01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:48,780
don't have a good answer like I think

01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:51,630
that is what we figure out in the future

01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:54,750
but I I think all of them being under

01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:57,030
this umbrella at least leads to obvious

01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:59,700
coordination that would have been more

01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:01,470
awkward before well we don't we like we

01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,330
don't have a plan for what to do next on

01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,800
that particular topic I also think

01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:07,110
there's an opportunity here within the

01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:10,350
same way of like a us D working group

01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:12,930
you could imagine doing kind of a case

01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:15,270
study of if somebody you know some

01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:18,060
studio was willing to talk about on this

01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:19,680
feature this is what we did with these

01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:23,820
technologies Academy Software Foundation

01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:25,860
technologies and if there was some sort

01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,750
of template for them writing a bunch of

01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:29,550
notes about like the USD working group

01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:31,230
thing of like what would be some

01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:34,470
examples of things you could do but for

01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:35,880
color stuff that's a you know if you can

01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:37,680
get somebody be willing to be

01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,600
interviewed or be willing to sort of

01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,480
talk about it not saying this is best

01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:44,550
practice but saying this is what a

01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,020
studio did with it and we're happy with

01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:47,640
it or we're not happy with that anyway

01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:50,970
and I think I think that part of that

01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:54,120
will be overhauled and more clear as the

01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:56,580
OCIO v2 material gets rolled out and

01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:59,670
released because it's really it's a

01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:02,130
major reworking and I think it will

01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:04,290
cause people to rethink sort of what

01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:07,170
capabilities they're taking advantage of

01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:09,180
and how to build it into apps so we'll

01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:11,760
yeah I think it's part of it is just

01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:13,500
pending like how that ends up getting

01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,990
getting it but I think there's there's a

01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,520
value in kind of documenting the state

01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:19,470
of things versus this next one's gonna

01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,210
be so much better you know you could at

01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,740
least talk about like we here's why

01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:24,540
we're ending up doing that is because we

01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:27,060
did this on this one project we use this

01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:29,700
thing it were you know we had these this

01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:31,380
metadata in the openexr tags and that

01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,900
worked out super well we could just pull

01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:35,030
it out in JSON and we were done

01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:37,340
or things of like we try to do it this

01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:39,500
way and that didn't scale I think this

01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:42,500
has to be really driven primarily from

01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:45,500
on the studio side as a as a way that we

01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:47,180
think about how this had this media and

01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,880
metadata moves through the production

01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:52,520
space Netflix is super interested in

01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,890
this stuff we care a lot about it we're

01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,350
actively engaged in the production

01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:59,210
community around driving towards

01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:01,490
initiatives which align towards

01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:03,500
standardization around how color should

01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:05,390
work because it's a broad topic

01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,730
internationally as much as it is within

01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:09,080
the local community about what best

01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,940
practices can be in place to guarantee

01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,950
the the quality of the images that are

01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:17,300
coming out of the production space so I

01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:19,520
think our the group in are actually

01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,750
Michael is a part of CGI which is

01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,120
outwardly facing around how we've

01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:25,330
focused technology and drive it on the

01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,320
Prussian safe space and define

01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:29,030
standardization around our deliverables

01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,380
is very active in the space and has a

01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:33,020
couple of color scientists on their

01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:35,900
staff who are driving and participating

01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:38,890
both in OCIO and aces we're certainly

01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:42,740
interested a lot in not just the OCIO

01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:45,500
v2 but also sort of the next phase of of

01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:46,720
aces as a sort of a marker point where

01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,560
we can get a little bit more

01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:51,050
prescriptive about how we think about

01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,210
color and I think some coordination

01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:55,790
that's already existed across the

01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:57,200
universal group and others who in that

01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:59,570
community you are interested in in

01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,100
aligning the studio side around how this

01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,330
stuff should work will drive a lot of

01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,800
that conversation about how a working

01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:07,370
group would potentially sort of steer

01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,320
this package of of technology in a way

01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:12,710
that is most beneficial for them for the

01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:15,200
industry this is JC speaking a

01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:17,900
vice-chair of the Academy Asus project

01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:21,320
sitting on the outside until you let us

01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:23,510
into the inner circle here I had this

01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:28,280
arrest you know about the compression of

01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:30,380
EXR Peas zip or pick span will

01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,540
compression or is compression discussed

01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:34,880
in this inner group or do you leave it

01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:37,420
to outside vendors the compression of

01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,420
EXR

01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:48,380
we have compressions the the compression

01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:53,510
capabilities within the library now are

01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:57,170
implemented by dreamworks some years ago

01:10:53,510 --> 01:11:01,489
and i guess we consider our mission to

01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:03,290
maintain what's there and let me use

01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:06,110
this as a specific example if someone

01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:09,500
wanted to propose a new compression

01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:13,550
mechanism i think we would seriously

01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:15,170
consider it but you know as i've

01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:19,060
characterized the group we're not a

01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:21,500
bunch of people that kind of are

01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:24,170
necessarily looking for things to do

01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:25,940
ourselves it's more i guess we regard

01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:27,980
ourselves more as caretakers of the

01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:30,590
format to make sure that if somebody

01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:33,969
wants to undertake an initiative we

01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:36,260
should see that it's done properly but

01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:38,449
it's not really a topic of discussion

01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:42,730
within the group that we should should

01:11:38,449 --> 01:11:42,730
actively pursue something like that

01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:50,390
alright so there's something here to

01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:52,940
continue around openexr and dis

01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:56,390
synergies grace to your question between

01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:58,310
projects I was just gonna say that a big

01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:00,350
part of that part of the component of

01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:01,850
that is overlap between the groups you

01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:06,530
know Valeri is on the steering committee

01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:10,090
as is right bogart and from aces so at

01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:12,440
the very least people are talking

01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:15,080
synergies between the group this is

01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:20,449
something we will follow up on and now

01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:26,409
like to move on to open timeline IO Josh

01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:30,020
miner hey everybody I'm Josh miner and

01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:33,880
just lost power so I'm gonna try to see

01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:33,880
I can't see my slides but I'll carry on

01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:42,530
so I wanted to just talk a little bit

01:12:37,429 --> 01:12:44,000
about open timeline IO and one just sort

01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:47,840
of introduce the project since what is

01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:51,320
relatively new if we can go to the next

01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:53,180
slide okay so if in case you don't know

01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:56,360
what open timeline IO is

01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:58,940
it's an interchange format for dealing

01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,290
with editorial timelines so the types of

01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:02,420
things you would see in a video or audio

01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:04,880
editing things or clips and tracks and

01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:11,420
transitions that's one thing if you can

01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:12,980
go to the next slide we supply an API

01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:17,300
for working with those things both in

01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:19,670
Python and in C++ we have a file format

01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,690
for holding all that information about

01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,460
all those tracks and clips and

01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:25,850
everything and then we also have

01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:28,550
adapters for converting to and from a

01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:31,190
wide variety of other formats so that

01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:33,530
lets open timeline ao interoperate with

01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:36,650
things that already exist and files that

01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:39,680
already exist if we can go to the next

01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:41,660
slide and all those things are in

01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:44,570
service of building a flexible

01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:47,600
production pipeline and so at Pixar we

01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:51,920
use that in our pipeline to interoperate

01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:54,950
between avid media composer and the rest

01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,570
of our toolset so some of that same

01:13:54,950 --> 01:14:00,710
house tools some of that's third-party

01:13:56,570 --> 01:14:03,170
tools and that's been a really really

01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:04,910
great project for us that we have a

01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:08,930
tremendous amount of flexibility that we

01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:12,020
didn't have before and we chose to open

01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:13,460
source the project so that other studios

01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:16,430
other people could benefit from that but

01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:18,860
also so that we can get even more

01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:21,350
flexibility and support from other

01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:23,000
applications and other formats but that

01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:24,080
we don't already use and so we thought

01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,130
that that would be a really beneficial

01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:31,760
thing for for the industry you can go to

01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:35,570
the next slide so you know we looked at

01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,490
open sourcing and originally as a thing

01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:38,930
just to kind of reach out to the for the

01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:43,700
health side world and I think that was

01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:45,920
largely successful and then we looked

01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:49,070
into joining the Academy Software

01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:53,060
Foundation and really our goals there

01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:54,740
were around from getting awareness of

01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:57,560
the project in the industry and getting

01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:59,630
participation from from other folks

01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:02,390
especially from the sort of other

01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:03,830
software vendors so we can reached out

01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:06,020
to

01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:08,920
and an apple on a dough heating and the

01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:11,990
folks would make the sort of brand-name

01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,820
video editing software and gotten some

01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:16,940
response but not really a whole lot of

01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:18,560
engagement and definitely since our

01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:21,680
project joined the Academy Software

01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,870
Foundation and since we formed our

01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:26,180
technical steering committee we've had

01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:28,280
regular discussions and contributions

01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:31,130
from Netflix and from Autodesk

01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:33,290
DreamWorks storm studios and a few

01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:35,390
others and that's been a really really

01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:37,760
great because we I think successfully

01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:39,890
shifted to what I would consider a

01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:43,580
community driven roadmap rather than a

01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:45,290
Pixar driven one so we've achieved most

01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:47,900
of the goals of the things that we need

01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:51,140
it to to Pixar there's obviously loads

01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:54,080
of things we want to add and grow it but

01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:56,390
our core goal of the project is working

01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,070
really well for us and that means that

01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:00,280
we can be more flexible and open to

01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:03,010
contributions from other folks so

01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:05,900
Autodesk has proposed some changes

01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:08,540
actually Netflix and storm studio are

01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:09,800
collaborating on a improvement to the

01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:13,280
library so that's been really really

01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:16,310
good and we've also had more fruitful

01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:18,110
conversations with avid and other folks

01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:22,460
so I think that's been it's been really

01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:26,870
good we are going through a relatively

01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:29,900
small license changed and and Linux

01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:32,510
Foundation and a SWF have really helped

01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:35,930
us to sort of navigate that um that can

01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:37,280
be a sort of a tricky subject and some

01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:39,230
of us are not really used to sitting in

01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,880
rooms with lawyers and time talking

01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:43,580
about legal things but that's actually

01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,830
been a really good process so we're

01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:51,770
working on that you can go to the next

01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:55,790
slide so recently we have done a bunch

01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:58,490
of work to the project to put the sort

01:16:55,790 --> 01:17:01,100
of core pieces of it to C++ and this is

01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:03,970
in the hope that it can be easier to

01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:07,310
integrate with applications especially

01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:11,300
their party video editing applications

01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:14,780
or other just DC C's in general we've

01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:17,150
also improved our AF support and have it

01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:19,030
has given us some key sort of technical

01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:23,360
advice and helpful thought which has

01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:25,040
been really really helpful things that

01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,840
we never would have been able to figure

01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,940
out otherwise

01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,920
and also Autodesk has been helping was

01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:32,900
in Harvey supported doing code reviews

01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,110
and giving advice and things like that

01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:39,230
which was which was really football I

01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:42,140
mentioned a minute ago Netflix and storm

01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:43,730
studio are working on adding image

01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:47,890
sequence support so not just like video

01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:50,660
movie files but sequences of images and

01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:51,800
all those things are about to be

01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:55,550
released any minute now

01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:58,330
any day now and then in the future we

01:17:55,550 --> 01:18:01,190
have plans to improve our timing effects

01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:03,500
image effects these kinds of things to

01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:04,670
support all the other attributes that

01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,580
you might see in a video editing

01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:10,190
timeline as well as we're hoping to get

01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:12,350
more actually Native integrations with

01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:13,820
software rather than converting to and

01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:17,320
from file formats but actually have

01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:19,510
plugins and integrations with software

01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:21,920
the next slide please

01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:24,890
so if you want to find out more our

01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:27,980
website documentation our discussion

01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:30,260
group is not super chatty but we are

01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:32,590
about maybe 50 people on there the slack

01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:35,060
channel has about 60 people in there

01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:37,670
those are great ways to reach us and

01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:40,160
talk to us and I think we're

01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:42,530
specifically hoping to get engagement

01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:45,380
from people who really want to add in

01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:49,780
support you know we don't see support

01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:52,880
and you know you can flame and Maya and

01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:56,330
Reno and all the a sort of name-brand

01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,810
applications but you might want to get a

01:18:56,330 --> 01:19:02,090
timeline of clips in and out of

01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:04,820
especially where there's some features

01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:06,710
around those that but not really like a

01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:07,940
rich support for lots of metadata coming

01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:11,210
in and out so hope in time I could

01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:13,360
really helps to enrich that staple

01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:16,370
directions

01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:19,280
and yeah so I think that's a sort of

01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:22,450
main points I wanted to hit if you have

01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,450
questions I'm happy to answer them

01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:27,340
questions for Joshua and open Cameron I

01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:27,340
hope

01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,650
anything online now nobody on the line

01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,660
there are a few questions for past

01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:41,090
projects on the line I figured we'll get

01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:43,120
to those after open BTB if th everyone

01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:46,000
up together there that sounds great

01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:50,420
Thank You Josh for a get a great update

01:19:46,000 --> 01:20:00,290
appreciate it and now moving on to open

01:19:50,420 --> 01:20:03,170
V DB alright so for the ocean you that

01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:05,150
don't know remember when we DB is

01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:08,510
essentially three different things

01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:10,880
it's compact in-memory representations

01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:16,820
for volumes things like think fire smoke

01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:19,460
water it's also a light weight sensation

01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:21,830
auto call on the disk and it's a large

01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:26,630
full set of supporting tools for this

01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:28,430
data structure so one of the claims to

01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:30,800
fame for over MIDI BFS of cause it's

01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:33,050
commercial adoption there are a few new

01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:39,350
ones that came in this year in barium

01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:42,980
and blender we have a steering committee

01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:46,010
with four members I think that the big

01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:47,720
change this year is unfortunately Peter

01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:50,690
cooker who normally will represent

01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:54,970
DreamWorks had to take leave it's only

01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:59,720
if he's coming back and then I I left

01:20:54,970 --> 01:21:02,540
what as useful and joined Nvidia we meet

01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:04,730
at a regular cadence one one time a week

01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:08,840
every Thursday you're more than welcome

01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:14,750
to join we've had almost 40 meetings

01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:17,720
since we started late 2018 and all the

01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:21,860
minutes are online they can help people

01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:23,450
case you're interested I'd say I've

01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:26,720
characterized most of the activities

01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:29,360
that we had in 2019 as honestly

01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:33,320
bureaucracy we spend a lot of time

01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:36,820
documenting processes report a ton of

01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:40,340
time into a new build system see make

01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:42,590
and then we simplified licenses

01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:45,050
talk a lot about security and in between

01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:47,450
all of that we have time for three

01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:49,430
releases two major releases so I make it

01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:53,990
release is typically when we change the

01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:56,990
ABI of the grid not the tools and then

01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:59,180
we've had new external collaborations

01:21:56,990 --> 01:22:01,490
we're working with a by first team from

01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:04,190
Autodesk we're talking about potentially

01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:07,700
adopting their multi-resolution grip

01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:09,620
very using which is very exciting and

01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:12,170
then of course this is even before I

01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:14,270
joined Nvidia we're talking to Nvidia so

01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:16,610
Nvidia of course is interested in in

01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:19,910
trying to take some of these ideas from

01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:22,400
technologies to the GPU and I'm involved

01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:24,050
in this as well at this point so and I

01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,120
think the highlight last year obviously

01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:30,860
was that we were the first project to

01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:34,520
graduate this is a list of projects that

01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:36,940
we hope to accomplish in 2020 I think

01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:40,000
that the biggest the biggest

01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:41,720
contribution is from Dean X it's this

01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,800
scripting language just-in-time

01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:46,880
compilation language called ax but there

01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,410
are also a number of other things that

01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:51,130
you can see on this list there faster

01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:54,880
level set tools the sharpening

01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:58,130
improvements to the point support

01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,110
there's also the idea so currently today

01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:02,180
VB supports what's called delayed

01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:04,580
loading so lazy loading data is only

01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:06,410
loaded as you touch it the problem is in

01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:07,910
the context of rendering if your

01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:09,890
renderer touches everything the

01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:14,540
high-water mark is essentially the whole

01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:16,460
thing so I've been working on the idea

01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:18,800
of evicting pages again so you can

01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:22,820
actually up front specify the maximum

01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:24,320
memory footprint let's see there's also

01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:27,290
yes it said before are we really

01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:31,160
exploring the GPU as acceleration

01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:32,630
platform and then one of the things that

01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:35,000
I'm mostly excited about is actually a

01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:38,510
contribution from from Autodesk if that

01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,250
will work out would be super cool yeah

01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:43,940
in case you want to get involved here

01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:47,210
are some links I also had a few a list

01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:49,310
of what I called challenges so as I said

01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:51,620
we spend a lot of time maintaining the

01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:53,939
see make and in particular window

01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:56,309
support is very painful for us

01:23:53,939 --> 01:23:58,289
both because the CI doesn't really

01:23:56,309 --> 01:24:00,300
support Windows but also because we

01:23:58,289 --> 01:24:02,309
don't have a lot of expertise on the TSC

01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:08,209
so if any of you are interested in this

01:24:02,309 --> 01:24:08,209
please please reach out yeah

01:24:09,379 --> 01:24:28,109
all right questions for open V DB and/or

01:24:21,409 --> 01:24:30,329
all the projects we have two in the game

01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:32,039
over here well actually no we have an

01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:35,159
open V DB questions let me hit that

01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:37,289
first before Ken runs away the question

01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:39,929
is how has it been getting projects to

01:24:37,289 --> 01:24:44,340
adopt newer versions of open V DB and

01:24:39,929 --> 01:24:45,030
its ABI changes I'm not sure I

01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:47,340
understand that question

01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:48,570
how is it different from I think how

01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,209
does it how has it been going like

01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:53,669
what's been the uptake of getting you

01:24:51,209 --> 01:24:55,859
know new adoption on newer versions of

01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:57,090
open V DB and the various API changes

01:24:55,859 --> 01:24:58,590
that have happened like you're seeing

01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:01,229
people moving over to the new versions

01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:03,510
or it's traditionally it's it's quite

01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:04,709
slow it looks like most of the

01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:09,510
commercial packages are about a year

01:25:04,709 --> 01:25:13,909
behind but yeah other than that has been

01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:13,909
pretty smooth not a big change there I

01:25:15,079 --> 01:25:23,369
think that's the only it's the only one

01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:27,689
we have for open DVD II I'm gonna roll

01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:30,510
back here a little bit there's a

01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:33,059
question I believe from open queue for

01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:35,280
open queue has the open cube project

01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:44,129
looked at working with online farm

01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:46,349
vendors for spreading the project you

01:25:44,129 --> 01:25:49,590
repeat that I'm sorry yes are you tom

01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:52,649
has the open queue project looked at

01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:57,030
working with online farm vendors for

01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:58,739
spreading the project I'm sure I

01:25:57,030 --> 01:26:01,739
understand I like online farm Benner's

01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:04,939
is think of it like just like cloud

01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:04,939
render farm kind of things

01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:14,499
yeah no we haven't done any of that yet

01:26:09,969 --> 01:26:16,889
but we are kind of like we are looking

01:26:14,499 --> 01:26:19,630
at ways that we could kind of merge

01:26:16,889 --> 01:26:21,340
merge opq with other cloud environments

01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:23,349
and then you know not only make it you

01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:25,179
know we have good good representation

01:26:23,349 --> 01:26:27,939
from all the major cloud providers on

01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:28,989
the TSC so we're definitely trying to

01:26:27,939 --> 01:26:31,809
make it as cloud friendly as possible

01:26:28,989 --> 01:26:33,639
and it is hybrid friendly as possible so

01:26:31,809 --> 01:26:35,820
yeah it's something that will probably

01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:40,090
look at more in the future

01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:43,449
and we have one this is a USD related

01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:45,760
question it's I don't have first-hand

01:26:43,449 --> 01:26:48,130
experience but understand that

01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,989
interoperability of USD between

01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:52,360
facilities is difficult

01:26:49,989 --> 01:26:58,360
well the pics are working group address

01:26:52,360 --> 01:27:01,989
and wrap issues I would say hold that

01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:04,689
question for the working group question

01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:06,610
that we're going to address here on

01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:09,429
specifically you as the we have will

01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:14,260
have time in the discussion time for our

01:27:09,429 --> 01:27:15,899
USD and there's one more around gaps in

01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:18,909
the landscape for open source software

01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:21,639
it was about the whole overview are

01:27:18,909 --> 01:27:23,289
there in your opinion major graphs and

01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:25,260
the current landscape of open source

01:27:23,289 --> 01:27:28,119
software for the motion picture industry

01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:30,219
is it a goal of the a SWF to somehow

01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:33,179
think about it I don't know if this is

01:27:30,219 --> 01:27:37,300
getting into your next section as well I

01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:40,630
can speak somewhat to that obviously

01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:43,169
that's something that changes and

01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:45,429
evolves over time and this audience is

01:27:43,169 --> 01:27:47,979
in a very good position to actually help

01:27:45,429 --> 01:27:49,419
us define or identify those areas in

01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:51,479
general you know we can think about

01:27:49,419 --> 01:27:53,860
those gaps in a number of different ways

01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:56,499
in some cases it's because you know a

01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:58,329
new technology space has opened up and

01:27:56,499 --> 01:28:00,760
they're simply you know no projects it

01:27:58,329 --> 01:28:02,590
has started to move in to it in other

01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:03,939
cases it's because you know a particular

01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:06,459
set of technologies is close to becoming

01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:08,139
a commodity you know we may all have

01:28:06,459 --> 01:28:09,550
proprietary solutions and that's not

01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:11,469
something we see value in maintaining

01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:13,209
and similarly the same can apply to

01:28:11,469 --> 01:28:14,530
something that you know for which there

01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:16,360
are commercial solutions which for

01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:17,890
whatever reason don't necessarily make

01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:21,310
sense in a commercial space

01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:24,940
so it's it is definitely part of our

01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:27,730
mandate to be a space for those

01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:30,010
conversations to occur and I think

01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:31,210
membership has been very active in

01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,200
actually identifying some of those

01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:35,320
opportunities

01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:37,870
we did have some specific suggestions

01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:40,120
from our last round of member surveys

01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:44,710
and I think we'll talk about those in

01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:48,360
the in the next section that catches us

01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:51,340
up in the chat okay

01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:54,930
so last chance for questions about the

01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:58,110
projects I think we got a great yes I

01:28:54,930 --> 01:29:00,310
just kinda have a general question I'm I

01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:02,020
first of all I think it's remarkable

01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:04,330
where the foundation is after one year

01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:06,490
and so just hats off to everybody who's

01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:08,740
helped lead this and all the committee's

01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:10,150
I mean it's it's it's quite amazing very

01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:16,450
impressive thank you to everyone the

01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:17,980
members it's almost almost can't imagine

01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:20,890
it now not existing it's only been

01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:22,540
around for a year so it's very cool my

01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:23,980
question was about and this was touched

01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:26,320
on a little bit by some of the project

01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:28,660
updates was wondering about like how we

01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:31,270
feel like is there we're getting the

01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:32,830
amount of engineering support and an

01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:34,900
investment that we were kind of hoping

01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:36,700
for with the projects that we have thus

01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,880
far in other words you mentioned that

01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:41,890
we've got 23 members now contributing

01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,720
money and I don't know how much of that

01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:45,700
translates into actual engineering to

01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:48,070
support the different projects how much

01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:49,900
we're getting also the kind of the the

01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:51,760
FTE equivalent contribution from the

01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,840
different members I just kind of Kerry's

01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,310
like what the general feeling is like

01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:56,590
are we getting the kind of engineering

01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:57,700
support and boost from the foundation

01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:59,290
for these projects that we were

01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:03,130
expecting I know it's it's kind of early

01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:05,650
still in the process but canaries good

01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:08,020
question any answers from the group

01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:12,610
speaking speaking from Oban BTB I would

01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:15,700
say absolutely alright just having any

01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:21,220
attention and open the XRS the benefit

01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:25,360
of this right so I I have a comment

01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:27,370
because I want to echo what what Steve

01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:29,530
said I think it's pretty amazing what's

01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:30,700
been accomplished in the foundation so

01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:32,920
far

01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:35,980
a lot of it has been a transition to

01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:38,410
some commonality and stewardship and a

01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:42,960
bunch of other things I really believe

01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:45,910
that when we transition to when the FTE

01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:49,500
equivalents are applied to the projects

01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:53,410
in the foundation as opposed to just any

01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:56,770
open source project that I think that

01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:59,590
that is for me a major part of what I

01:30:56,770 --> 01:31:01,600
think their discussion should have

01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:03,880
because I think that will change the

01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,100
nature of stuff I think people who are

01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,800
contributing at the higher level of

01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:11,560
putting the dollars forward will be able

01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:14,230
to see value back for what it is that

01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:16,930
they're doing and there's more of a

01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:21,880
direct correlation so I think that the

01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:24,760
focus on the FTE and seeing return from

01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:27,550
that is really going to be centered

01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:30,220
around when we can make that transition

01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:32,370
and that's I was going to bring up a

01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:35,200
little later as I think that that's

01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:38,560
something that the foundation needs to

01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:40,930
be talking about maybe not solving here

01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:44,530
but as part of the governing or the tax

01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:48,730
or the other activities that has to

01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:52,180
occur before people start losing

01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:54,790
momentum over some of that I I just want

01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:57,040
to add that I agree that it will be

01:31:54,790 --> 01:32:00,250
great like right now I think we don't

01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:04,450
have any metric on whether the members

01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,860
are putting the FTEs in at all I mean we

01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:07,630
can see that a lot of them are but like

01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:10,540
there's no it's not recorded anywhere

01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:12,730
but I'm less concerned about what you

01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:16,780
just mentioned about the in project

01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:20,260
project because as far as I know like I

01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:22,690
haven't come across anyone who said we

01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:25,060
are doing our FTE but in a non-work

01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:27,340
project like I don't know any instance

01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:30,880
of someone claiming that they're putting

01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:32,260
their FTE outside so I like I don't know

01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,020
if that'll be a major transition or not

01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:36,940
on the USD or Alembic or stuff like that

01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:39,880
are they counting that's where do they

01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:41,500
claim that that's their FTE we've never

01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:43,180
lost the question to be honest I mean I

01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,840
think that except in the case of the

01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:47,560
server

01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:49,270
that we ran recently and a couple of

01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:51,340
people did actually suggest projects

01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:53,050
that were sort of out of a cool set but

01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:55,389
at the same time is I think everyone has

01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:56,920
noted we haven't I think the discussions

01:32:55,389 --> 01:32:58,179
around this particularly at the time

01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,670
when we didn't have a significant number

01:32:58,179 --> 01:33:02,650
of projects obviously didn't create a

01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:04,929
tight exclusion on what it was that

01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:07,960
activity it was never time to do it

01:33:04,929 --> 01:33:10,270
before now and it may not be now but

01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,489
part of both the value question for

01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:14,230
people who take the risk of putting

01:33:12,489 --> 01:33:16,599
their project that's near and dear to

01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:20,199
their heart into the foundation and

01:33:16,599 --> 01:33:22,780
people who are putting up the funding to

01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:24,730
be able to correlate some of that a

01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:28,330
little bit together I think is going to

01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:31,420
be a critical part of the next phase of

01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:33,580
evolution of this group not detracting

01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:37,119
from everything that has been done it's

01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:38,980
just it's phenomenal I mean like Steve

01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:42,310
says it's hard to imagine that this

01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:43,300
hasn't always been here and maybe

01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:46,239
there's a little bit of lead time for

01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:49,719
that transition because again it's you

01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:51,070
know people are putting the resources on

01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:53,139
things they care about but if there is a

01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:55,989
transition to hey it's a full-time

01:33:53,139 --> 01:33:58,510
engineer and that engineer will be there

01:33:55,989 --> 01:34:00,219
job will be to work here just I guess

01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:03,099
would just be like hey that's a goal for

01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:04,840
a year and then people will need warning

01:34:03,099 --> 01:34:07,929
for it that's it that's why I'm saying

01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:11,199
it needs to it there needs to be a clear

01:34:07,929 --> 01:34:16,330
path to this however and whenever you do

01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:18,670
it in the case of only openexr it's kind

01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:19,920
of an example of getting the band back

01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:23,260
together again

01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:26,530
just calling up the people and talking

01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:29,560
to Minda going on tour I think what we

01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:31,389
what we haven't been successful at I

01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:33,849
don't have much of a mechanism of doing

01:34:31,389 --> 01:34:35,770
is identifying a chunk of work that

01:34:33,849 --> 01:34:37,750
needs to be done that we don't have the

01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:40,540
capacity of doing and going out and

01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:41,980
seeking somebody to do it exactly I

01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:44,290
think that's one my bigger question goes

01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:45,909
to is like what what is our capacity to

01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:48,340
as we as we look forward like what is

01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:49,750
our capacity to adopt new projects do we

01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:52,150
actually have enough resources for the

01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:54,400
projects that we currently have I know

01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:56,409
we want to we want to do more but I also

01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,220
want to ensure that like the projects

01:34:56,409 --> 01:34:59,980
that we have are six

01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:02,160
and thrive before I don't know we get

01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:06,130
too far ahead of ourselves

01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:08,260
yeah to Chris's point I we never thought

01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:09,970
of one ft is a single person committed

01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:11,260
to this because the expertise of the

01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:13,180
virus projects lies at different

01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:14,320
individuals it's more that you know

01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,640
there's two months of this guy in three

01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:19,330
months of that girl and what-have-you

01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:21,070
right and so it's a it's can become

01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:23,200
nuanced when you start and think of it

01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:25,360
that way I have a team of 200 and you

01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:27,030
know there's a few weeks of this person

01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:29,230
and seven weeks at that person had

01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:30,940
frosting is the best way to do it I get

01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:34,300
it provides the most value to the to the

01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:37,660
virus endeavors and then then the other

01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:40,240
thing to mention is just that aside the

01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:43,060
FTE commitment from from the premiere

01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:45,100
members there's there's a large budget

01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:48,040
there's funds that are being committed

01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:51,250
by by premiere and general members alike

01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:54,160
and those don't all go to just funding

01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:57,880
these meetings and chairs and tables and

01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:59,740
stuff like that yeah but they also can

01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:00,880
go start to go to and I think that's one

01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:02,740
of the things that we'll be focusing on

01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,870
in terms of developer engagement this

01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:06,220
year they can also go to funding some of

01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:07,540
those things that are here's this

01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:09,670
project in order to get this project

01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:11,470
over into Academy Software Foundation

01:36:09,670 --> 01:36:13,810
this is the kind of help the support

01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:15,340
that they need that they look for in

01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:18,010
order to do that and that's a reason to

01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:22,930
pull them in that's I think that's

01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:25,660
exactly what we're here to do so I have

01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:30,550
a couple of comments to make one is that

01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:34,090
I was struck by the fact that I think in

01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:37,930
the survey results openexr figured as

01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:40,720
the project that was apparently most you

01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:44,260
know the most common target of people's

01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:46,750
self-reported you know FTE contributions

01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:48,910
but at the same time it was also a

01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:51,610
project where Kerry called out the fact

01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:53,020
that you know he feels in some ways the

01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:54,700
lack of that engagement and perhaps that

01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:57,880
speaks to the difference between a more

01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,050
diffused that have no where they were

01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:02,470
involved but we're not necessarily

01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:04,180
actually commutable as a resource that

01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:07,480
we were discussing in that in that

01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:09,010
conversation the other just sort of

01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:11,340
follows that through I think it is very

01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:13,840
important that we work out

01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:16,749
ourselves how we're going to try and you

01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:18,729
know make these transitions or make best

01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:20,380
use of the commitments that we have but

01:37:18,729 --> 01:37:23,050
I suspect that this is something that

01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:25,030
arises in all of the communities and

01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:27,010
foundations that the Linux Foundation is

01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:29,679
has dealt with so I'm very interested to

01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:33,669
sort of hear what experiences we may be

01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:36,519
able to learn from that's where I come

01:37:33,669 --> 01:37:38,800
up with an answer right yeah I mean this

01:37:36,519 --> 01:37:42,039
is this is a common thing you know

01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:44,199
projects can only really move as fast as

01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:47,860
the contributors and committers allow

01:37:44,199 --> 01:37:49,630
them to I think there's certainly a

01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:51,999
number of different aspects of things

01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:54,880
that I think that the first set is just

01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:56,619
setting a level set one of the things we

01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,729
started doing with all of these projects

01:37:56,619 --> 01:38:00,189
earlier this year

01:37:57,729 --> 01:38:03,010
is putting one of our new tools called

01:38:00,189 --> 01:38:04,209
dev analytics on each of the projects

01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:06,369
because we wanted to answer the first

01:38:04,209 --> 01:38:08,050
question of what does the diversity look

01:38:06,369 --> 01:38:11,260
like in each project from a contributor

01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:13,239
standpoint because what we see is a

01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:14,199
healthy sustainable project is if any

01:38:13,239 --> 01:38:16,570
one of the major organizations

01:38:14,199 --> 01:38:18,880
contributing can walk away and the

01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:20,880
project can continue on so if all is so

01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,659
if we look at an open VDB and

01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,159
three-quarters of the contributors are

01:38:22,659 --> 01:38:27,280
from Dreamworks that's not very

01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:29,829
sustainable but if one third are then

01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:32,039
that is sustainable and especially if

01:38:29,829 --> 01:38:34,539
that's a growing amount over time so

01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:36,699
we're combining this with also looking

01:38:34,539 --> 01:38:38,800
at you know sort of different

01:38:36,699 --> 01:38:41,199
methodologies such as just sort of like

01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,340
what's the economic value to recreate

01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:43,840
some of this I've done some early

01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:46,899
analysis is that that I want to

01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,849
hopefully share with attack some but I

01:38:46,899 --> 01:38:50,289
think it all hones back into that same

01:38:48,849 --> 01:38:53,260
sort of thing of you know I think

01:38:50,289 --> 01:38:56,050
there's one question here of how can we

01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:57,550
assess what's sort of the FTE or

01:38:56,050 --> 01:39:01,689
whatever the contribution for

01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:05,260
organizations looks like and then on the

01:39:01,689 --> 01:39:07,630
second of how can we grow that time or

01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:09,729
and assess whether are we meeting the

01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:13,479
demands that the project needs for

01:39:09,729 --> 01:39:14,829
growth or we behind the curve so more to

01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:17,530
come there but I think we're starting at

01:39:14,829 --> 01:39:19,269
the analysis point and I would say we

01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:21,399
did ask in our members survey about

01:39:19,269 --> 01:39:23,110
where the FTEs were going it was a

01:39:21,399 --> 01:39:24,969
fairly even split across the five

01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:26,829
projects and for people who were

01:39:24,969 --> 01:39:28,659
contributing to other projects like USD

01:39:26,829 --> 01:39:31,360
they were still also putting resources

01:39:28,659 --> 01:39:32,710
into our project so it wasn't like I

01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:35,260
don't think we have any one member who's

01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:37,110
putting their FTEs towards completely

01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:39,999
towards a project outside the foundation

01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:42,729
so you know the big ones hobbies are

01:39:39,999 --> 01:39:45,190
coming up being USD

01:39:42,729 --> 01:39:46,869
I think there's small also some evidence

01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:48,400
of people not contributing to a specific

01:39:46,869 --> 01:39:50,260
project but - that's the ICD

01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:52,389
infrastructure like we heard jf called

01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:53,889
out earlier today and certainly we've

01:39:52,389 --> 01:39:56,920
done that our fair share of that on the

01:39:53,889 --> 01:39:58,690
Animal Logic side contributions mean a

01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,469
lot of different things to projects one

01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:02,349
is writing code

01:39:59,469 --> 01:40:04,119
another is writing documentation another

01:40:02,349 --> 01:40:06,550
is helping coordinate efforts and

01:40:04,119 --> 01:40:08,590
infrastructure there's all sorts of

01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:15,400
expertise is to make this successful so

01:40:08,590 --> 01:40:17,590
also there's things yeah exactly exactly

01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:19,840
and it's a hard question that every

01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:20,949
project out there tries to wrap their

01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,630
head around and that's something that

01:40:20,949 --> 01:40:24,070
we're looking to spend more time and get

01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:25,570
the right data points so we can assess

01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:28,389
that for these projects going forward

01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:29,800
yeah and it was a super useful coal I

01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:31,900
forget a couple months ago about use

01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:34,300
cases and deployment scenarios and

01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:36,760
examples that all of this projects that

01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:38,320
are relied on and again that you know

01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,940
you gotta remember that these are

01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,229
contributions and it takes time to put

01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:42,639
them together correctly and have

01:40:41,229 --> 01:40:44,769
examples that are relevant to people

01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:47,050
like it's it's no easy I think it's

01:40:44,769 --> 01:40:48,579
harder than dogs to be honest good

01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:50,170
examples I have true examples it's easy

01:40:48,579 --> 01:40:52,030
but have examples are useful to people

01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:54,849
it's actually very hard yeah there's

01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:56,679
also those of us at companies that have

01:40:54,849 --> 01:40:58,659
large legal departments and want to make

01:40:56,679 --> 01:41:00,340
sure that work that you've already done

01:40:58,659 --> 01:41:02,559
that you want to contribute you need to

01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:08,170
you know run it through a lot of things

01:41:02,559 --> 01:41:09,880
so just saying this is why we've spent a

01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:12,429
lot of time with the projects and

01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,409
licensing over the past year I think you

01:41:12,429 --> 01:41:17,289
saw little dabbles of that in some of

01:41:14,409 --> 01:41:19,840
the slides and I applaud the TSE

01:41:17,289 --> 01:41:21,969
chairpersons who attempted to talk to

01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:24,309
vex I know it's not a native thing but

01:41:21,969 --> 01:41:25,749
you know I think as this foundation was

01:41:24,309 --> 01:41:28,119
founded that was one of the big goals

01:41:25,749 --> 01:41:29,920
having a common contribution framework

01:41:28,119 --> 01:41:32,139
especially having people on common

01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,880
licenses and especially OSI compliant

01:41:32,139 --> 01:41:36,550
ones so you're not having to go to your

01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:37,840
lawyers and explain to them why is this

01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:38,620
weird license coming up that you've

01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,800
never heard of

01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:44,560
that you're trying to contribute to yeah

01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:46,420
a lot of work has been done that doesn't

01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:50,460
necessarily mean that it has been shared

01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:54,090
yet exactly where there can be exactly

01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:58,900
we're not finished we're just starting

01:41:54,090 --> 01:42:00,490
that's this it's a great line of

01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:03,760
discussion it's the core of what we do

01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:11,830
so we want that content that discussion

01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:13,530
to continue here or after the fact in

01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:16,600
terms of our looking forward discussion

01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:19,630
here these are proposed topics in the

01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:22,750
last 45 minutes that we have for

01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:25,960
discussions that we that I'd like to

01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:29,470
bring up and we'll also have at the end

01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:34,690
a general ready we miss questions in

01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:36,700
terms of topics so moving on on the

01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:38,470
first one with regards to survey we

01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:43,600
mentioned that we surveyed ourselves in

01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:47,530
a number of ways and there is a proposal

01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:50,440
for a survey from Nick Cannon that I

01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:53,380
would like him to talk about here give

01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:56,470
us a brief description from the ves VFX

01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:58,150
reference platform point of view yeah

01:42:56,470 --> 01:43:00,970
thank you David yeah and then this is

01:42:58,150 --> 01:43:05,320
really an early idea so it's but it's

01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:07,390
driven primarily by two things one is we

01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:08,890
hope to make some more changes to the

01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:11,080
VEX reference platform this year with a

01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:12,930
focus on broadening support from Linux

01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:16,390
to other major operating systems as well

01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:18,900
and we're also seeing you know vendors

01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:23,500
and software providers making decisions

01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:26,020
based on incomplete market data and you

01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:29,800
know Linux is still a very important

01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:30,940
platform for this industry and we need

01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,980
to make sure that we're advocating for

01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:35,440
that and people understand the size the

01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:38,530
importance of that market as well as the

01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:41,010
growing Mac and Windows base as well in

01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:44,220
some o studios so the ideal would be to

01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:49,240
go out and do a more of a studio survey

01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:51,040
and try and collect some comprehensive

01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,890
information without making the survey so

01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,230
long that everyone

01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:57,980
turned off doing it to try and encourage

01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:59,300
people to participate we would anonymize

01:43:57,980 --> 01:44:01,250
or actually act with we don't use

01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:04,250
released we'd guarantee confidentiality

01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:06,230
and just report our aggregate data and

01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:09,400
the kind of things we're thinking of of

01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:11,330
collecting a operating system versions

01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,760
what do you want currently what do you

01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:17,300
plan to move to over the next year or

01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:19,130
two window manager specifically on linux

01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:21,380
is is a thing what we're starting to see

01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:24,680
is that the we haven't been getting

01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:27,050
premium drivers or Linux because vendors

01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:28,610
are confused by all the windows managers

01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:31,310
in use and so they think it's it's it's

01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:33,800
not worth effort try and do premium

01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:35,590
drivers on that platform and we think we

01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:38,540
can be can be consuella them otherwise

01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:41,540
so a number of hosts of different OSS

01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:43,850
and memory size and render farm size

01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:45,890
splitting cloud and on prime

01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:47,840
the we have a whole list and probably

01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:49,850
can't do it can't do everything but

01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:51,830
we've been but but the idea is you know

01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:53,510
it's is they do we think it's an

01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:55,100
interesting thing worth doing certainly

01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:56,480
from a VFX reference platform via state

01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:58,940
committee we think would be valuable

01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:01,520
data to share openly with across the

01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:02,630
industry of course studios and i meant

01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,580
some providers and we do this in

01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:06,500
conjunction with having software

01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:09,290
foundation to give it some increased

01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:11,000
credibility and reach and and as well

01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:13,640
and maybe if successful is something we

01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,970
could do every year or to try and get a

01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:18,200
picture of how the market is evolving

01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:21,140
and how the infrastructure and platform

01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:22,760
is evolving over time so that from a

01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:23,780
again from having software pack

01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:25,220
foundation perspective for all the

01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:27,050
projects they know what they're trying

01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:28,730
to target and run a better understanding

01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:29,960
of what where the studios are going so

01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:34,250
they can target their the software more

01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:36,170
appropriately those are some of the

01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:37,790
ideas like who grabbed me offers I can

01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:38,870
or my specifics about some specific

01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:42,950
examples of why we think is good

01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:44,990
beneficial so as a general statement the

01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:47,120
Academy Software Foundation will would

01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:49,640
very much would be glad to team up with

01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:52,010
the VES reference platform the FX

01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:54,770
reference platform to to do a survey

01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:56,270
like that and if we if we think

01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:59,300
collectively that it's a good thing to

01:45:56,270 --> 01:46:02,060
do and that would be a question for the

01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:05,330
group and in terms of what Nick

01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:07,070
mentioned also contribution of are there

01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:10,330
this may be the opportunity to as a

01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:14,450
studio a number of important questions

01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:17,570
if there are other data point that you

01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:20,240
think would be useful would be Glade

01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:24,770
we'll be glad to engage with with your

01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:26,090
group Nick to to make a joint survey

01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:28,250
okay thank you

01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:30,650
yeah I'd encourage you also to include

01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:31,700
the products under the committee here to

01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:34,250
see what version they're actually

01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:35,570
running yeah that's a good idea actual

01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:37,880
software versions what are they using my

01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:39,230
plan sees right I would say this yeah

01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:41,300
this is an excellent opportunity to try

01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:43,010
and meet that other question that we

01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:45,710
heard about which was studio uptake of

01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:49,970
some of our open source components to

01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:52,130
potentially right we anticipate making

01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:53,600
this something that we could attempt to

01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,670
repeat over time it sounds like this

01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,840
would actually be you know no III think

01:46:55,670 --> 01:46:58,520
of all the value and this is seeing

01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:59,570
trends over time so I think if we can

01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:03,530
get it right and have some consistency

01:46:59,570 --> 01:47:11,660
year-on-year then yeah useful okay so

01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:14,840
we'll take that on diversity and

01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:18,610
inclusion we talked a lot about that

01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:22,450
topic and we know that we have to to

01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:24,740
transform moving forward our our

01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:26,270
demographic that's called it that way at

01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:31,790
the foundation here and in the group

01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:35,240
around the table I have a this is a poll

01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:38,090
here in a general question some of you

01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:39,800
have experienced or than others and how

01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:43,760
to improve diversity in your

01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:47,240
organization so this is a poll if you

01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:52,930
take your phones and log again you will

01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:55,970
see these four pre pre written

01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:58,880
suggestions in terms of how we can

01:47:55,970 --> 01:48:02,210
improve diversity on this poll you can

01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:04,610
vote for the each one of the item that

01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:08,420
is there move it up move it down and you

01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:11,510
can also type new ones so if once you're

01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:13,850
there if you can write these four points

01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:18,880
and and if you have further ideas about

01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:18,880
diversity please feel free to

01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:27,570
to add them and as we're doing that if

01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:31,160
you also have some success stories that

01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:34,410
you would like to share with us in any

01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:37,440
any program or any actions that you took

01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:39,030
that brought diversity to your

01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:42,170
organization that would be the time to

01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:42,170
share with the group

01:48:53,180 --> 01:49:00,570
no one has suggestions I'm going to put

01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:02,160
someone on the spot I'll speak up and

01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:04,260
say I think one of the challenges we've

01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:05,820
had so far in terms of identifying

01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:07,350
people I mean I see the mentorship

01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:09,780
program is getting really high up there

01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:10,980
are and I love that idea the problem is

01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:13,590
is that we don't have anybody right now

01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:16,170
to be the mentors so I mean we haven't

01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:17,670
even identified them in terms of you

01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:19,320
know gender especially we haven't

01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:21,690
identified that many women within the

01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:22,680
foundation and I think one of the

01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:25,290
promises I think there are a lot more

01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:26,760
women and other diverse you know people

01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:29,280
working on the projects but because we

01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:31,320
only have one person interfacing on the

01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:33,570
tack a lot of times we don't even know

01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:36,390
who those people are so even having our

01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:38,520
own members just say hey these are the

01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:40,590
people on my team internally who are

01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:42,330
working on the project that could be

01:49:40,590 --> 01:49:44,730
potentially good to highlight on the

01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:46,590
website or be involved in things I think

01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:47,970
would be good or you know any even

01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:49,830
outside of our members as well I think

01:49:47,970 --> 01:49:51,270
sometimes people are just so buried

01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:53,190
within their organizations it's hard to

01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:55,050
find them I do think if you want to do

01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:57,900
mentorship I mean this is we've had this

01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:59,520
conversation before about you know in my

01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:01,410
particular case reaching inside my

01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,810
company to get people to come up this

01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:05,970
and there's a big time commitment to be

01:50:03,810 --> 01:50:08,730
involved with this but there are I mean

01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:10,470
I can think of five you know people of

01:50:08,730 --> 01:50:12,450
different genders than me that I could

01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:13,920
reach out to immediately inside the

01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:15,300
organization saying would you you know

01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,280
you're a software developer would you be

01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:19,620
willing to mentor someone in this and

01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:21,510
maybe you know I probably get one or two

01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:22,860
who would do that so I'm not necessarily

01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:24,660
the mentor I'm not to say the right

01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:26,490
person that you want to be the mentor if

01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:27,900
we're especially if we're trying to do

01:50:26,490 --> 01:50:30,030
it in this way but for people who want

01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:32,340
to see themselves in something

01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:35,340
imagine most of us could ask other

01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:37,320
people in their organization that that

01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:39,090
either are unable or unwilling to do the

01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:40,980
commitment to be on the tack or to be on

01:50:39,090 --> 01:50:46,260
whatever but they might be willing to be

01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:49,020
a mentor or just a contributor to the

01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:51,510
projects yes I mean we I've met you yeah

01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:53,280
absolutely one of our Studios has just

01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:54,869
to keep using gender as the example but

01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:58,380
it's not the only one has a bunch of

01:50:54,869 --> 01:51:00,960
talented women developers but like those

01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:02,730
aren't necessarily the people who have

01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,650
had their fingers in the open-source

01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:06,780
projects but they could be recruited to

01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:07,920
do so if it was important you know I was

01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:09,719
just speaking specifically to the

01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,030
mentorship thing yeah we don't have to

01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:15,840
be the mentors we can go find mentors in

01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:17,489
our company when this is just to repeat

01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:20,460
a note that's come up in previous

01:51:17,489 --> 01:51:22,590
discussions but you know one potential

01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:24,719
limitation of course to mentorship would

01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:26,369
appear to be the fact that at least in

01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,869
some parts of the structure there are

01:51:26,369 --> 01:51:31,559
you know there's a representative aspect

01:51:27,869 --> 01:51:32,909
to the positions so for example on the

01:51:31,559 --> 01:51:35,639
governing board and the voting positions

01:51:32,909 --> 01:51:40,320
and attack what's represented is a very

01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:42,150
practical way of you know opening that

01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:44,550
up somewhat is to have essentially you

01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:46,739
know job share for those positions from

01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:49,349
companies or other roles where you know

01:51:46,739 --> 01:51:51,239
the mentor and mentee would basically

01:51:49,349 --> 01:51:53,599
take turns or might sit together in that

01:51:51,239 --> 01:51:55,500
context but sort of only have a single

01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:56,730
representative voice for the purposes of

01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,989
voting and other things I think there

01:51:56,730 --> 01:52:01,409
are some strategies like that that we

01:51:57,989 --> 01:52:03,570
can share and encourage which would be

01:52:01,409 --> 01:52:05,730
very effective to dealing with the

01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:07,469
wording the set of opportunities I guess

01:52:05,730 --> 01:52:09,809
for access and also make it easier for

01:52:07,469 --> 01:52:11,789
people who haven't played those roles in

01:52:09,809 --> 01:52:14,159
other organizations as many of us really

01:52:11,789 --> 01:52:17,159
have to make this their first time in

01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:21,179
you know in such a position and there's

01:52:17,159 --> 01:52:22,050
a note of Chris and Chris was missing

01:52:21,179 --> 01:52:23,849
okay fine

01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:25,380
but Chris was talking about this of

01:52:23,849 --> 01:52:27,329
where as the as the new Autodesk

01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:29,309
representative that the person that they

01:52:27,329 --> 01:52:30,500
had being the representative initially

01:52:29,309 --> 01:52:32,849
was you know more of an open-source

01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:34,739
advocate and now you have someone who is

01:52:32,849 --> 01:52:36,690
you know senior director of the product

01:52:34,739 --> 01:52:39,179
stuff I can easily imagine this as well

01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:42,239
for us of where you know there's a usual

01:52:39,179 --> 01:52:43,649
suspect usual suspects aspect to the

01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:46,439
people that are sitting around this

01:52:43,649 --> 01:52:47,879
but over time it might become easier to

01:52:46,439 --> 01:52:50,879
hand that off to people inside your

01:52:47,879 --> 01:52:53,039
organization who are not like you but

01:52:50,879 --> 01:52:54,119
that have a lot to contribute to this

01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:55,530
thing and that could be the sort of

01:52:54,119 --> 01:52:57,090
handing off and Daniel and I talked

01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:59,039
about the notion of like could you

01:52:57,090 --> 01:53:02,090
timeshare a position on the tack or

01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:04,429
something so that's a way towards that

01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:06,179
well the other thing too is that

01:53:04,429 --> 01:53:06,869
technically I think you could join the

01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:07,949
tack

01:53:06,869 --> 01:53:09,449
they just don't wouldn't have voting

01:53:07,949 --> 01:53:11,849
rights so you could have more than one

01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:14,070
person I mean right but they don't want

01:53:11,849 --> 01:53:15,510
to go too often it's a commitment it you

01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:17,550
know every two weeks is like that but if

01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:19,579
you said to them every two months or

01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:22,139
every three months that's a different

01:53:19,579 --> 01:53:24,869
yeah so I'd like to add a little bit to

01:53:22,139 --> 01:53:27,449
the discussion here so a lot of this has

01:53:24,869 --> 01:53:29,039
to do with building a new pipeline or

01:53:27,449 --> 01:53:30,780
building the pipeline that's more

01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:32,429
diverse more inclusive go looking places

01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:34,050
we don't ordinarily look because in

01:53:32,429 --> 01:53:37,530
Emily Ella and I were talking about this

01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:39,809
earlier in that in in our open source

01:53:37,530 --> 01:53:41,909
world in our industry you know most of

01:53:39,809 --> 01:53:44,879
the people already know about our open

01:53:41,909 --> 01:53:46,949
source software so and are involved you

01:53:44,879 --> 01:53:47,550
know to a certain degree so where else

01:53:46,949 --> 01:53:50,129
can we go

01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:52,729
so I'm actually the one to put up on the

01:53:50,129 --> 01:53:55,409
board there you know partner with other

01:53:52,729 --> 01:53:58,129
diversity and inclusion initiatives and

01:53:55,409 --> 01:54:00,449
it just so happens the Academy has a

01:53:58,129 --> 01:54:01,860
diversity and inclusion program actually

01:54:00,449 --> 01:54:04,679
have a number of them the the one I've

01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:06,329
got in mind is the academy gold talent

01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:07,709
development program and some of the

01:54:06,329 --> 01:54:09,840
companies involved in the software

01:54:07,709 --> 01:54:11,969
foundation or even in not members but

01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:13,590
around the table here participate in

01:54:11,969 --> 01:54:17,849
that and that's an internship program

01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:19,709
directed towards college-age students

01:54:17,849 --> 01:54:24,030
and there's a follow on mentorship

01:54:19,709 --> 01:54:29,639
program with that and I'm a little sad

01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:32,189
to report that SciTech has kind of tiny

01:54:29,639 --> 01:54:34,949
tiny representation you know within the

01:54:32,189 --> 01:54:36,360
program it's a lot of production type

01:54:34,949 --> 01:54:39,719
jobs so I think there's a real

01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:41,879
opportunity to get visible there and

01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:43,469
help build that pipeline and maybe even

01:54:41,879 --> 01:54:45,659
find some people that really don't know

01:54:43,469 --> 01:54:47,309
about all of this so just just a thought

01:54:45,659 --> 01:54:48,689
and I know there are other programs

01:54:47,309 --> 01:54:51,599
within the studios and one of the

01:54:48,689 --> 01:54:53,820
companies that participate here and we

01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:57,359
could potentially leverage all that and

01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:59,879
change change the face of

01:54:57,359 --> 01:55:04,249
I like all the faces in the room but we

01:54:59,879 --> 01:55:04,249
need some more diverse ones right I

01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:14,999
didn't introduce myself before because I

01:55:12,510 --> 01:55:17,339
was eating a sandwich I'm Danielle I'm

01:55:14,999 --> 01:55:18,929
at Marvel Studios and we're actually a

01:55:17,339 --> 01:55:20,399
member of the Academy gold program and

01:55:18,929 --> 01:55:23,219
this year when we put in for an intern

01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:26,760
we asked for a computer science major

01:55:23,219 --> 01:55:29,429
and because we realized that we had more

01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:31,559
computer science needs then production

01:55:29,429 --> 01:55:34,679
needs so that's what we did it's a good

01:55:31,559 --> 01:55:38,849
idea fantastic thanks for following the

01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:40,709
the pitch here you know we've had one

01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:41,419
success story that are really with

01:55:40,709 --> 01:55:44,249
Christina

01:55:41,419 --> 01:55:46,979
there was another former colleague that

01:55:44,249 --> 01:55:48,839
I reached out to a while ago tried to

01:55:46,979 --> 01:55:50,099
talk into getting involved with the

01:55:48,839 --> 01:55:53,029
project and I think I didn't do a good

01:55:50,099 --> 01:55:57,049
enough job of kind of selling her on

01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:59,609
what's in it for her you know what I

01:55:57,049 --> 01:56:01,859
participate because it's fun and you

01:55:59,609 --> 01:56:03,749
know a lot of the hours that I put in

01:56:01,859 --> 01:56:06,539
are not actually covered by the company

01:56:03,749 --> 01:56:10,949
it's just um do it because we we enjoy

01:56:06,539 --> 01:56:12,689
it and I mean just I hate to use the

01:56:10,949 --> 01:56:14,339
word networking but it's networking it's

01:56:12,689 --> 01:56:16,949
the people you get to know and I think

01:56:14,339 --> 01:56:18,929
that's a really valuable thing I think

01:56:16,949 --> 01:56:21,809
if that's a carrot that we can hang out

01:56:18,929 --> 01:56:23,729
there for people just as an opportunity

01:56:21,809 --> 01:56:28,229
to you know rub shoulders get to know

01:56:23,729 --> 01:56:30,559
other people um but I think we need to

01:56:28,229 --> 01:56:34,409
be a little clearer about that

01:56:30,559 --> 01:56:38,279
proposition of what's in it for them you

01:56:34,409 --> 01:56:39,329
know the openexr steering committee you

01:56:38,279 --> 01:56:43,799
know in almost a year

01:56:39,329 --> 01:56:47,429
we've we've never voted on anything you

01:56:43,799 --> 01:56:48,839
know the actual sort of voting aspect of

01:56:47,429 --> 01:56:50,999
the steering committee is just not

01:56:48,839 --> 01:56:52,469
something that we ever we just figure

01:56:50,999 --> 01:56:55,139
out what to do and do it kind of

01:56:52,469 --> 01:56:59,429
implicitly I feel like that offering

01:56:55,139 --> 01:57:01,919
somebody a you know not just you know

01:56:59,429 --> 01:57:04,439
here fix some bugs and check them in you

01:57:01,919 --> 01:57:06,389
know and will thank you for it go a

01:57:04,439 --> 01:57:08,039
little bit further and say you know

01:57:06,389 --> 01:57:09,989
we'll give you this title I think that's

01:57:08,039 --> 01:57:13,440
the that's something that we

01:57:09,989 --> 01:57:17,190
can easily do with little downside to

01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:18,869
the project yeah I mean if I would

01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:20,579
actually parallel in some of the other

01:57:18,869 --> 01:57:23,369
communities that I work with its that's

01:57:20,579 --> 01:57:26,460
exactly how things start you know

01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:28,019
community has a need there's usually

01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:29,880
somebody new coming to the community

01:57:28,019 --> 01:57:32,699
doesn't know all the ins and outs of

01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:34,230
that project but somebody within there

01:57:32,699 --> 01:57:36,329
is willing to work with them to help

01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:38,579
them get to that point and then they're

01:57:36,329 --> 01:57:40,380
building that knowledge up they're able

01:57:38,579 --> 01:57:42,449
to sort of you know rise within the

01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:44,670
project naturally and then they're able

01:57:42,449 --> 01:57:46,440
to give that back you know kind of repay

01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:50,130
that back and sort of the next round

01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:51,389
around so well I will always say on

01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:54,269
diversity on one front you had to have a

01:57:51,389 --> 01:57:58,079
very conscious look at it by the other

01:57:54,269 --> 01:57:59,880
half of it sometimes it can just be very

01:57:58,079 --> 01:58:01,469
pragmatically right in front of you of

01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,880
things to take advantage of and I think

01:58:01,469 --> 01:58:04,409
I think Christine is a really great

01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:05,699
story of somebody who just popped in

01:58:04,409 --> 01:58:09,119
there and I think it's a really central

01:58:05,699 --> 01:58:10,739
figure to the project right now that's

01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:13,550
great so thank you Andy we will look

01:58:10,739 --> 01:58:17,699
into the Academy Gold Talent

01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:19,860
initiative that's what it's called an

01:58:17,699 --> 01:58:22,769
under development program look into that

01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:25,409
and circulate it and thank you for

01:58:22,769 --> 01:58:27,960
everyone for filling up the survey that

01:58:25,409 --> 01:58:30,030
gives us more data points and that's

01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:31,699
something that we will focus on as we

01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:35,099
move forward

01:58:31,699 --> 01:58:38,539
moving on to the next topic engaging

01:58:35,099 --> 01:58:42,809
with the developer community developers

01:58:38,539 --> 01:58:45,809
so we have our group we have our family

01:58:42,809 --> 01:58:48,300
and but there's a lot more a lot many

01:58:45,809 --> 01:58:50,219
more developers out there they probably

01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:54,329
know about the Academy Software

01:58:50,219 --> 01:58:56,460
Foundation most of them by now but many

01:58:54,329 --> 01:58:58,739
of them are very busy in their daily

01:58:56,460 --> 01:59:01,050
life and many of them not involved with

01:58:58,739 --> 01:59:04,139
open source software is are there new

01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:07,409
ways that we can engage with the

01:59:04,139 --> 01:59:13,530
software engineers in our industry hey

01:59:07,409 --> 01:59:16,860
then that's a good that's a good start I

01:59:13,530 --> 01:59:22,849
assume that means using some of our

01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:22,849
dollars to to hire some of them

01:59:23,309 --> 01:59:31,650
if I want to add some color to your

01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:31,650
comment don't hesitate

01:59:49,249 --> 02:00:17,809
I have a I'm going to write it by me to

02:00:15,289 --> 02:00:22,099
say it first a crazy idea should we

02:00:17,809 --> 02:00:24,050
think about having in that word of some

02:00:22,099 --> 02:00:28,699
type so someone wrote it

02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:30,409
I'll get my vote for the best software

02:00:28,699 --> 02:00:32,539
development the best open-source

02:00:30,409 --> 02:00:37,579
software development of the year as part

02:00:32,539 --> 02:00:49,280
of this I take our words sure we can

02:00:37,579 --> 02:00:51,139
investigate that naive as it may sound I

02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:54,050
think there might be some bug in having

02:00:51,139 --> 02:00:56,510
a small space for the foundation this

02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:57,260
high-tech ceremony and just you know

02:00:56,510 --> 02:01:00,289
mention it

02:00:57,260 --> 02:01:03,289
I don't know that yeah if the real you

02:01:00,289 --> 02:01:06,170
yeah yeah so last year at the site tech

02:01:03,289 --> 02:01:08,780
Awards we did have a kind of a PSA type

02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:10,880
of promo real and it was also part of

02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:11,989
the discussion with Emily earlier as and

02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:13,280
we have more time to plan for that

02:01:11,989 --> 02:01:17,300
because the awards have been moved to

02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:19,550
June yeah here so our outreach committee

02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:21,590
you know can give some fun to what

02:01:19,550 --> 02:01:22,789
what's the message and considering the

02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:25,969
audience and what you want to accomplish

02:01:22,789 --> 02:01:31,519
so so we know we've got that the idea of

02:01:25,969 --> 02:01:33,380
you know some kind of compatible award

02:01:31,519 --> 02:01:34,760
that that's a whole nother topic we do

02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:36,499
have some people that are on the site

02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:39,289
tech awards main committee steering

02:01:36,499 --> 02:01:40,729
committee as well here that might

02:01:39,289 --> 02:01:44,389
consider that they'd be better suited to

02:01:40,729 --> 02:01:47,559
do that than I would I'm gonna make a

02:01:44,389 --> 02:01:51,519
provocative statement and say that the

02:01:47,559 --> 02:01:55,150
people that are involved in judging and

02:01:51,519 --> 02:01:58,070
attending and winning the SciTech awards

02:01:55,150 --> 02:02:01,190
overlaps very strongly with the people

02:01:58,070 --> 02:02:01,690
already involved in a SWF so I don't

02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:03,760
yeah

02:02:01,690 --> 02:02:05,230
I don't know how much that's good for

02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:09,670
engaging in people who aren't already

02:02:05,230 --> 02:02:10,960
aware of or part of the process I throw

02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:13,239
that out strongly agree with that

02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,640
sentiment Larry unless there was some

02:02:13,239 --> 02:02:18,630
other way that the awards were broadcast

02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:18,630
or something to a broader audience

02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:28,440
okay at that point if there was

02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:30,580
something like that then we could

02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:33,460
communicate this to the brother

02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:34,870
engineering community and you know this

02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:37,090
I think I would currently are not about

02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:38,949
certain categories of things in the past

02:02:37,090 --> 02:02:41,380
but if there was something that was

02:02:38,949 --> 02:02:44,739
about software engineering this year you

02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:47,500
have a project submitted you can win in

02:02:44,739 --> 02:02:51,610
a word and it can be something different

02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:53,199
than the plaque or the but we could take

02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:56,760
something like that and then broadcast

02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:58,989
it to the larger group of folks perhaps

02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:01,360
there's a question from the zoom that

02:02:58,989 --> 02:03:04,150
says could the foundation helped push

02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:06,130
trusted partner Network to open up for

02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:08,020
directly contributing to the projects

02:03:06,130 --> 02:03:10,150
for Studios behind strict security

02:03:08,020 --> 02:03:11,860
restrictions I believe it would help at

02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:17,860
least smaller studios without a large

02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:19,270
development apartment contribute I I'm

02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:23,560
not sure indiscernible City mutation

02:03:19,270 --> 02:03:25,060
right if you know access doing direct

02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:26,380
access to the internet to download open

02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:27,760
source libraries and compile them and

02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:29,800
within your production environment ebn

02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,960
doesn't doesn't stop downloads or stop

02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:34,600
shops loads it's the other direction

02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:36,699
that's programmatic and and I think it's

02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:38,140
the nature the point so it's if you if

02:03:36,699 --> 02:03:40,560
the developers want to contribute and

02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:43,300
that's an upload from their own network

02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:45,310
yeah okay how can you contribute

02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:49,780
directly from the network if part of

02:03:45,310 --> 02:03:56,020
your FTE job is to do this coding yeah I

02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:58,330
shouldn't comment any further not a

02:03:56,020 --> 02:04:00,830
nation

02:03:58,330 --> 02:04:02,660
so I don't want my developers to upload

02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:06,860
I want to sign off the upload and to see

02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:09,320
those out there for that reason yeah is

02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:12,560
some ongoing discussion off mic here

02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:16,520
which I won't repeat for the room but

02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:19,340
thank you I will say that was part of

02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:21,140
the point that I tried to capture with

02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:24,880
promote modern software development

02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:27,470
processes and environments I think

02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:29,840
actually getting to the point clear

02:04:27,470 --> 02:04:32,360
organizations need to and want to have

02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:35,450
controls about contribution but ideally

02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:37,070
those things are as we always say there

02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:39,170
should be the domain of policy rather

02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:42,080
than just you know frustration and

02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:43,670
friction and that there are definitely

02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:45,950
things that we can do as we have done

02:04:43,670 --> 02:04:50,510
with some of the choices we made for CI

02:04:45,950 --> 02:04:53,960
for example excuse me which make it much

02:04:50,510 --> 02:04:56,600
simpler for people to engage and one of

02:04:53,960 --> 02:05:00,020
the consequences I think of the security

02:04:56,600 --> 02:05:02,060
environment we have worked in is that

02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:04,460
you know many of the technologies we use

02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:06,110
are a little bit isolated and different

02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:07,910
from what you know developers are

02:05:06,110 --> 02:05:09,170
working with elsewhere or you know

02:05:07,910 --> 02:05:11,270
people are learning in school and

02:05:09,170 --> 02:05:13,820
there's definitely an opportunity for us

02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:16,100
to try and actually make sure that you

02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:18,740
know developing on our projects and you

02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:21,890
know is a comfortable and modern

02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:24,080
experience and similarly and this speaks

02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:26,060
to the sort of download side of the

02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:28,430
question as well

02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:31,070
that the security policies that are in

02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:33,080
place in studios are not detrimental to

02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:35,780
work clothes that developers typically

02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:39,320
use and that means you know sensible and

02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:41,000
realistic access to you know source code

02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:42,800
and data repositories and other things

02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,960
you know where that makes sense and

02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:47,150
under whatever a specific restriction

02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:49,490
studios want to impose but you know I

02:05:47,150 --> 02:05:51,260
guess the question I have for the room

02:05:49,490 --> 02:05:53,630
as well is you know is that something

02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:55,700
that the SWF can meaningfully take as

02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:57,860
its mandate to try and add the cake for

02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:59,900
you know effective saw our development

02:05:57,860 --> 02:06:05,030
environments and workflows who within

02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:07,020
our industry actually I took one point

02:06:05,030 --> 02:06:08,400
from what you said

02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:11,580
should we talk to educational

02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:12,900
institution to show the maybe the

02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:15,090
advanced students how to do software

02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:17,310
development at this scale because you're

02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:19,440
I've never seen it taught but people

02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:20,850
don't live in university they're 23 they

02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:23,280
should have a sense that this is how

02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:25,140
larger organizations operate and I don't

02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:26,490
know that they do and instead they at

02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:28,230
least it should be similar ability for

02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:31,410
somebody to follow a course or something

02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:37,590
on this that's that's being mounting my

02:06:31,410 --> 02:06:39,300
habit or vice versa but yes but I do

02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:43,260
agree and not just cuz we work at the

02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:46,170
same company that that's a good idea to

02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:49,320
use the foundation to be able to say

02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:51,000
reach out to the TPN or CDC si because a

02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:52,290
lot of like Larry was saying there's a

02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,430
lot of overlap between a lot of these

02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:58,560
people on these committees and

02:06:55,430 --> 02:07:01,530
establishing some clear workflows that

02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:04,920
are essentially automatic like that

02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:07,410
would be passing a TPN audit would be

02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:08,730
valuable I think to not just the large

02:07:07,410 --> 02:07:10,050
players who have already figured it out

02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:18,570
for themselves but to the smaller

02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:23,520
players alright well noted thank you 15

02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:28,290
minutes left in our meeting I would like

02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:31,290
to ask if you have new member companies

02:07:28,290 --> 02:07:36,840
new companies that could become members

02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:39,360
of the foundation and there's the poll

02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:42,860
if there are companies that are not here

02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:50,330
that you think we should be looking into

02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:50,330
we'll make it short that's a good one

02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:59,220
it's a software vendor studios and to

02:07:55,320 --> 02:08:02,040
the point of our goal to go for general

02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:04,740
members and smaller studios smaller

02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:07,560
studios that you know that are starting

02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:12,710
to use open source or thinking about

02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:12,710
contributing don't know necessarily how

02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:16,580
this is good

02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:41,899
[Music]

02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:50,540
many new names there I'll give you ten

02:08:48,810 --> 02:09:07,050
more seconds

02:08:50,540 --> 02:09:12,750
before we move on to the next topic all

02:09:07,050 --> 02:09:14,990
right three two one

02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:19,790
[Music]

02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:22,790
moving on working group so we have to

02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:26,490
talk about this one as it's been the

02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:30,410
topic at multiple level today

02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:34,440
so working groups we want to start doing

02:09:30,410 --> 02:09:37,230
working groups we have a basic process

02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:38,780
for managing them along the lines of

02:09:37,230 --> 02:09:44,340
those bullets that we described before

02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:47,370
and we've spoken about USD and so first

02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:50,580
I'd like to provide the opportunity for

02:09:47,370 --> 02:09:53,370
everyone to list topics that you think

02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:58,020
we should do u.s. group and working

02:09:53,370 --> 02:10:03,900
group on so R as was mentioned one

02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:10,820
person read R as write res as one of the

02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:10,820
options please or I'll do it

02:10:37,110 --> 02:10:54,340
so only vote for the res that has a vote

02:10:40,030 --> 02:10:58,990
already and as we continue that and we

02:10:54,340 --> 02:11:03,040
we stated our intent to help USD I'd

02:10:58,990 --> 02:11:06,490
like to invite Steve who is at Pixar and

02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:09,160
in charge of USD to maybe tell us Steve

02:11:06,490 --> 02:11:12,220
if you want how do you think at this

02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:16,000
point the foundation can best help you

02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:17,950
as you're developing USD moving forward

02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,630
full disclosure I haven't really thought

02:11:17,950 --> 02:11:21,400
that much about it I just kind of start

02:11:19,630 --> 02:11:25,840
talking to rob in the last few days

02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:27,600
actually about the idea we we definitely

02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:31,300
could use more help so we're we're very

02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:33,580
overwhelmed both emotionally positively

02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:35,800
by the the adoption and excitement

02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:38,590
around USD we're also overwhelmed from

02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:41,680
an engineering standpoint we we do spend

02:11:38,590 --> 02:11:43,630
a lot of time engineers just maintaining

02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:45,820
the forums and responding to questions

02:11:43,630 --> 02:11:46,690
they're very invested and dedicated and

02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:49,360
they feel like they're the ones that

02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:51,580
have to answer so and I realized that

02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:52,960
we're still building other Studios are

02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:55,860
still building and vendors of building

02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:59,170
expertise about USD but be great to have

02:11:55,860 --> 02:12:01,840
helped with that so that our engineers

02:11:59,170 --> 02:12:03,220
could get kind of offload some of even

02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:06,040
just the forum discussion would be a

02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:07,900
would be a huge a huge help as well as

02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:10,840
of course helping us deal with with

02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:12,970
closing issues etc I haven't thought

02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:14,860
about exactly how we would do this but

02:12:12,970 --> 02:12:18,040
we I mean like I said we would we would

02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:20,380
certainly welcome additional help and if

02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:23,080
it if it made sense we could maybe do

02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:24,610
something at we could host a thing at

02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:25,900
Pixar or somewhere else where we could

02:12:24,610 --> 02:12:28,200
also kind of bring in people who could

02:12:25,900 --> 02:12:31,240
potentially help us more maybe to give a

02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:32,590
additional training or discussion with

02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:34,450
the original developers to learn more

02:12:32,590 --> 02:12:40,240
about USD I mean open to any ideas

02:12:34,450 --> 02:12:44,230
around that okay that's great and and

02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:45,119
and so are we in the idea of doing a

02:12:44,230 --> 02:12:47,010
session that's

02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:50,040
the formation of this working group and

02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:53,909
what is it that it could do to start

02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:57,780
with a meeting at Pixar or with a number

02:12:53,909 --> 02:12:59,790
of people from your team and and people

02:12:57,780 --> 02:13:02,639
in the foundation who have expertise

02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:05,280
people like John and others at the

02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:07,199
foundation that have operated working

02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:11,429
groups in all kinds of different Emily

02:13:07,199 --> 02:13:13,110
also in all kind of different groups in

02:13:11,429 --> 02:13:17,400
larger industry like the automotive

02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:19,949
industry and another software industry

02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:22,110
we can then listen more closely about

02:13:19,949 --> 02:13:24,750
what what is needed what we can do from

02:13:22,110 --> 02:13:27,239
our position and put that in writing

02:13:24,750 --> 02:13:30,929
into the goals of that particular

02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:34,380
working group John Emily you have

02:13:30,929 --> 02:13:37,050
experience in these other industries are

02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:38,760
there something you want to mention

02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:42,260
about that and two in terms of models

02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:42,260
that we could take to get it started

02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:51,540
excuse me yes I think it would be good

02:13:48,929 --> 02:13:53,070
to probably maybe Steve have maybe a

02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:54,060
little bit of a conversation on some of

02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:56,250
the background just sort of

02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:58,590
understanding some of the the people at

02:13:56,250 --> 02:14:01,080
play here to dig into it but it's

02:13:58,590 --> 02:14:02,670
certainly something we've done both in

02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:04,679
topical areas we've also done it

02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:08,099
vertically so there's a lot of different

02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:09,869
ways that it can modeled the nice thing

02:14:08,099 --> 02:14:11,880
is if this flows within sort of the

02:14:09,869 --> 02:14:13,170
natural technical community structure so

02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:15,780
it's something that flows within to the

02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:19,590
TAC so you're kind of getting all the

02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:21,090
right connection points there so yeah I

02:14:19,590 --> 02:14:24,119
mean there's I guess the short answer is

02:14:21,090 --> 02:14:25,290
yes but these also things each one's a

02:14:24,119 --> 02:14:26,369
little bit different so it's probably

02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:30,570
good just to understand all the details

02:14:26,369 --> 02:14:32,790
and we certainly want to customize given

02:14:30,570 --> 02:14:35,849
that it's our first one we have that

02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:38,639
opportunity to really adapt it to to the

02:14:35,849 --> 02:14:41,310
need of this of the specific project

02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:42,960
that we want to support I also wonder

02:14:41,310 --> 02:14:45,449
David if it might be interesting to

02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:47,400
spend a bit of time before we kick it

02:14:45,449 --> 02:14:48,630
off or kick off an on site just

02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:50,099
understanding what the goal of that

02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:51,780
group is that was one thing I loved in

02:14:50,099 --> 02:14:54,239
their description the working group had

02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:56,610
a goal and the word USD is not a goal

02:14:54,239 --> 02:14:58,130
right so what is the goal of that group

02:14:56,610 --> 02:15:00,770
is the goal to

02:14:58,130 --> 02:15:03,500
help scale and support the USD project

02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:05,210
is the goal to put some things around

02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:08,659
the project so it's easier for studios

02:15:05,210 --> 02:15:10,670
to invest in and cut into go to their

02:15:08,659 --> 02:15:11,960
pipeline or is the goal something else

02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:14,630
right because I think if we're clear on

02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:18,110
what we're trying to do it may suggest a

02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:19,790
way of getting there so I was thinking

02:15:18,110 --> 02:15:21,800
about that when they said that what Jen

02:15:19,790 --> 02:15:24,020
again I the same response of where it's

02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:25,880
like oh you know it's time boxed and

02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:27,710
it's trying to solve a problem and so

02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:29,510
one of the things I was writing down was

02:15:27,710 --> 02:15:31,790
some notes on that is we should that

02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:33,590
group should not try and address the

02:15:31,790 --> 02:15:36,139
things that are still very much in play

02:15:33,590 --> 02:15:37,429
of like you know programmable materials

02:15:36,139 --> 02:15:39,530
and coding them in their animation

02:15:37,429 --> 02:15:40,909
curves rigging like those are a lot of

02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:42,800
things that people would like to do with

02:15:40,909 --> 02:15:44,540
USD but they're not on the you know or

02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:45,860
some of them are being worked on but

02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:48,980
there's a whole bunch of things like

02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:52,070
backlot assets like how do you will

02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:54,469
organize a given asset in a really

02:15:52,070 --> 02:15:56,239
nicely well-structured USD way like what

02:15:54,469 --> 02:15:58,159
kind of layers should you have you know

02:15:56,239 --> 02:15:59,540
should you be using subdivision surfaces

02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:00,800
should you have variants on the preview

02:15:59,540 --> 02:16:02,360
meats or like there's things of where

02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:04,100
like the pieces are all out there

02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:06,050
different Studios probably have

02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:09,350
different opinions on that but if we

02:16:06,050 --> 02:16:11,360
could be showing some reasonable best

02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:13,580
practice so some studio that was

02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:15,469
considering it would be like oh that's a

02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:17,360
yeah we could do that you know and

02:16:15,469 --> 02:16:20,270
that's not exactly the way the big dogs

02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:21,770
that you know it Pixar Disney or or

02:16:20,270 --> 02:16:23,570
Animal Logic or whatever are doing it

02:16:21,770 --> 02:16:25,580
but it's it's a reasonable way to do it

02:16:23,570 --> 02:16:27,260
that could be really helpful I think and

02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:28,730
just to be clear like I love the

02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:30,500
suggestion we're the start from rob of

02:16:28,730 --> 02:16:32,059
you know jumping and helping in the

02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:33,080
forums like I'm definitely not against

02:16:32,059 --> 02:16:34,820
helping in which we're trying to do a

02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:36,019
little bit of that from an auditors side

02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:38,210
as well but I just think would be

02:16:36,019 --> 02:16:40,460
interesting to just make sure we

02:16:38,210 --> 02:16:42,439
understand what people would love to get

02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:47,240
out of that before we assume a direction

02:16:42,439 --> 02:16:49,010
and jump in okay so one area I'm curious

02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:54,649
about and I think Gordon's question is

02:16:49,010 --> 02:16:57,490
is is very cute with us stay there

02:16:54,649 --> 02:17:01,719
obviously sort of many many facets and

02:16:57,490 --> 02:17:04,700
if you look at the forums much discussed

02:17:01,719 --> 02:17:06,620
there are definitely different themes or

02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:09,769
threads of discussion there summer loves

02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:12,080
the you know how do I do this variety

02:17:09,769 --> 02:17:14,569
and that's you know fairly obvious that

02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:17,960
as the knowledge in the community Rises

02:17:14,569 --> 02:17:20,359
then particularly if you know encouraged

02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:21,380
and empowered and other individuals

02:17:20,359 --> 02:17:25,760
outside it because I can definitely

02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:27,859
contribute usefully there but what also

02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:32,120
happens a lot is that you know there are

02:17:27,859 --> 02:17:34,489
much more difficult questions of how do

02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:36,139
I do this where the answer is not a

02:17:34,489 --> 02:17:38,649
technical one but a you know a matter of

02:17:36,139 --> 02:17:41,210
sort of philosophy or best practice or

02:17:38,649 --> 02:17:43,939
you know schema design to put things

02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:47,719
into a particular USD kind of context

02:17:43,939 --> 02:17:50,989
and in that space I guess there's an

02:17:47,719 --> 02:17:52,460
obvious question well what we think

02:17:50,989 --> 02:17:55,609
about you know a working group or some

02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:57,319
other structure you know offering some

02:17:55,609 --> 02:17:58,969
kind of environment for decisions of

02:17:57,319 --> 02:18:02,599
those choices I mean you could easily

02:17:58,969 --> 02:18:04,189
kind of probably put it show up every

02:18:02,599 --> 02:18:05,599
one spine but I sort of calling this ER

02:18:04,189 --> 02:18:08,179
you know the architecture Review Board

02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:09,800
kind of analogy but I think as USD grows

02:18:08,179 --> 02:18:11,330
something of that nature is necessary

02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:12,649
and that can be separate from projected

02:18:11,330 --> 02:18:14,630
option it can be quite separate from

02:18:12,649 --> 02:18:16,250
project an option and it might make

02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:18,649
sense and I think I've kind of heard a

02:18:16,250 --> 02:18:21,920
few people say this is to think about

02:18:18,649 --> 02:18:23,120
the working groups maybe you also within

02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:24,590
the dimension I think somebody mentioned

02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:27,739
I think maybe was Gordon you is like a

02:18:24,590 --> 02:18:29,899
time bound activity so there's a clear

02:18:27,739 --> 02:18:32,059
goal upfront this is what we're trying

02:18:29,899 --> 02:18:33,739
to achieve out of it this is you know

02:18:32,059 --> 02:18:35,840
the deliverable that we're expecting to

02:18:33,739 --> 02:18:37,609
come out of it and this is sort of the

02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:40,460
general timeline the we know that we're

02:18:37,609 --> 02:18:41,809
expecting get it done in it also kind of

02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:43,160
helps Center the group because I think

02:18:41,809 --> 02:18:45,080
that's always one of the anti-patterns

02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:46,370
with working groups is it just becomes a

02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:49,069
group that just keeps on going on going

02:18:46,370 --> 02:18:50,899
on and you really wanted to make sure

02:18:49,069 --> 02:18:53,210
it's delivering value back to the

02:18:50,899 --> 02:18:55,460
project its delivering value back to the

02:18:53,210 --> 02:18:56,840
community so the beauty is this model

02:18:55,460 --> 02:18:59,840
you can spin up as many as one so if

02:18:56,840 --> 02:19:01,550
maybe if you need six around USD to have

02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:05,960
all the main key points that's something

02:19:01,550 --> 02:19:08,830
to contentiously be done in just at this

02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:11,359
other time bound i think is critical

02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:13,609
just as an interesting data point i've

02:19:11,359 --> 02:19:15,920
done a fair bit of research recently

02:19:13,609 --> 02:19:18,199
around innovation models in software

02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:19,309
development in our company and the magic

02:19:18,199 --> 02:19:21,739
number a lot of people settled on is

02:19:19,309 --> 02:19:23,300
three months like if you go past three

02:19:21,739 --> 02:19:24,520
months and say okay you guys have this

02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:26,770
goal in a year

02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:29,500
two years the or just no time at all

02:19:26,770 --> 02:19:31,090
it'll just meander whereas okay it's a

02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:32,770
big problem let's break it down what are

02:19:31,090 --> 02:19:34,750
we trying to get done in three months or

02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:36,490
one month like pick a time pick a goal

02:19:34,750 --> 02:19:38,350
it'll never be the whole problem where

02:19:36,490 --> 02:19:40,390
are we starting and then I think it'd be

02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:42,040
great to maybe as part of defining

02:19:40,390 --> 02:19:43,390
element maturing our working group model

02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:45,310
to have some way for that to kind of

02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:47,260
connect back both across the tech and

02:19:45,310 --> 02:19:48,460
the governing board so that we can kind

02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:54,940
of get that that high level steering

02:19:48,460 --> 02:20:00,750
happening as well that's good short

02:19:54,940 --> 02:20:05,410
timeframe this is great feedback and we

02:20:00,750 --> 02:20:09,120
we will form the working group shortly

02:20:05,410 --> 02:20:13,030
and we will reach out to Pixar and

02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:18,070
define what these parameters should be

02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:20,080
to help us D a key project in our

02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:22,570
industry I think we all know that and we

02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:25,950
all know why but it's worth stating

02:20:22,570 --> 02:20:28,690
again because here we have high-level

02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:31,271
system and data structure for movie

02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:33,641
motion picture projects that if it was

02:20:31,271 --> 02:20:37,891
adopted widely would make it much easier

02:20:33,641 --> 02:20:41,230
to exchange data movie data between

02:20:37,891 --> 02:20:43,420
different projects and there's a great

02:20:41,230 --> 02:20:45,820
value to that as constant content is

02:20:43,420 --> 02:20:49,450
exploding and the demands on production

02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:51,851
are becoming ever more stringent to

02:20:49,450 --> 02:20:53,710
deliver faster and better and there is a

02:20:51,851 --> 02:20:56,681
lot of opportunity for interaction

02:20:53,710 --> 02:20:59,830
between the movie projects and all sorts

02:20:56,681 --> 02:21:03,820
of other media USD is coming at a time

02:20:59,830 --> 02:21:06,670
where it is needed and here in our

02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:09,971
neutral platform this is a place where

02:21:06,670 --> 02:21:12,311
we can help when there is a project like

02:21:09,971 --> 02:21:15,391
this that happens that's our intent so

02:21:12,311 --> 02:21:15,391
we'll see how we go about it

02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:24,700
and there's the there's the slide so

02:21:22,290 --> 02:21:28,630
Universal scene description how can we

02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:31,510
have Pixar with us D there are some item

02:21:28,630 --> 02:21:34,360
here include you as these sessions at

02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:35,920
open source that is one simple action

02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:39,570
item that

02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:41,979
we should probably do for cigarettes and

02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:46,860
highlight the work of you is the early

02:21:41,979 --> 02:21:50,140
adopters so many of you and give away to

02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:54,250
a form use our megaphone use our website

02:21:50,140 --> 02:21:58,600
use our outreach budget to start putting

02:21:54,250 --> 02:22:03,640
forward the good example of you as the

02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:04,990
use in a similar way that we're

02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:08,229
highlighting the work of software

02:22:04,990 --> 02:22:21,010
engineers we can highlight success

02:22:08,229 --> 02:22:32,260
stories alongside with Pixar sample data

02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:35,320
sets it certainly would be useful I can

02:22:32,260 --> 02:22:38,950
share a little bit of our experience at

02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:43,920
Epic Games implementing USD which is

02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:48,660
known that we are working on that and

02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:52,479
sample data set and also users of USD

02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:56,439
where are they how to find them is a

02:22:52,479 --> 02:22:59,020
question that engineers have had and of

02:22:56,439 --> 02:23:02,260
course we can all go to Pixar perhaps

02:22:59,020 --> 02:23:05,320
that's part of one of the one of the

02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:08,470
issues that at Pixar you have a lot of

02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:12,070
demand coming from everywhere and if we

02:23:08,470 --> 02:23:15,540
can help in some way alleviate that the

02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:19,290
mentor you can focus on engineering USD

02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:19,290
is something that would be good

02:23:38,170 --> 02:23:49,210
that's you all right and more seconds on

02:23:46,850 --> 02:23:49,210
that one

02:24:00,190 --> 02:24:09,350
thank you this will be very helpful as

02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:13,550
we tackle our working group no one's put

02:24:09,350 --> 02:24:18,340
up just antics are more money synthetics

02:24:13,550 --> 02:24:21,830
are more money yes um oh okay

02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:25,340
just a suggestion all right you fix our

02:24:21,830 --> 02:24:28,850
money you can write that they think

02:24:25,340 --> 02:24:36,860
you've got people's main give you the

02:24:28,850 --> 02:24:39,290
information afterwards all right so

02:24:36,860 --> 02:24:40,310
before we're too much overtime here's

02:24:39,290 --> 02:24:43,400
the last one

02:24:40,310 --> 02:24:45,940
so this was our second form we covered a

02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:48,710
lot of ground we covered some high-level

02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:51,770
thinking we updated everyone on our

02:24:48,710 --> 02:24:54,080
projects and the great core work that is

02:24:51,770 --> 02:24:55,670
done in the TAC we discuss different

02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:58,370
topics is there anything here that we

02:24:55,670 --> 02:25:01,130
did not touch wrong that we should have

02:24:58,370 --> 02:25:05,810
it's the last question of the day after

02:25:01,130 --> 02:25:09,280
that we're done with the meeting it

02:25:05,810 --> 02:25:09,280
would be nice for state-ranked oops

02:25:11,790 --> 02:25:14,540
all right

02:25:33,471 --> 02:25:39,440
so I have a question the first line mean

02:25:35,960 --> 02:25:45,110
that the foundation should like hold the

02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:48,080
one island kind of thing like have Daman

02:25:45,110 --> 02:25:52,761
island and on the foundation service is

02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:55,490
that some stuff that so people who are

02:25:52,761 --> 02:25:58,671
trying to understand whether they're a

02:25:55,490 --> 02:26:01,160
vendor or they're an artist like what

02:25:58,671 --> 02:26:03,620
what qualifies like what you know it's

02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:05,030
like she should have 4k textures or you

02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:06,950
should have you should use you Tim's or

02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:08,931
you should have that isn't in examples

02:26:06,950 --> 02:26:11,540
of things of where you know use

02:26:08,931 --> 02:26:13,761
subdivision surfaces organize it this

02:26:11,540 --> 02:26:15,440
way these sorts of naming conventions if

02:26:13,761 --> 02:26:16,761
you're not in the industry have

02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:18,440
someplace you could look at that you'd

02:26:16,761 --> 02:26:21,650
be like oh those are the kinds of things

02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:23,631
that people would expect yeah that was a

02:26:21,650 --> 02:26:25,521
some of the school send and done his

02:26:23,631 --> 02:26:29,210
point on software development by writing

02:26:25,521 --> 02:26:31,101
the asset structure same thing like the

02:26:29,210 --> 02:26:32,301
guys in the they're teaching the schools

02:26:31,101 --> 02:26:34,460
don't know this stuff right then

02:26:32,301 --> 02:26:36,860
we can certainly explain to them what

02:26:34,460 --> 02:26:38,351
they need to distribute yeah you could

02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:41,601
imagine that being something that

02:26:38,351 --> 02:26:42,801
studios would be like oh sure well even

02:26:41,601 --> 02:26:44,960
if it's just new stuff that they're

02:26:42,801 --> 02:26:46,400
gonna put their people on to make you

02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:51,171
know like this is what we would consider

02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:55,851
to be what what we would expect I mean a

02:26:51,171 --> 02:26:59,210
few years ago Larry showed up I want to

02:26:55,851 --> 02:27:00,771
say it was secret New Orleans and said

02:26:59,210 --> 02:27:03,830
we should make a shared asset and then

02:27:00,771 --> 02:27:05,931
you know eventually Disney shared the

02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:08,000
Des Moines Ireland but another idea that

02:27:05,931 --> 02:27:10,610
was vented at at the time was to host

02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,110
students in the studios and drive them

02:27:10,610 --> 02:27:14,780
to building an asset that was meant to

02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:16,490
be shared from day one but it was

02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:18,620
financed you know in collaboration with

02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:20,750
education institutions yes that the

02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:22,460
kitchen scene in USD U is made by a

02:27:20,750 --> 02:27:26,990
bunch of students at the Carroll summer

02:27:22,460 --> 02:27:29,030
yeah that kind of pattern right we

02:27:26,990 --> 02:27:31,490
discussed the same idea for simulation

02:27:29,030 --> 02:27:34,610
never happen

02:27:31,490 --> 02:27:34,610
[Music]

02:27:37,990 --> 02:27:46,910
that is the last question that I have

02:27:42,891 --> 02:27:50,170
and it concludes if there is nothing

02:27:46,910 --> 02:27:52,761
else it concludes our meeting for the

02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:55,670
second forum of the Academy Software

02:27:52,761 --> 02:27:59,301
Foundation we hope to see you at

02:27:55,670 --> 02:28:02,811

done here in the foundation if you have

02:28:16,190 --> 02:28:19,851

we spoken a lot about the TAC today and

02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:50,960
I did what do we encourage or invite

02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:52,641
