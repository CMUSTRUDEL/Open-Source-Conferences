thank you for being here so early to our

00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:14,700

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:17,520
feather and we are one year old the

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,520
Academy Software Foundation was started

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,570
here a year ago on August 10th and we're

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,269
very happy to welcome you back on our

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,869
birds of a feather this morning we are

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,450
the attack and Emily Olin are going to

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,579
come up and present to you an update of

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,660
where we are on the Academy Software

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,809
Foundation a year later so we are going

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:55,289
to go into four section we're going to

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:58,890
look back on our first year and what we

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,930
achieved at this point emily is going to

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,780
tell us more about open source day

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,700
that's going on today as you know Dan is

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,820
going to cover the technical advisory

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,799
council progress and state and then Rob

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,470
is going to drive us through a

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,680
discussion that we want to be

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,939
interactive with you about the second

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:26,280
year and how that should look like but

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:30,420
first we have a video okay we dim the

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,600
house lights a little bit let's have a

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,600
look

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,619
every single part of the filmmaking

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,229
process is touched by software and a lot

00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:52,090
of that software is open-source software

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,460
the Academy Software Foundation exists

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,009
to provide a great home for open source

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,549
projects that we as an industry use

00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,549
every day

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:37,369
[Music]

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,010
you are a user of open-source software

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,450
or an engineer or a company that relies

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,310
on open source software we want to

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,420
create the right ecosystem for you to

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,610
get the most out of the open source

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,870
software that you need to use find us at

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,470
a SWF Keio and join the mailing list and

00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:03,760
see how you can get involved

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:09,980
[Music]

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:12,260
press thank you to Steve tow bankin who

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,550
produced this video and is helping us

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,140
with the video aspect of our

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:21,830
communication fresh off the press so we

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,989
are one year old and we're I'm going to

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,050
go first with the goals and mission that

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:30,110
by now most of you know that we had when

00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,700
we started the foundation so you know

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,680
that the academic software foundation is

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,900
there to provide a neutral forum for

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,800
open source software in our motion

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,420
picture and media industries for image

00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,769
creation visual effects animation and

00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,180
sound we're there to increase the

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,760
quality and quantity of open source

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,250
software contribution by establishing

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,489
governance model legal legal framework

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:59,570
and community infrastructure that lowers

00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:01,880
the barrier to entry our goals provide

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,610
the neutral forum to coordinate cross

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,580
project efforts to develop a continuous

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,950
integration and build infrastructure to

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,630
enable reference builds to streamline

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,820
the development for build and runtime

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,980
environments through the sharing of open

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,080
source build configurations and to

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,150
provide individuals and organizations

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,300
with a clear path to participation and

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,640
contribution and to provide better more

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,330
consistent licensing to her chair

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:33,800
licensing intently these were our goals

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:37,190
when we started and the Academy Software

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,640
Foundation was the decision to create it

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,930
who has taken on February 12 2018 I'm

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,100
going to go back in a little bit of

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,360
quick history at that time at 3:30 when

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,979
a vote was taken by the invest

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,409
datian committee that was looking at

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:55,349
what the Academy can do could do should

00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:59,129
do in the for the open source community

00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:59,819
and from from that time it took us a

00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:03,689
little while

00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:07,469
August 10th 2018 a little less than a

00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:10,830
year ago we created the foundation here

00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:12,960
at SIGGRAPH in Vancouver at that time

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,729
with our founding members so our

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,770
founding members many of you are here

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:18,930
had gone with us through the

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,779
investigation process and I decided to

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:25,050
commit to make this happen this this

00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:28,830
initial group was was very important to

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,319
get everything started and then we went

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,210
over the last year into a quick series

00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,669
of announcement

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:42,659
Sonne joined along with Warner Brothers

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:45,719
shortly thereafter on October 23rd open

00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:48,840
VDB our first project also joined at

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:51,900
that time and our associate members the

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:56,190
ves and the blender foundation joined us

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:59,009
at that time also later on May 1st and

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:10,080
Vidya F track and Red Hat joined the

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:15,500
Academy and then we had open collar i/o

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,500
that joined on February 8th of this year

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:25,710
this was followed with openexr and open

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:28,979
Q becoming projects and by then we had

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,479
four projects in the foundation a little

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,139
more than six months after this we

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:38,189
started and today we have announced that

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:40,710
Netflix is joining the Academy and that

00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:44,580
we have a fifth project open timeline

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:48,449
i/o gifted by Pixar that's that is also

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:51,419
becoming part of our roster and that

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:54,589
Amazon Web Services rodeo effects and

00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:59,760
movie labs are also joining the

00:06:54,589 --> 00:07:02,490
foundation and this is our group

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,510
of companies our group of members that

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:10,110
are creating the Academy Software

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:13,470
Foundation as we go it is a powerful

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:17,060
group of companies that are dedicated to

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:21,720
make the cause of open-source go forward

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:25,440
I've also been authorized to say that we

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,830
can count on Apple to join us will be

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,020
our next member to come the announcement

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,660
in quite a line for the the timing of

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,370
SIGGRAPH but we're looking forward to

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:40,500
that and on the funding side to be a

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,360
little bit more practical what that

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,520
means every one of the premier members

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,240
and the general members contribute both

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:51,000
monetarily and with engineering to the

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,450
foundation our yearly founding is

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,750
currently at with the members that we

00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:02,520
have is at nine hundred and fifty five

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:04,530
thousand dollar a year our goal is to

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:09,330
reach a million dollar was set the

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:11,520
deadline by September 30th so we I am

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:14,820
looking in my role as executive director

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,670
at finding at least one more premier

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:21,240
member to get us over the line in the

00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:24,810
next few months and so that we can reach

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,090
that milestone of being well founded and

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:32,280
organized as an organization that can

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:37,260
then do with money support the open

00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,870
source community and and reach our goals

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,880
our funds go to infrastructure cost

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:47,280
Linux Foundation support marketing

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:49,740
projects and community support so I want

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,720
to invite Emily Pollan to come and tell

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,580
us about community support that we're

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,430
doing here at SIGGRAPH and particularly

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,430
open source day that she has organized

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,270
thanks everybody for coming out we put

00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,270
together

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:28,480
and to make it easier for everybody to

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,490
attend all the sessions that you want so

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,930
this is our first calling an unofficial

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,280
open source day hopefully this is

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,500
something that will continue in the

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,330
coming years but we put together a full

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,400
lineup we hope you guys stay for the

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,230
full day come and go as you please we

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,450
will have lunch here we've got a lot of

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:48,250
swag outside shirts and stickers and

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,840
thank you all for participating and it's

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,670
you are the community that makes the

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,770
foundation possible so thank you all and

00:09:51,670 --> 00:10:02,290
I'm gonna turn it over now to Daniel

00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:05,110
heck and Berg who's our attack chair let

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,760
me just I think my lapel mic is working

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,080
good

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank You Emily so the Technical

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,440
Advisory Council is an organization that

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,930
I hope by now many of you are familiar

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,540
with I'm going to go into just a little

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,580
bit of detail but mainly try and draw a

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,830
focus on to the projects which are

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,920
indeed the lifeblood of you know of the

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:30,280
foundation and the motivation for all of

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,230
the work we actually do so with that in

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,660
mind let's look at the projects we've

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,520
managed to support and bring into the

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:40,630
foundation in our first year very

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:42,370
pleased to have reached five projects

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,130
which represented a broad spread not

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,770
only of the established projects which

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,270
was so much the focus of the processes

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,670
to form the Academy Software Foundation

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,760
but also to support some new projects

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,250
and encourage them to build adoption and

00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,020
find ways of collaboration to actually

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,730
establish themselves within our

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:07,300
community it all started with open V DB

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,040
they were very early to submit their

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,170
projects and they were the first project

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,420
that we accepted for incubation so thank

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,070
you for DreamWorks for your hard work

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,200
there and all of the work you've done at

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,140
every step not only dreamworks of course

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,120
but the group that has formed around

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,500
open BTB they were the first to

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,740
establish themselves through the

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,020
governance processes that that we formed

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,840
in collaboration with the Linux

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,589
Foundation and indeed they are the first

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,540
project to graduate so

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,070
excellent news that we managed to in

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,290
that first year bring a project all the

00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,750
way from incubation through to a fully

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:52,000
active asws project so congratulations

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:53,380
tool and there be db2 and the project

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,519
really represents many of the things

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,339
that we've managed to do as a community

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,410
as well so they have done excellent work

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:01,630
in modernizing and somewhat

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,870
standardizing their make system around

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,880
CMake they have managed to incorporate

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,389
the CI system that we've been

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,920
collaborating on together also it took a

00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:13,570
path through circle CI which we're

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,820
exploring for a while until we settled

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,029
on as your CI which I'll go into some

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,610
details in a little while and we're also

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,050
seeing a good opening of potential

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,519
collaborations for a wider group of

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:31,209
people then we're associated with the

00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:32,410
project prior to its a SWF adoption at

00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,990
the bottom and I'll show this for each

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,440
of our projects this is your the

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:40,240
standard github contributions graph and

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,399
you can see in each case the time scale

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,319
varies but you can see that in every

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,069
case for all of our projects there's

00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:49,540
been a very clear and demonstrable

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:52,720
increase in project activity associated

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,370
with with the Software Foundation and

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,779
those projects coming on board that's an

00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,610
exciting thing of course we don't expect

00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:59,529
that spike to continue always but it's

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,510
wonderful to see that these key goals

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,240
just enabling activity and engagement

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:09,699
are very clear even with these high

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,829
level metrics next up up so make one

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:15,060
more point so open BTB are having a buff

00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:17,050
right after this meeting so an excellent

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,510
project to follow on and stay in the

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,100
room I'll be highlighting each of the

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,440
boss for our projects obviously there

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,720
are other projects which are not a SWF

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,430
projects which we're also supporting and

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,110
hosting in this space and that's another

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,760
theme that will we can touch one in the

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,220
discussions is how the role that the

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,800
foundation has to support projects not

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,769
only through direct adoption but also

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,839
through providing services and support

00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:43,230
to the benefit of those projects

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,230
separately

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,670
next up we have open Q's off this is

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,630
quite a different project from many of

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,640
the others it uses a different

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,980
technology stack as a render queue

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,520
manager with distributed components

00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:01,000
running from Python Java database and so

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,030
on they've done great work to set up and

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,470
establish a governance and technical

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,990
steering committee with a wide group

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:11,560
membership and they've also been very

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,380
active in bringing this quite different

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,590
shaped project into the SWF CI system

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,160
you can see as well that there's again

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:23,400
much shorter timeline but an excellent

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:29,170
build of activity as the process of

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:31,540
adoption through 2019 is occurred later

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,220
in the morning of course openexr this is

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,940
a project that needs absolutely no

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,950
introduction

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,750
and you can see indeed from the length

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,230
of that time scale how long this project

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,840
has been a part of and indeed the the

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:48,190
leading light for open source within our

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,510
industry and community as such an old

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,770
and established codebase of course

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:55,930
there's a lot of potential work to do to

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,070
bring new sets of developers up to speed

00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,650
and understand the history of that

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,770
project and there's been an absolutely

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:05,170
amazing display of energy and

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:08,080
integration to do things like modernize

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:11,400
the code base consider things that

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,570
otherwise were often discussed but

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,760
didn't really quite have the shape or

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:20,140
the environment to collaborate on like

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,190
moving from make to see make that's a

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,040
project that's currently in progress

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,630
within openexr another example is

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,880
looking at actually changing the

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,560
structure of the project where to

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,290
recognize the fact that ireland base i

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,570
math and opx are all actually serve

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,030
quite important roles and maybe

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,970
separating that functionality and

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:42,190
targeting those specific components for

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,390
more broader use is something that we

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:47,680
have a really opportunity to do as a

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:49,510
community again an excellent example of

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,930
wide contributions for a broad base of

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,930
contributors

00:15:53,589 --> 00:16:00,009
open cholerae Oh another long live

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:03,569
project that's been very become very

00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:07,269
well-established in our industry the

00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:10,029
timeline again shows a clear uptick from

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:12,009
a fairly quiet period of many years and

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,860
that project is extremely well advanced

00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:18,220
in the process of moving towards

00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,110
adoption they have governance and their

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,879
technical steering committee very well

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:26,800
established there's a very ambitious set

00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,189
of features and functionality for the

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,120
version to release which is primarily

00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:35,470
spearheaded by new contributions from

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,990
Autodesk and as with our other projects

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,059
that moved very well along in

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,879
collaboration with our other projects to

00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:46,389
establish the parameters for the ASW FCI

00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:50,249
a degree of shared and modernized see

00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:53,470
make and I think we can look forward to

00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:58,180
graduation for this project very soon

00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:01,269
they're in a very good place and of

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,129
course our most recent project of which

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,679
I don't have much detail yet but I

00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:08,350
encourage all of us to attend the both

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,980
in the early afternoon is open time I

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,360
know from Pixar so again this is a

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,659
brand-new project for the foundation we

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,589
accepted the project for incubation only

00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:21,669
a week ago and it'll be a great

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,750
opportunity for us at all engage with

00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:28,539
the project here while we have the

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:29,620
chance to do so face to face so I've

00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:31,120
lived with the projects because they

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,190
really are the most important part of

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,539
what the foundation does but I'll step

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,659
back a little bit just to explain how

00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:41,140
the technical advisory council functions

00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:42,669
in relationship to those projects and

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,799
indeed how the foundation itself also

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:46,990
functions so each of our projects is

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,309
largely autonomous and they have their

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,830
own technical steering committee and

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:53,320
governance processes that dictate how

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,120
that project is managed and evolved and

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,270
how contributions that other processes

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,679
work the technical advisory council has

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,510
representation from each of those

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,190
projects as well as the membership the

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,190
premier members of the foundation and

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,040
other experts within the industry so for

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,170
example we have

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,880
representative of the EVs technology

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,140
committee as an excellent pod of

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,500
correspondents with that community and

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,520
the VFX reference platform for example

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,830
as well as this sort of high-level

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,910
coordination role the TAC is an

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,530
environment for us to work on

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,210
essentially a common infrastructure that

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,980
is that serves all of those projects and

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,740
the prime example of that has been our

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,910
CI platform which I will talk to in a

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,750
moment that's obviously been one of the

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:35,030
headline goals for the foundation and

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:37,610
we've worked with great dedication

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,170
activity I think over the last year with

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,170
members of attack and also the broader

00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,480
community to really try and solve a few

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,070
of the problems that have been a to

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,900
larger scale perhaps for any individual

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:52,730
project to to solve on their own there's

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,160
a lot of detail in the slide and perhaps

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,270
this is something we can go into in

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,620
another context but I'll give you a

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,980
broad overview because I know this has

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,540
been a point of interest in and focus so

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,160
after some exploration with different

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,250
structures and strategies and trying to

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,650
understand how we can generate systems

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:13,000
which can not only work well in the sort

00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:15,080
of open-source context but can provide

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,270
examples and reference that could be

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,460
used in studio and other environments

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,040
we've settled on an approach which has a

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,110
mixture of these elements and should be

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,610
very familiar to general open-source

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,890
developers and highly compatible with

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,780
the kinds of for PR work clothes they're

00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,200
typically used in that context as well

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,790
as being able to to provide components

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,950
and reference examples for people to use

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:40,880
those in in other contexts like studio

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:45,650
environments so github of course is the

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:49,550
primary interface for for code npr's we

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:52,100
have used as your pipelines as our CI

00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,900
engine and that is partly or is in large

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,580
part because of its availability of all

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,610
of our target platform so we can serve

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,010
not only Linux but Windows and Mac

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:05,300
builds in that platform and we can also

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:08,750
actually easily use external resources

00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,700
such as GPU enabled machines or builders

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,590
which have specific license availability

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,600
for components which can't be run in a

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,300
more public environment easily from that

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,120
environment that's the dotted lines to

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,650
the side there

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,110
we're using Sona cloud as a

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:26,830
software-as-a-service analysis tool and

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,390
that feeds into some of the CII badge

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,200
the core infrastructure initiative badge

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,370
requirements that we've adopted to

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
ensure that we have best practice for

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,100
software development in our projects and

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,730
for security a vulnerability

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,720
identification and so on and we have a

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:45,310
variety of tools for us to actually

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,010
encapsulate and make efficient

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,720
configurations across our projects we've

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,010
explored a variety of techniques there

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,330
and we have the ability to use Nexus for

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,220
essentially more control than

00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,930
fine-grained artifact storage but our

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,760
primary means at this stage for projects

00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,260
is the use of docker to generate

00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,360
essentially base images and

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,610
configurations which can be used for

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,640
reproducible builds with the FX

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,250
reference platform compliance it's a lot

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,260
of fast words for all of our project

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,950
build so we're now being able to get

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:20,220
consistent builds across the somewhat

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,570
challenging I think as we're all aware

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,400
configurations that the VFX Restaurants

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,160
platform dictates for the Linux

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,170
platforms and we're spreading that to

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:34,300
the other platforms as appropriate at

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:39,540
the moment with that I will hand over to

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,540
Rob to set our gaze for the future

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,370
so I just want to pause for a second and

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,800
just recognize it this is less than 12

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,180
months of work we actually have a CI

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,130
infrastructure running we have five

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,570
projects in the facility in the

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,590
foundation and a number of others that

00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,360
we're going to talk about today

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,030
so I'm just really pleased at the

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,430
progress that all of you have invested

00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,930
and have made in the Academy software

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,670
foundation this first year it's actually

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,280
pretty remarkable we set some pretty

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,900
ambitious goals if you remember our goal

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,270
originally was to try to adopt three

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,070
projects in a couple months in David

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,410
Marin said let's make it six because

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,850
three looked too easy to do that several

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,280
months in and and here we already have

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,540
one project in full active status we

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,580
have several others that are in

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,740
incubation and moving forward very

00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,150
quickly so if you are part if you've

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,080
been a part of making some of that

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,040
happen could you just raise your hand

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,020
because I know that I feel a ton of

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,880
active developers and community members

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,140
here yes so let's give everybody a round

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,140
of applause who's made this happen

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,710
so we want to do more of that and this

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,910
is the interactive part I want to

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,590
especially thank for everybody for being

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,540
here at 8:00 in the morning to make this

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,450
happen so what's happening next where

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,550
are we setting our sights we did a count

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,080
according to everybody's agreements that

00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,450
they've already made this number will

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,050
continue to rise we have 15 full-time

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,910
engineer equivalents FTEs dedicated to

00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,490
the Academy software foundation's goals

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,230
and in the first couple years because

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,760
you know on the day that everybody was

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,470
signing their agreements and getting

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,180
started up we actually had zero projects

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,280
in the Academy Software Foundation so we

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,470
made this very general we said work on

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
anything that's open-source that

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:23,260
benefits the motion picture industry

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,200
right but at the end of this year the

00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,060
the language changes right and you have

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,010
to work these engineers will be working

00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:33,040
on Academy Software Foundation projects

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,660
so that's 15 full-time people working on

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,600
what today is five projects what

00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,490
tomorrow will be more projects and and

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,670
more but that's the minimum requirement

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,590
so if you were at an organization who is

00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,770
on that slide and you have a dedicated

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,790
engineer requirement there this is not

00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,650
something we're gonna spend a lot of

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,820
time auditing but this is something

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,070
we're gonna do spend a lot of time

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,810
celebrating all this engineering work

00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,680
that you are all contributing to these

00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,880
projects

00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,590
if you have your FTE or your full-time

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,970
engineer equivalent working on something

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,190
that is not one of these Academy

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,320
Software Foundation projects but another

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,420
open-source project in the industry this

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,760
is the year to think about transitioning

00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:15,070
them over finding the project that you

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,020
want to be involved with and then next

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,150
year at this time we'll be highlighting

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,070
some of that involvement in some of

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,860
those actual commits and changes that

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,210
we're making as not just to meet that

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,410
requirement meet or exceed their

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,380
requirement but also just to make a

00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:31,090
bunch of progress on these projects and

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,160
of course as we have more members this

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,230
number will continue to rise and this is

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,820
again a minimum requirement as you saw

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,680
from that commit those commit charts

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:42,520
we're having a ton of activity on our

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:46,360
projects already another goal going

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,130
forward we are incredibly grateful to

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,370
our premier members who have gotten us

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,140
to the budget that David was

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,610
highlighting the engineering resources

00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,760
and the commitments on the TAC and

00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:00,340
everywhere else now we want to diversify

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,480
our membership and include more general

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,460
members these are probably going to be

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,700
generally smaller companies that

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,740
wouldn't be able to spare the commitment

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,110
either the engineering commitment or the

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,910
money commitment to be premier members

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,890
but they want to be involved in this and

00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,930
we want them to be involved as well so

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:19,690
as you have ideas of companies who are

00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,900
into or leverage open source software

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:25,120
and want to become general members it's

00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,860
the general member fee is based on the

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,320
size of the company but it's quite

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,860
manageable most companies can do that if

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,150
they're interested and they basically

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,100
have a lottery for how they get

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,410
represented in the TAC and on the

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,390
governing board and there's it's a great

00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,150
way for people to be involved so we want

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,310
to really encourage general members to

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,050
get involved this year if you have an

00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,840
idea for a company that we should reach

00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:52,750
out to please find me or David Morin

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,040
David Marin after this and suggest them

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,120
and we'll we'll talk to them and see if

00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:01,030
they would be interested in supporting

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:03,670
us as a general member we've mentioned a

00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:05,730
couple times that open BBB is our first

00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,870
project graduating to active status

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,669
you're probably pretty familiar with us

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,279
by now but when we adopt a

00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:14,499
into the Academy Software Foundation it

00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,119
first starts in incubation status and

00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:18,700
there's certain requirements that have

00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:20,919
to be met in order to graduate to active

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,539
status so one of our goals in this

00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,099
coming year is to see more of those

00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,409
projects that you might think of as

00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:27,999
active things like openexr to actually

00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:31,359
become an active academy Software

00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:32,859
Foundation project that doesn't mean

00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,299
just that it's being used a lot in the

00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,619
industry of course all of them are and

00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,019
that is one of the requirements is some

00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:39,129
usage but it's also security

00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:41,409
requirements and a couple other things

00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:43,059
have to be ticked off or well on their

00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:44,259
way to being ticked off to graduate to

00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,209
active status so that's something you

00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:48,279
will see in this coming year

00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:49,690
next year we should be announcing or

00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,519
you'll see announcements throughout the

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,200
year but next year at this meeting I

00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,669
expect we'll have any more projects

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,139
several more projects in active status

00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:00,159
and a bunch more we have a governing

00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:01,629
board meeting tomorrow we're gonna be

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,820
talking about looking forward into the

00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:05,769
next year but I didn't want to miss this

00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,999
opportunity with all of you gathered in

00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:08,619
the room people who have are

00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:10,719
contributing and are active and smart

00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:14,139
people in our industry to poll you and

00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:15,369
to get your input since there's probably

00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:17,409
about a hundred and twenty hundred and

00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:20,679
thirty people in the room we have a

00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:22,629
high-tech way of doing this so if you

00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,700
have a mobile device or anything you can

00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:28,299
get on the internet with go there and go

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:31,239
to poll Evie comm / Academy Software

00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:33,239
Foundation a SWF and you can start

00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:36,359
participating it well it if this works

00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:38,499
it will live update on the screen so

00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,979
when we started the Academy Software

00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:40,389
Foundation

00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:42,759
thank you I'm betting that was David

00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:45,849
Marin the first one submitting his when

00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:47,649
we started the foundation we spent a lot

00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:49,929
of time talking about these three areas

00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:52,479
and these aren't the only three areas

00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:55,409
that we can work on as a foundation but

00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:58,239
I was kind of curious to revisit this

00:27:55,409 --> 00:28:00,209
about a year later and see what the

00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:04,179
relative priority is in your minds

00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:06,579
between these three areas so feel free

00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:08,649
to vote on you in this case you just

00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:10,029
rank the three areas and then submit it

00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:11,379
and I think you can even edit your

00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:13,629
submission if you did it wrong the first

00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:18,459
time I'll give everybody a minute or two

00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:20,259
to rank their priorities and this is

00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:22,410
binding this actually takes those no I'm

00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:25,770
just kidding it's not binding it's just

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:29,300
it's just good information for us to be

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:31,740
basing our planning on going forward

00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,190
David can you see how many people have

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,190
submitted

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,000
I think you probably already know this

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,650
but just in case you don't the

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,180
continuous integration environment and

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,920
that whole infrastructure that the

00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,800
Academy Software Foundation is building

00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,690
for our projects it's all being done in

00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
the public and it's all downloadable in

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,630
case you want to run that in your own

00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,610
studio or a business so the whole idea

00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:02,420
is the efforts that we all put in there

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,470
into the CI environment is able to be

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,910
leveraged by everybody

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:15,260
whether it's Academy Software Foundation

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:16,760
project or not we've done such a good

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,350
job on the shared legal framework it's

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,820
now the third priority which is good it

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,730
was one of the first priorities early on

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,140
it's great or it's possible we have more

00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,430
engineers and fewer lawyers in the room

00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,710
one way or the other

00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,950
that's where we're at right now great so

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,480
this one's interesting this is existing

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,650
open source projects out in the world

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,420
that you like and use by the way this

00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,980
one you get to put in your own what's

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,890
gonna happen is five people are gonna

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,300
put the same thing in so once you see it

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,810
up there try not putting it on again

00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,810
well there you go

00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:50,630
so just pick one of the Reza's too to

00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:52,460
vote on so once somebody is submitted it

00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,420
you can refresh your browser and you can

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,530
see the things that people have

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:59,000
submitted you can upload them of course

00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,320
we're gonna get five US DS and five

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,150
Reza's and the whole list

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:10,220
it's an IQ test of a hundred twenty

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:13,900
person IQ test at the same time it's

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,900
really just going to be USD and res

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,850
that is funny

00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,530
I should have just pre-populated it with

00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:32,250
a few that I thought were gonna happen

00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:33,780
so a couple things about the Academy

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,630
Software Foundation and how we approach

00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:48,150
this first we don't do any hostile

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:50,580
takeovers on projects there we go okay

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,929
open image is on there too so we don't

00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,340
do hostile takeovers on projects

00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:54,570
especially healthy projects if there was

00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,490
a project that was dead in the water

00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,440
that we all depended on we could see

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,210
what operation we could use but we

00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,559
actually haven't encountered that we we

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,300
have really good actors in our industry

00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:07,440
right now and that we don't see that

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,700
happening so the way this happens is we

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,660
have dialogue with the current owners

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,390
and we figure out what the right thing

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,720
to do is and the owners are the ones the

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,830
project the people who currently manage

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,650
the projects are the ones who would

00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,480
submit them for consideration for the

00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:23,160
Academy Software Foundation then that's

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,170
considered by the TAC and then ratified

00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,660
by the governing board so that's how new

00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:30,450
projects get submitted to the Academy

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:33,179
Software Foundation the other thing is

00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,770
while being about while software being

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,710
accepted into the Academy Software

00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,610
Foundation should provide everyone a lot

00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,020
of comfort that it's gonna have a

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,090
long-term future because we have this

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,679
big industry consortium who's come

00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,390
together and it's in basically an

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,350
implicit endorsement right that the

00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,070
software is important to our industry

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,600
and we want to see it continue um I

00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:53,070
wouldn't have it be a metric by which

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,130
you consider whether you want to adopt

00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,540
software or not many of us are in the

00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,610
business everyday of figuring out which

00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,920
commercial or open source packages we

00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,780
want to use and leverage heavily and

00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,150
rely on in our industry

00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,410
and I would argue that any open-source

00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,059
project is going to be a lower-risk

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,380
project for you than any commercial

00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,780
project right because you have a lot

00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,600
more control over its destiny if the

00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,770
original creator and maintainer were to

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,450
take it off the rails you could always

00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,820
branch it yourself if it's a suitably

00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,470
permissive license so open source in

00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,870
general is good for the industry so we

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,730
are not in a place as the academy

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,800
software foundation of wanting to be the

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,240
gatekeeper of all the open source

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,980
software that's in our industry we want

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,870
to encourage a thriving open-source

00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,120
community some of those projects Oh

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,350
maintained by the Academy Software

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,610
Foundation some of those projects

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,370
maintained by other folks

00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:43,140
if USD for example never came into the

00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,330
Academy Software Foundation and we

00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,130
heavily leveraged it in our industry and

00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,720
Pixar continued to do a fantastic job

00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,039
developing it that's a success story for

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,580
all of us and we would want to support

00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:56,220
that so but it is great to see the

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,169
interest in these projects up on the

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:06,830
board here everybody get a chance to

00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:09,000
vote I'm bettin bettin you did great

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:14,700
thank you for that list we will keep

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,340
this - so this slide is similar to the

00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,990
last one but instead of existing

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,789
projects that you know and love that you

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,250
would like to see adopted by the Academy

00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:25,919
Software Foundation this is new areas of

00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,460
development this is something like let's

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,559
say there was no open color i/o out

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,750
there and you had the idea of an open

00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,510
source color management system you can

00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,850
submit that here perhaps the Academy

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,769
Software Foundation this year should

00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,690
consider starting a project from scratch

00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:45,539
we haven't decided that we're doing that

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,769
but it's we could host something like

00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:49,080
that and it takes some of those

00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:50,519
engineering efforts that we can focus on

00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,440
our problems in our industry and our

00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,230
challenges and turn them towards new

00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,789
projects so feel free to submit your

00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,220
idea here and then I think you've

00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:00,600
noticed you can upvote or downvote the

00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,059
various ideas that people have submitted

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,480
oh could you imagine us doing naming

00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,480
standards

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:17,200
we've considered as we've talked a

00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,450
little bit about what we might do with a

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,309
newer project or a project bell from

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:23,230
scratch we've talked about maybe the

00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:25,149
first one that we consider not being too

00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:29,309
ambitious in scope but anything you

00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:29,309
think of here is really welcome

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,290
is there compositor with nine positive

00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,970
votes and a compositor with negative one

00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,240
just because we wanted to hide it let me

00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:11,930
get rid of these guys hello

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,930
so we've got it up above

00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:26,510
I don't know going back to the top I'll

00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,530
give that leave that up for one more

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:32,450
minute if you are standing the back and

00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,430
you don't want to stand there are some

00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,690
seats up in the front but you're welcome

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:44,750
to stand in the back as well where the

00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:47,630
food is with someone who submitted

00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:51,430
metadata want to describe what section

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,430
of metadata they were talking about I

00:35:52,450 --> 00:36:00,010
don't mean it's like saying stuff what's

00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:03,430
that to me to meta that's right

00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:05,960
no one wants to describe what the minute

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:10,010
ten people agree with you so you are you

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,510
are the second most popular topic maybe

00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:19,460
because it means ten different things to

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:24,200
ten different people cool great thank

00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:26,930
you guys it's great okay so this little

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,790
poll is designed to talk about areas

00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,670
that we might be able to focus on that

00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,620
are not explicitly about these projects

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,150
so things we might consider doing as the

00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,440
Academy Software Foundation because of

00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,060
our position in the industry and because

00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,830
of the group we brought together that

00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,970
aren't explicitly just about that list

00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,920
of projects that we were talking about

00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,570
so things like the CI infrastructure

00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,250
could be one thing shared across many

00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,830
projects there's been people who've

00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,000
talked about a home for certain kinds of

00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,640
datasets or those kind of things to

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,850
consider other things that we might want

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,710
to look at going forward that we could

00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,710
perhaps take on as a foundation

00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,450
oops sorry about that let me go back

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,270
oh boy

00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:47,119
I'd love to in addition to the

00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:51,410
leveraging the BFX reference and

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:53,029
platform in our CI infrastructure what

00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,920
would be another step for us on the

00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:58,430
visual effects reference platform in

00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:02,089
some of your minds do you want to dare

00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:04,039
shout out oh there's a mic for you go

00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:07,579
ahead go ahead

00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:09,859
okay I was just going to suggest the

00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,240
office thing is Windows and Mac because

00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:14,029
we don't really have that covered

00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,759
yeah add Windows and Mac to the existing

00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:18,500
visual effects reference platform for

00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:19,819
those many of you probably know the

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,250
visual effects reference platform is

00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:25,819
actually a effort by the visual effects

00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,849
society a ves tech committee that they

00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:31,640
updated annually they have a meeting

00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:33,559
Wednesday of this week to go over it the

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,869
new reference platform for Linux

00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,670
actually has the shift over to the new

00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:40,009
version of Python version Python three

00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,809
we're entering the modern era so it's a

00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:44,599
big change if you want to weigh in on

00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:46,910
that I don't think there's gonna be much

00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,829
pulling back on it we delayed it one

00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,990
more year last year I think it's gonna

00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:53,240
happen but feel free to show up in that

00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,470
meeting tomorrow you can does anybody

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,789
know the time for that meeting or

00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:00,049
location sorry

00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:05,990
and where is it do you know Nick so for

00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:07,339
12 3507 in the bin the great so be a

00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,980
part of that so that is a ves tech

00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:11,420
committee effort but in close cut and

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,069
we've been collaborating with them and

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,089
following and continuing to try to

00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:16,190
promote that together

00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:18,819
but adding Mac and Windows to that would

00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,819
be welcome

00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,630
what would across studio Universal

00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:30,670
identification system be this crestview

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:36,589
of goo ins is it for us video sorry

00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:41,170
it'll be very hard what is it metadata

00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:44,960
yes perfect we'll get right on it

00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:51,099
naming cowboy naming standards did not

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,099
get a lot of up votes I'm okay with that

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,020
convinced developers not to use GPL

00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:04,150
convinced good companies to use GPL well

00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:09,090
we have almost the same number of votes

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,090
[Laughter]

00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:16,480
hilarious great does anybody want to

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,099
chat about any of these we're doing

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,630
great and they're really appreciating

00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:20,770
but this is a really useful way of doing

00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:25,839
this thank you David for setting up this

00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:27,670
bowl so we have a full day

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,750
you guys know where to participate

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,010
you're here you already know where to

00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,440
participate you've already found us

00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,650
encourage other people to find us online

00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,750
to sign up join our communities aisle we

00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,550
try to do almost everything or I think

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,670
we do everything out in public so you'll

00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,480
see all of our notes all of our meeting

00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:46,390
conversations all those things these are

00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,550
all public record you can join in and

00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,230
and just to be clear whether you are

00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,119
whether you work for a company that's a

00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,950
member organization or not you can

00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,270
participate in the Academy Software

00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,490
Foundation of course by using the

00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,530
software which is free or contributing

00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,730
to the software which is free or

00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,230
branching the software you can do

00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,910
anything you want with our permissive

00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,400
licenses or just about anything you want

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,890
quite a lot with our permissive licenses

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,299
yeah so everybody can participate in it

00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,280
and of course we're still looking for

00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:13,390
more members as David says the next

00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,130
member gets to be the one who pushes

00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,140
over a million dollars so that's going

00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,059
to be super exciting for the person to

00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,170
come the group to come in after Apple

00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:25,599
which we're very excited about them

00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:27,069
joining as well so unless there's

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,150
anything else what I think we've got

00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:30,250
just a few minutes before our next

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:35,140
prison presentation did you want to say

00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:36,730
anything to wrap us up here David great

00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,549
why don't we do a couple minutes of Q&A

00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,839
with this group any Daniel do you mind

00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:43,119
coming up to so we can feel the

00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:45,490
questions together and any questions

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,079
about this opening session and then in a

00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:49,299
couple of minutes we'll turn it over so

00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,829
our next presenter can set up and we can

00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:54,700
get started on the birds of the feathers

00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:56,680
on good morning as you're thinking about

00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,900
your question I also want to recognize

00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,670
that John muriatic is in the room here

00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,010
from the Linux Foundation in the back

00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,170
many of you who have interacted with the

00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,280
foundation are interacting with John

00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,960
both John and

00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,490
they are helping us from the Linux

00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,680
Foundation along with a lot of other

00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,660
people from the Linux Foundation to

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,880
operate the Academy Software Foundation

00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,310
we got a lot of benefits from their

00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,500
experience we continue to have it every

00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:23,200
day emily is doing a fantastic job with

00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,700
all of our events and PR and John is

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,950
helping us with a lot of our internal

00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,720
process and benefiting from the

00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:32,620
experience of many other projects that

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,110
the Linux Foundation has with us so it's

00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,760
been a really great can't emphasize

00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:39,760
enough how the Linux Foundation helped

00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,370
us to get up to speed the reason we're

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:51,460
here today that much achieved in that

00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:54,520
one short year is thanks to them yeah I

00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,320
thought the beers of a feather last

00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,550
night was a good example how many of you

00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,300
got over to the beers of the feather a

00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:04,780
handful a good handful so that's been a

00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:07,720
grassroots event that's mostly been led

00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,340
by Larry grits over the last five or six

00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,280
years since we started doing a lot more

00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,960
open source on our industry and last

00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,030
night you may have noticed the Academy

00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,280
Software Foundation ran that event for

00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,810
us first year that Larry had more fun

00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,220
than being nervous figuring out how to

00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,020
collect everyone's credit cards and make

00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,130
sure that the event got paid for was all

00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,890
managed by the academies Norfolk

00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:29,140
foundation hopefully that what last

00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,460
night is like is a good analogy for what

00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,750
it's like to have stuff in the Academy

00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,150
Software Foundation it was like a little

00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,940
better organized it was a little better

00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:39,580
funded we had beer for longer and and

00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,800
the engineers people like Larry got to

00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,700
relax and enjoy the environment a little

00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,710
bit more rather than running around

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,970
correct collecting credit cards but

00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,590
basically it was the same event

00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,110
hopefully it felt like the same event

00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:52,300
that we've had for the last five or six

00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,010
years so hopefully that's what a good

00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,660
analogy for what is like if a project

00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,340
joins or if you're getting more involved

00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,900
in the Academy Software Foundation just

00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,290
you know just the same as it was just a

00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:04,090
little more beer it's a good sign of the

00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,160
commitment to from so many of the

00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:07,570
audience that they went from beer late

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,980
one night to breakfast early the next

00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,630
day

00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,130
exactly something that's been very

00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,770
enjoyable to say actually is how much

00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:25,950
enthusiasm and goodwill there has been

00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:28,830
over the first year with blender mm-hmm

00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:30,930
so far the softwares of middleware type

00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:33,540
software x here from blender I also work

00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:36,570
with blender are there any plans to

00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:40,980
start supporting or looking at user

00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:43,560
front facing software in user GUI stuff

00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,060
as opposed to middleware any official

00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,670
roadmap or is it just something that's

00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,670
eventually will be gotten to or where

00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:52,830
the thoughts on that please yeah from my

00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,920
perspective there is no nothing

00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:57,330
prohibiting us from doing user facing

00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,150
software with gooeys that the user act

00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:03,480
the users are actually diving into so I

00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,070
think our biggest need that we felt as a

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,810
community was that some of our

00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,630
middleware software was showing some age

00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:11,250
and some of it wasn't getting the kind

00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,950
of healthy maintenance that it needed

00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,940
the continued to be widely adopted so I

00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,280
think that's one of the reasons we're

00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,650
seeing a lot of these first packages

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,720
being middleware like that I guess you

00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,540
could say open queue is a user facing

00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,880
application it has gooeys it you know

00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,250
gets direct user interaction but it is

00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,540
like a layer removed from something that

00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,760
you're going to use to make the final

00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,520
pixels on the screen but definitely

00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,320
nothing prohibiting us from diving into

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,380
broader applications that are going to

00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:44,190
be gooeys and and DCC apps and those

00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:47,369
kind of things very happy to have the

00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:50,820
blender foundation as a member and and

00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:52,530
Tom is here and the blender foundation

00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:55,710
is already an organization that has a

00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:57,810
lot of support and and it's doing a lot

00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,680
of activity Tom if you want to tell us

00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:05,460
about what you're doing it at SIGGRAPH a

00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:08,040
little bit here to communicate to our to

00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,570
our group so I missed a little bit the

00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,670
question but you get know if you want to

00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,630
just tell us what you're doing and what

00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:15,090
are you

00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:18,780
so I love of course very happy to be a

00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:20,970
member of the Academy I'm feeling a

00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:24,270
little bit like the old man out because

00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:26,760
we are not the movie industry and we are

00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:29,160
not really in the movie industry but I

00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,960
already said I don't really want to have

00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,590
planned in Hollywood but about Hollywood

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,020
and branded meaning everybody in the

00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:39,720
world should be able to make fantastic

00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,270
content and awesome games and a 3d

00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,930
graphics because we all share that

00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:48,000
things were making movies making games

00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:50,430
making things with 3d technology and

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,470
kaboodle classics and that's our passion

00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,810
and I think we share that and I'm

00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:57,390
incredibly happy that the Academy

00:46:54,810 --> 00:47:00,630
Software Foundation takes care of all

00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:03,360
the very important open source libraries

00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:06,240
and all of them are in blender and we

00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:13,230
benefit to an ambitious one - thank you

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:15,210
guys yesterday right that's great -

00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:21,030
thank you for being a member that's

00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:22,890
really appreciated any other members

00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:25,590
