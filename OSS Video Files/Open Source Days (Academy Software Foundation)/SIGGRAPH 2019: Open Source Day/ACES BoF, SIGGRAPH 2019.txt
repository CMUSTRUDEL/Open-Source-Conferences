hi people thank you for coming to the

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:09,389
Asus birds of a feather I am Annie

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:12,000
Chiang I the asus project chair we've

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,679
got a packed agenda today of all kinds

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,170
of things of updates and things that are

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,390
going on and everything like that so

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,550
we're going to go ahead and get started

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,619
just so you know this is should be super

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,480
interactive so please we have mics in

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,769
the room so go ahead and raise your hand

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,150
if you have questions or you just want

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,849
to say something or blurt it out it's

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,529
fine it's all good so I'm not going to

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,809
cover all that but you'll see we're

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,860
gonna have updates from different groups

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,290
and what's been going on so basically we

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,270
are here to update you on the progress

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,809
that we have been doing over the last

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,030
little bit confirmed that we are

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,500
actually fulfilling your needs so we do

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,050
need to hear from you so make sure

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,120
you're I mean I'm not I'm I don't think

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,640
you guys and girls in the room are

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,180
actually very non vocal so feel free to

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,379
speak up because I know you are and then

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,830
we do want to ask for your participation

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,560
and help here because this we are going

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,729
to talk about Asus 2.0 and we can't do

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,979
that without you and your help so almost

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,630
a few important things to mention we are

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,409
really actually making some progress

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,509
here on Asus so it's cool we have been

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,390
coordinating with the OCIO group so

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,950
please stick around for OCIO in the next

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,110
birds of a feather they have some

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,619
updates as well on the Asus side of

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,509
things and we've been trying to open up

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,659
sorry trying to operate in an

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,150
open-source type of manner and we do

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,040
want to thank the a SWF for giving us a

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,939
slot at this birds of a feather day

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,710
although we are not part of the a SWF

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,930
yet we are trying to work towards that

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:55,860
towards that goal there so so thanks to

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,860
the a SWF for having us and these slides

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,509
will actually be posted on Asus central

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,329
after this presentation so you don't

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,380
need to take notes or anything so let me

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,299
talk to you a little bit about the

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,099
progress first and then we'll jump into

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,420
the updates from the virtual working

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,630
groups that we have

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:16,410
we actually have a process so we based

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:18,330
our new structure on how a SWF is

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,940
actually running since we figured in as

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,070
a SWF was getting going we would

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,830
actually keep work going and so we would

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,390
try to mimic what how Linux Foundation

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,870
does you know a lot of their their

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,760
principles of running their groups so we

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,210
do believe that the fact that we did

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,640
announce Asus 1.2 later this year will

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,770
be proof of the fact that stuffs does

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,780
seem to be working you can go to this

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,830
link here and you can check out our

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,860
governance structure that we have and we

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,910
do have some new groups to announce here

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:56,130
but as I mentioned we were actually very

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,620
structured around how a SWF is so we

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,020
have created two technical advisory

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,420
committees one for architecture and one

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,730
for implementation the architecture

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,770
group is really looking at code and

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,770
specifications around all the components

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,660
for ASIS whereas the implementation TAC

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,250
is really meant to actually look at how

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,709
those specifications are actually

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,510
implemented in products so we want to

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,450
make sure that you know there's a good

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:26,360
consistent manner of how we're actually

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:28,950
providing those those those products and

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,380
and we have working groups underneath

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,660
those technical advisory committees the

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,700
tacks are actually made up of volunteers

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,410
from the industry so we have a whole

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,130
bunch of people that we are thankful for

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:43,230
for coming together for that and let's

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,550
see here so we at the speaking of the

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,880
progress so you're gonna hear a little

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,680
bit from Chris and JD of what's been

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,480
going on with the the current working

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,230
groups but we do want to announce the

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,440
fact that we have decided that because

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,390
the specifications for CLF and ASIS clip

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,030
are starting to really get formed here

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,440
the revised versions we actually want to

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,690
start moving that into the

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,580
implementation side so we just formed a

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,790
couple of implementation working groups

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,010
to go along with CLF and asus clip oh

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,480
darn it the actual okay well that's all

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,169
right I see what you're talking about

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,950
don't worry about it that's a teaser the

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,350
asus metadata file here

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,750
about that we switch slides around so

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,810
that's why we didn't catch that okay

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,210
anyway so thanks to Doug Walker for

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,740
volunteering to chair the CLF

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,550
implementation working group you're

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,110
going to hear more about the

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,860
implementation groups from Jay Z in a

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:44,340
little bit and then thanks to Dan titute

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:47,920
from marquita to chair the Asus clip

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,590
implementation group we also have three

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,840
working groups that are just in progress

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,300
that we're actually trying to spin up we

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,710
have a group looking at IDT's we're

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,660
going to having a group that's looking

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,190
at the gamut study groups both of those

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,260
are actually we're looking for chairs

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,350
for those groups although as of

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,560
yesterday we may have found two like a

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,690
couple of co-chairs for the gamut study

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,080
group so hopefully that'll get going

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:17,290
soon and then thanks to Jay Schulte for

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,790
chairing what will be the compression

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,050
group so if you were in the openexr

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,630
there were birds of a feather earlier

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,300
there was a little question about

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:30,280
compression in the asus TX ARS and so

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,170
this group will actually be taking a

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,680
look at that and hopefully defining some

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,150
best practices and then you may be out

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,380
there thinking huh you know we should

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,380
actually have some other things we need

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,290
to do for Asus so please just make a

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,060
proposal there's a proposal form we can

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,590
send that to you you can you there's

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,920
there's links on it and everywhere you

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,750
can get get to it but you can feel free

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,240
to make a proposal for any kind of work

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,370
that you think needs to be done we just

00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,720
ask that you have some proponents as

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,280
well so it's not just you by yourself

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,920
but there are other people that are

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,540
interested in the work and so that way

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,870
we can actually start that as a group

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,080
and have some work yet to go all right

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,240
so now I'm gonna ask JD Vandenberg from

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,850
Disney to come up here he is our chair

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,920
of the common let format no come on come

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,970
on I'm just going to talk while you walk

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,380
so no you're fine

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,880
and he's going to talk a little bit

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,230
about what's been going on with the

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,380
virtual working group on CLS Thank You

00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,380
Annie

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:41,620
all right so who knows about what CLF is

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:45,370
about here Wow okay that's cool so I

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,990
want to just explain again a little bit

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,250
what was the goal of the common lot

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:54,970
format CLF it's an XML based file format

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,580
that can represent 1d lut 3d lut three

00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,180
1d lut matrices ESC CDLs and you

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,760
actually note that we have introduced

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,410
its we're trying to cover most of all

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,210
the spec even the original spec is

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,520
trying to cover most of the existing a

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:13,240
lot file represents a trend position

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,280
types namely the different number of

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,600
coding encoding systems like floats or

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:23,470
integers 1012 bit Hal floats etc and CLF

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,350
is also node based so you were still a

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,840
few actually able to break down a lot

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,870
into is it's different component instead

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,730
of having to crush everything into say a

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:40,300
3d lot which is usually the case what

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,680
the command format is not and I want to

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,510
insist on that because I think there's

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,300
some confusion is that it's not a

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:49,780
specific Asus Transformer file format

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:54,970
it's been launched by the Academy as

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:59,710
part of aces what five years ago three

00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:02,520
to six months ago what 1010 what no it

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,520
started 10 years ago

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:14,920
okay but it's not related to ASIS so you

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,120
can use it with you within your project

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:22,000
being part of Asus or not so what we've

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,520
done is that we looked at aspects we

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,540
formed as a virtual working group and we

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:31,960
met online we went through the specs and

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,340
all of the ideas we rejected a lot of

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,599
the specs and then we put it back on

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,190
because we realized later it was

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,020
actually a good idea and we added some

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:45,040
some of the most notable changes that

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,680
the the there was a real interest in

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,120
adding parametric transforms to make

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,790
sure that we have the highest possible

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,800
precision and we picked some of the most

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:59,230
common which is which are the log and

00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:01,840
exponent we also shaved off a few of the

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:06,040
most complex part of the CLF format that

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,240
may have not been super useful I

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,430
shouldn't say that but it was very

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,870
contentious but we realized that index

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:18,190
map should be limited to two two

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:21,190
dimension two and we finished that part

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,490
of the work we are right now actually

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,280
actively rewriting the specs and you all

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,360
welcome to join it's on overleaf using

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,200
latex it's awesome

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,830
we even meeting in real face-to-face

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:39,100
which is unheard of I think it's speeds

00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,050
up the process and and so the next step

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,240
after that is going to start a little at

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,670
the same time but dog-walker is going to

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,650
work on the implementation and do some

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,230
plugfest and that's going to be super

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,000
interesting because that's where we're

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:57,520
going to be able to try to break it and

00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,290
improve it so that's it for CF so now

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:05,760
I'm introducing Chris Chris Kroc who is

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,760
going to talk about AC skip

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,480
thanks JD hello everyone I'm gonna talk

00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:15,889
a little bit about Asus clip how many

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,920
people have heard of Asus clip or know

00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:23,899
what it is a lot of you Wow ok cool

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,000
that's good so it was kind of spoiled

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:32,300
before so I'm gonna jump right to that

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:37,670
slide and then go back but Asus clip is

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:41,449
now called Asus metadata file so I have

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,339
a thought I thought there would either

00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:47,180
be cheering or like tomatoes throwing

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:49,639
around but so why was the name changed

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,170
well a lot of people when I started

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,600
working on this group when I talk about

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,160
Asus clip they'd say oh so that's

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,529
something you playback it's a clip of

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,959
images I said no it's it's actually a

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,970
metadata file so we thought why don't we

00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,069
just call it an Asus metadata file it

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,250
makes for kind of a nice acronym AMF

00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:08,480
could be a file extension and we don't

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,230
have to explain ourselves every time

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,850
we're talking about it so this was we

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,990
went through a lot of different ideas

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,079
for the name

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,559
there was a poll within the Advisory

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,529
Committee and Asus metadata file was the

00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,899
the clear front-runner of that poll so

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:28,490
that's the name and the full details of

00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:33,379
that whole process would be documented

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:36,110
in 1.2 but back to where we are so at

00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:38,750
NAB we presented we were part of a group

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,550
that was the requirements group and that

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,800
was really going back to look at what

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,000
are the real requirements for a metadata

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,360
file that goes along with an ASIS clip

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
see there we go

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,899
so a shot that goes to be effects comes

00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:57,109
back or a shot that moves through

00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,939
dailies you know Asus as a framework is

00:11:57,109 --> 00:12:00,379
great that it standardizes the encoding

00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:03,049
and how to get in and out of it but

00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:05,720
there was this missing part of you know

00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:07,239
how do I describe the look of the LMT

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,439
that goes along with this how do I

00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:12,079
contain the CDL that might be associated

00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:13,790
with this or even just the Asus version

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,679
number that is associated with this shot

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,169
so those are the main parts of the

00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,879
requirements gathering what are the base

00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:22,669
things that we need to know about a shot

00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,040
in order to view it properly so that was

00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:26,569
completed we have a workspace where you

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,389
can check out the requirements that we

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:31,429
gathered and now what's underway is the

00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,230
specification review group where we're

00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:36,980
going to actually complete this

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,739
specification for Asus 1.2 and Alex

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,049
Forsythe is is kind of the co leader in

00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:45,619
that group and helping to define the XML

00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:47,929
schema and everything associated with it

00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:52,459
the third group that's going to start in

00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:56,419
the implementation side of the of Asus

00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:57,499
is gonna be chaired by Dan tattooed I

00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:59,839
actually don't know how to pronounce his

00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:03,769
last name he's going to chair the

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,419
implementation group and focus really on

00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:13,369
how this thing's implemented across

00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:15,230
software so the first thing that we all

00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:17,389
need to know what we're receiving an

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,480
ASIS shot or sending one out is how to

00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:22,459
view it and that's the basic basic

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,629
requirement number one of the Asus

00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:29,449
metadata file is what's the if it's not

00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:31,999
in Asus encoded image how how should it

00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:35,119
get into Asus or the IDT if there's an

00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:38,419
LM T I can be stored in what we call an

00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:43,779
LM T stack so you could have a CDL a 3d

00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:47,059
lut basically a stack of LM T's and

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:50,989
describe the RT and OD t that are used

00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:52,339
or the output transform so again these

00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:54,709
are things that could travel out with

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:58,429
VFX shots so that software could know

00:13:54,709 --> 00:14:00,930
how to actually display it for you and

00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:04,439
there is an existing spec

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:07,019
that came out with Asus 1.0 but in

00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:09,029
talking to manufacturers during the

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,869
course of forming this group if we felt

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:16,019
like the existing spec was really robust

00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:17,459
and and in a certain way complex enough

00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,589
where it was hard to implement so we

00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,290
kind of tried to strip it back and start

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,209
with something much more simple and just

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:30,019
add to it things that we felt were

00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:33,119
required and we also discussed areas of

00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:35,490
the industry that this could have travel

00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:37,559
being adopted and what we could do to

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:41,639
help in that area that's a big focus for

00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,470
the implementation group so again we're

00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,139
generating the new specification which

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:49,139
is ongoing and you can check it out it's

00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:52,139
actually on Alex's github and we're also

00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:55,819
writing in latech specification on

00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:58,889
overleaf similar to the CLF group and I

00:14:55,819 --> 00:15:03,059
really I feel strongly that this is a

00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:04,470
big part of Asus that it can it can

00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,269
really automate a lot of those things

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,550
that people manually have to set up and

00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,889
we have lots of different Luntz

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,800
floating around and if we contain these

00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:17,160
things into a really really nice sidecar

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,490
file that's kind of agnostic to camera

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,620
or display we can really streamline

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:30,329
color management across the board so

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:33,779
that's it thanks everyone and I'm

00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:35,279
introducing Jay Z yo Keem zel from eFilm

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:37,589
who's going to go through and talk about

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:43,000
some of the implementation focus groups

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:46,600
that are starting up thank you Chris

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,029
let's see and talking about color

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,399
accuracy did you realize that the font

00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,970
of our presentation has the same color

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:58,829
as Oscar all the imaging science people

00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:01,540
in the room please confirm yeah so the

00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:03,699
implementation virtual working group I'm

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,550
very happy about that we have this group

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:09,850
what happened in the past that a group

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,860
of crazy rocket science type of people

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,470
did invent something gave it to the

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,740
community and then normal working class

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,779
people like me put a picture solar

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,310
system look at it and thought what the

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,620
hell what were they thinking

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:26,889
so like the crazy rocket science people

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,259
like 50% of this room and the normal

00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:31,750
working class people like the other 50%

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:35,319
of the room we come together now so we

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:37,240
have this virtual working groups the

00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:41,439
implementation virtual working group

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,319
then implements the functions and

00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:46,329
procedures developed by the

00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:48,490
architectural virtual working group we

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:51,220
of course have a feedback loop there is

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,309
coming and going depending on if it was

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,559
working or not if normal people can use

00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:58,689
it we keep it as it is and if we don't

00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,600
understand it there's a communication

00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:04,559
pass we're gonna have a soft start of

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,510
this virtual working group so wild

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,809
architectural group is still working on

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,510
it

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:13,589
the implementation group starts looking

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:16,650
at the documentation already the real

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:19,539
handover will happen when the complete

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:22,270
documentation is ready the implementers

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:25,329
take it on the implementers are all the

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:29,860
usual players in the VFX world in the

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:32,169
diee color corrector finishing area on

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:36,429
set color corrector so many of the

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:41,659
vendors and a product partners will be

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:43,940
part of this group the next one is

00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:45,919
yes so the the members of the

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,409
implementation group virtual working

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,549
group may be the asus product partners

00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:54,980
asus implementers end users and instead

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,110
of having a plaque fest where everybody

00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,870
comes together we're gonna have

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,509
reference images circlings through the

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:05,720
community confirming a before and after

00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,799
and taking care that everybody gets the

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,830
same result

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,309
what is mainly the same the main

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:16,129
function of Asus as I see it that across

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:19,039
the world in different time zones or in

00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:22,129
January March and December in Africa

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,679
Europe and America we all can do the

00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:29,029
same thing but using different tools and

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:32,269
reference images will help us to do a a

00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:35,720
OOP to confirm that the images are right

00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:41,000
so I'm looking forward to this new group

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:43,820
as part of Asus and thank you for dark

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,389
and then for taking on the two first

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:52,480
implementation working groups of our

00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:52,480
project and then I give it back to any

00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,730
okay so I'm gonna stop here for a second

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,440
and have there are there any questions

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,399
about what you guys have already heard

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,269
so far

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:08,190
oh yes Belinda hold on a second I think

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:12,990
there's a mic coming towards you I know

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:16,620
you're loud though but it's okay I had a

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:19,259
quick question for Chris I wanted to try

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,860
and better understand what the verticals

00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:24,450
are the different areas of our business

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:35,460
were that we're going to have difficulty

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:38,789
with the implementation it's a good

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,649
question I don't know if I can name

00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:43,049
specific parts that will be more

00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:47,129
difficult than others I would say our

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:49,019
focus is going to be on first getting

00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:53,460
them to exist in the first place which

00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:54,809
means you know on set you know live

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,809
grading scenarios where you're creating

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:59,669
a look and people are judging images we

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:03,960
want to capture exactly how those images

00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:06,539
are viewed in a in a metadata file so if

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,999
we can get people making onset color

00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,889
software or camera manufacturers to

00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,710
generate these things that we can get

00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:16,499
daily software to track them through to

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,049
the effects polls and through red TI and

00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:22,139
and kind of just maintain the look

00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:23,960
throughout so I don't know we'll find

00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:27,119
out which ones are the most difficult

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,490
but I think for those of you in the room

00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:33,210
who make products I think it's important

00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,649
to get involved and if see if this thing

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:43,289
is useful to you and how you would

00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:44,759
implement it so anything else okay we're

00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:48,899
gonna move on to just some of the

00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:51,210
roadmap things so ASIS 1.2 you heard a

00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:54,059
little bit of that from from Kristin I

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,429
think JT about that and I think Joseph

00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:58,320
yesterday said you Annie you said that

00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,679
this was releasing in September of this

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,230
year

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,759
I I hate to sound like a politician but

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,419
I don't recall saying that I'm pretty

00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:07,860
sure I said fall this year so yeah so

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,070
we're still aiming though for this year

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,590
to release 1.2 so what we're looking

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,260
forward to for 1.2 would be this new

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:18,870
seal left specification the new asus

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,110
metadata file specification with the

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,850
versioning support and then also this

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,240
will be an interesting discussion item I

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:30,690
think is the inclusion of being able to

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,679
do non ASIS grading spaces and then also

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:36,630
the custom LMT application space support

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,070
via the Asus metadata file I'm gonna

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,600
have a really hard time saying Asus

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,410
metadata file I keep wanting to say Asus

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,990
clip but I can buy a beer for whoever

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,790
you know every time I say Asus clip that

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,730
didn't count

00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:54,090
okay so yeah so this is what we're

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,950
looking for for the 1.2 release coming

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,070
up this year is there are there any

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,590
questions we mentioned this back at NAB

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,790
so I think everybody if you if you had

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,250
an issue with this you might have

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:08,280
already brought it up to us by now all

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,660
right all right but if you do I mean if

00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,490
you have any questions or concerns I

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,179
mean feel free to just come up and chat

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:17,340
with us we're very friendly people so on

00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,929
to the next big meaty topic which is

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,970
something we did actually talk about at

00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:23,460
the NAB birds of a feather but we want

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,590
to bring it up here again since this is

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,440
much more intimate than everything and

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,860
the idea is this asus 2.0 which we're

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,290
hoping will actually launch next year

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:36,299
this is the the meaty stuff that we've

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,740
we've been hearing about for a long time

00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,240
that we actually really want to try to

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,790
see if we can have these improvements

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,740
upon so the features would include a

00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,960
simplified RRT

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,700
the parametric output transforms which

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,460
we have a little bit of that already in

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,919
the asus 1.1 but this would be the fully

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,370
featured one some parametric dim

00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,830
surround support for the ambient

00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,960
lighting and then a production-ready

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,520
reference implementation that would

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,830
actually include interchangeable

00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,740
programmatic LMT format and an

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,419
interchangeable IDT formats and then of

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,270
course we're always striving to do

00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:16,670
better and user documentation

00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:19,220
hopefully this this aces 2.0 will also

00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,530
address some of the gamut mapping issues

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,140
that we've all seen some people know it

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:27,560
as the airy blue problem or the negative

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:30,020
value issue or other fun ways to

00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,230
describe it I'm just going to go forward

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:36,590
one slide and I'll come back to this but

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:39,410
basically jay-z rod and I had done a

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,060
year-long listening tour just meeting up

00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:43,820
with people that worked with aces to get

00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:46,100
your feedback about the issues just to

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,930
remind you these are the top 10 and we

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,860
are actually trying to address I think

00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:55,760
all of them in this 2.0 version or the

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:59,540
1.2 version so I'll just bring this back

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,850
to here anybody want to discuss anything

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:07,210
questions concerns

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:15,200
Oh Joseph shlump qey where's the mic

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:17,690
here it comes a minute so I was

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,560
wondering if there's any wider interest

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:24,860
for a large format ASAP roll this film

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,240
still matter film does matter actually

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:30,950
we've been discussing a little bit about

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,630
the film side and the ADX stuff so we

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,610
don't have it listed in here but I know

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,260
we've gotten some feedback about it so I

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,600
think we can we can talk about it for

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,400
sure would you like to volunteer and

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,400
maybe make a proposal and chair a group

00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:53,840
come on man

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:55,700
we'll see we'll talk but no I think film

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,660
does matter we've actually had this talk

00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,970
about the coming in from film and then

00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:06,800
also writing out to film and perhaps

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:09,140
this need to be revisited what's up you

00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:16,120
might not need to J Schulte but some of

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:16,120
us do why CMS okay

00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,999
I was gonna ask what is program of

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:33,369
programmatic LM T's they

00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:35,379
containing code are they executing so

00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:37,570
right now there's no mechanism to

00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:39,849
transport LM T's in a sort of controlled

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:44,139
way most people are just packaging them

00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:45,970
up within a 3d lut we like to explore

00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:48,759
the possibility of doing something that

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,279
is a little bit more analytical than

00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,519
just a big cube to represent some sort

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,869
of look and some standardized way of

00:25:54,519 --> 00:26:00,039
moving them from system to system

00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:07,629
we're still trying to flush these things

00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:12,369
out but that's the basic idea same thing

00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:15,489
right so if you if you're on a resolve

00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:18,340
for example and somebody says well I

00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:20,200
have a new camera and I have an ID T for

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,580
it and they hand you a file I mean what

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,679
file are they handing you there's no

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:27,489
standardized mechanism to move an ID t

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,190
from one system to another system what

00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:39,999
we want to do is look at you know some

00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:42,399
way to interchange these transforms want

00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:46,599
to say all this file formats then are

00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:49,090
managed by a Asus meta file so the Asus

00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:52,090
meta file will be the key differentiator

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:55,210
or the key explainable part which then

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:57,999
picks up on the LM T and the custom ID t

00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:01,989
if there then is one so it all comes as

00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:06,849
a package this J first and then dot o

00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:08,470
are we so I got one more a quick

00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:11,409
question about I know I'm so fun to find

00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:14,009
working group chairs for the IDT in the

00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:17,200
gamete management but any any idea of

00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:19,629
when those if those chairs are assigned

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,700
when those will start well I think we

00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:23,979
may have identified the chairs for the

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,379
gamut study we think we'll have to just

00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:28,029
confirm that and so that could actually

00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:30,279
get started pretty soon we just need to

00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:32,169
confirm I think the proposal that was

00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:33,700
actually created the proposal has been

00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:36,580
actually just to give everyone

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,410
transparency originally har old from re

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,360
actually created a proposal

00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:43,810
but he actually was not able to chair it

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,300
and so we had actually talked to Justin

00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,040
Johnson over at luma who was interested

00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,360
in doing it but then wasn't sure he

00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,880
could actually chair it either but he

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,820
actually had done a revised proposal for

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,830
it so these new chairs that we are

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,540
looking at I need to pass on the

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,580
document to them and take them take a

00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,020
look at it but it should be pretty soon

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,090
because we really want to get going on

00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,880
this because the asus 2.0 effort

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,190
actually all I think hinges upon the

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,230
gamut study because we don't really want

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,360
to create a new you know that we're the

00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:16,540
reversible arty for example without

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,770
having the the gamut lockdown yeah cuz I

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,350
kind of feel like those two are kind of

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:23,830
interconnected and and related or is the

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,320
IDT what what is distributed as far as

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,430
best practices as far as communicating

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,350
when these IDT's are rolled out

00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:32,070
specifically like is there involvement

00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:35,830
with the camera manufacturers directly

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:37,180
jay-z and I think we may have I haven't

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,650
talked to these other people about this

00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,230
but I think we may have identified a

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,680
chair for the IDT group so that might

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:49,030
actually be moving quickly too so in

00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:51,010
December 2016 we all met with every

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:54,100
camera manufacturer on the market at

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:56,530
Panavision all cameras got penalized we

00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,050
we shot all cameras next to each other

00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:03,930
and found out what the differences are

00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:07,030
even after the existing IDT's are used

00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:09,790
the result of this that at the academy

00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:12,040
we did build Esmeralda a sound stage

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:15,010
where we have controlled lighting and

00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:18,250
then can test all these cameras and the

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:22,000
cool function will be that 18% gray is

00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:24,340
18% gray after you did implement the idg

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,470
because the cinematographer has a light

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,240
meter you tell the light meter

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,850
what's the frame rate what's the shutter

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,520
angle you tell the light meter what's

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:36,250
the sensitivity of your film stock or of

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,830
your camera setting 800 a is a you

00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:41,920
measure 18% grade in the light meter

00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:44,260
tells you set your aperture to for

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,840
example a T stop of five point six and

00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,600
when all this goes together based on the

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,120
light meter the 18% gray card should be

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,250
18% in ASIS linear light

00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,780
and that was defined already in the

00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,760
beginning when the first IDT

00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,000
documentation came out but it's still

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,190
not a case so some basic functions are

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,010
not honored by the camera manufacturers

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,830
and then we want to also define what are

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,440
the cornerstones for the color gamut do

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:14,830
we want to give the absolute capability

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,890
of the camera and then ASIS ap0 as a

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:21,100
reference or do we want to give visual

00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:24,820
red green and blue as it is normal as a

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,560
reference so dead-set the IDT virtual

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,620
working group will also define what

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:33,190
allowed tolerances are and at a moment

00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,860
we are kind of off but talking positive

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:39,340
when you use the existing IDT every

00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:42,760
colorist will be able to do normal RGB a

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:46,840
sec DL offset settings to bring them all

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,820
into a normal standard but so it

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,950
actually what I said earlier on we

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,870
didn't have the implementation group yet

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,120
there was only the architectural group

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,300
and this is actually a good example that

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,850
the implementation group was missing

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,780
confirming that everything works after

00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:09,010
it is done so yes so the IDT group is

00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:12,280
one of my personal it get me gets me

00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:14,830
personal excited and we gonna work on it

00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,830
to have it either sooner than later in

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,800
place I was actually hoping to announce

00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,690
them actually that they were ready to go

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,390
today but they're not but we'll get

00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:30,070
there really close very soon Mike thanks

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:31,540
I think J and then dato J oh sorry that

00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,030
someone had them like so one of the

00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,670
things that we hit a lot is that CDL and

00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,440
saturation aren't quite compatible in

00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,220
some of the wider gamut color spaces

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,200
that we work in

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:46,690
I blame Josh so can we put that as

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,210
something discuss either at the ASE

00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,520
level or Asus level to accommodate a

00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,430
means to be you know gamut and primary

00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,770
aware when effecting saturation through

00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,240
standardized means like averaging or you

00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,950
know

00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,740
I referred saturation calls as opposed

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:06,240
to brute hammer yeah it comes Josh comes

00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:09,690
Josh no this is a known thing so part of

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,520
the the other evil group the ASC

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,900
technology committee that's changed its

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:18,480
name to Asus clip I think since that

00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:21,210
name is no longer taken no but we

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,700
realized the existing CDL saturation

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,620
coefficients were you know vetted on

00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,480
existing working spaces and stuff they

00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,750
certainly seem to break with certain

00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,730
transforms to a p1 so we are doing some

00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,620
preliminary work whether just changing

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,360
those coefficients is going to solve the

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,140
blue issue or not we're not we're not

00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,270
sure but certainly there is possibility

00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,570
for updating that in the CDL the bigger

00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:48,570
problem there if we roll out a ASC CDL

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:50,580
2.0 is how long is that gonna take to

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,380
get implemented and sent out but I have

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,720
a feeling if it were as simple as just

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,810
changing the saturation coefficients we

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,940
would have done it so but testing done

00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,410
on the on the blue LED problem has shown

00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,410
that it needs more than just different

00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,750
coefficients but very valid point ok and

00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,100
then to extend that you know I think

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,720
we're slowly getting into an ecosystem

00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,310
where we're gonna need a file for a file

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,320
to describe another file and another

00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:15,360
file part of what we're trying to get

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,570
down from is the well I can't look at

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,700
this because I'm missing a file so what

00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,830
is the overbearing thought about you

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,140
know trying to not so much standardized

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,340
as unify where this all lives as opposed

00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,800
to having you know replicated

00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,540
functionality and all these files

00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,180
because if I look at the interchangeable

00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,160
programmatic LMT format what's to say

00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,980
that couldn't live into something like

00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,750
the you know comment let format as an

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,160
extension of that and if I take that see

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,440
a left world and I put it into visual

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,300
effects we have obviously i/o which has

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,650
all those numbers under the hood and if

00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,760
stick around for a Mark's presentation

00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,560
or two there's some other fun things

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,510
there that could be very appealing so we

00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,520
know having you know feature duplication

00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,010
between two industries ie post finishing

00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,630
and visual effects that's one of the

00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,430
things I'm not quite sure we're all

00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,750
super happy about so it'd be great to

00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,090
have those kinds of talks at the bigger

00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:06,210
forum to figure out what do we do what

00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:08,500
do we think cool ok I know you Ju will

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,470
remind you or remind me about this so

00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,629
good alright dad oh so interesting I

00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:17,379
actually had the same remark like so

00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:20,590
easy is a asus metadata file going to

00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:23,590
allow us to embed you know like you know

00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:25,540
any any kind of you know one big curves

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,909
or CL apps into it or we're gonna just

00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,280
reference to them like when you say oh

00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,200
this is the description so we if it's an

00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,970
accustomed IDT like you know you're

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,710
proposing in version two then how we're

00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:46,300
going to be able to track that you know

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:51,220
IDT with a with a metadata file yeah so

00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:54,609
right now everything is referenced so we

00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:58,869
had that conversation up front and felt

00:34:54,609 --> 00:35:00,730
like sticking the entire CLF itself

00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:03,570
inside of a newest metadata file would

00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:08,020
make things a little bit unruly

00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:12,520
eventually so right now it's just the

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:14,530
transform name so that would be like Jay

00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,400
was saying kind of another file that has

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:20,410
to reference so and has to have certain

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,060
location and and how we're going to

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,550
manage this location if we end up with

00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,260
ten thousand Clips you know throughout

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,089
the dailies project I'm just thinking

00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,589
like we should start thinking about it

00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:32,050
straight away like you know is there

00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:33,190
maybe and maybe even a database approach

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,440
or something like that

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,130
yeah that's what we deal with already

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,180
right

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,410
we have lots of CDLs or lots or things

00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,660
floating around that have to be

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:46,030
associated with shots so we're already

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,220
dealing with that with data management

00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,930
systems and databases and things so I

00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,930
think this would just be a standardized

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:54,820
way to describe those things okay

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:57,550
and my next question is like you know I

00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,410
I have been asked about but a few of my

00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,060
clients you know I love the open source

00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,250
approach but some of my clients are

00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,099
quite adamant that we need to protect LM

00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,839
T's so is there a like an idea that

00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,780
we're going to start you know getting

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,589
some like Asus file encryption for lmds

00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:16,990
and CL apps

00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:18,840
I mean well it's he's gonna kind of you

00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:20,490
know show and explain hey you should

00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,470
be lucky no copying and sending these

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,570
files unless you really like smart - how

00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,220
to break it but you know I think there

00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,160
should be some sort of flag that should

00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:32,490
kind of protect you know as some

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,100
property inside that file we actually

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:39,990
hmm I'll answer that but just quickly

00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:42,870
back to what Jay was saying we dog

00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:46,320
walker was I don't know easy here he was

00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:48,870
oh hey Doc he was helped a lot with the

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,210
CLF revision of the specs and the

00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:53,280
discussion and he's gonna chair the

00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,470
implementation group and a lot of

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,490
discussion was about the scope of it you

00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:02,070
know he OCIO has all these amazing

00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,790
features and a lot of parametric you

00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:08,010
know definitions and and at some point

00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:10,440
we had like okay we're gonna stop here

00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,540
but we could also encompass this and

00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,420
that but what I was trying to remember

00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:18,240
is that at the very least I'd like to

00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,980
have a way that when I receive a lot I

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,170
can read it when I send you a lot you

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:27,270
can read it and we don't have to try to

00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:30,420
guess which one of you know feature of

00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:32,760
cube or three DL or whatever it is and

00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,250
say if we can achieve that it's already

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:41,070
great and you don't have to support the

00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:43,110
entire or CIO Library for a manufacturer

00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:45,360
or software developer to be able to do

00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,800
that so that's the goal now will it be

00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,290
superseded by something else in the

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,930
future like maybe that would be great

00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,510
but I think that today there is a need

00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:57,240
to simplify this and then other

00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:00,180
conversation we had who is in the group

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,040
and some of my colleagues is you know it

00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,200
would be great to like break down a lot

00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,460
a little better than just put everything

00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,080
in just one transform and and also be a

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,000
little closer to a hardware

00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,790
implementation in some cases even though

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,030
like we still have to transform that to

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:20,640
the specific FPGA programming usually

00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,350
there's some you know parsing in and and

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,450
reorganizing of the of the bits but

00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,160
because we support endanger integer and

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,460
everything we try to get closer to that

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,690
as well

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:34,070
I hope that's answers but back to the

00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,260
it's funny because when I was a

00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,270
technicolour before Disney Josh and I we

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,250
had this exact conversation because we

00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,170
realized that a lot of di TS were

00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:45,200
keeping around some of the transforms

00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,090
that we were giving like and then they

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,770
were like oh I have all these film

00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:54,350
transformed are available for other

00:38:48,770 --> 00:39:00,950
productions I think I was I was a

00:38:54,350 --> 00:39:03,050
proponent but I think it's if you have a

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,250
mechanism actually that you think would

00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:08,510
work for that I would be interested

00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:10,250
beyond like encrypting the file because

00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,380
do you want to be generated key and then

00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,350
oh time bombing maybe we were talking

00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:21,380
about that for okay Josh ooh you should

00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:23,900
answer that because your upper

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:26,300
management at various places I've worked

00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,160
I've had this idea of oh they're gonna

00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,520
come up with these looks and market them

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,220
and sell those special looks and stuff

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,890
and they'll encrypt them so that they

00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:40,100
can't you know unfortunately there is no

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,360
way to encrypt a 3d lookup table or

00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,540
anything in any way that it can't be

00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,670
simply reverse engineered so it's a

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,530
pretty difficult it's a it's a difficult

00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,590
problem unless you get the actual

00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:53,210
platforms to do the do you know if yeah

00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,790
if it's just at least you can't emulate

00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:59,290
a 3d look like you pass all the nodes as

00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:59,290
an image and then you generate back

00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,720
it's gonna be the simulation side of

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,520
things right so if we're gonna simulate

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,560
this through a code that's modular or

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,900
what we're talking about it's not gonna

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,500
stop anyone from reverse engineering and

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,450
if they really want it to so is it an is

00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,470
it an indemnity thing more like on paper

00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:25,950
we're good because we've got the button

00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:28,770
if you use clf3 plug and then you

00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:32,480
actually define you transform by like

00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:36,120
very precise using parametric and of

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,690
theoretically infinite precision you

00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:41,370
will only be able as far as I know to

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:47,520
emulate like a lower quality version of

00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:50,130
that now I know but you won't be able to

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,560
like tweak the shape a lot at the

00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:55,050
beginning only right you won't be able

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,820
to disassemble it into its places and

00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,770
then and then turn the knobs as it were

00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,510
so maybe maybe in that case there is a

00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,250
case I'm just being a devil's advocate

00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:05,370
maybe there's a case for it you know

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,840
like you will have low like um yeah you

00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,730
won't be able to disassemble it and then

00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,020
just like if you have an ACC DL in the

00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,930
middle of all this you won't be able to

00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:22,470
just tweak that for instance it could be

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:25,050
interesting okay and then we'll get to

00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:27,540
mark I would say at whatever you do if

00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,250
you decide to use encryption at no point

00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,380
should it ever stop a camera from

00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:34,380
functioning and or DPS from being able

00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,840
to see their work on set so if at any

00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,610
point the encryption version of your LM

00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,380
T's stop a production you're probably

00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:44,730
gonna find yourself not working on that

00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:47,250
production thanks Joseph good common

00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,530
wisdom go ahead more yeah it's gonna ask

00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:52,350
with the Aces metadata file we were

00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:54,000
talking earlier about taking information

00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:56,100
from say onset grading teams and how

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,390
they're applying CDLs and then passing

00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,910
that down the pipeline to post

00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,680
production but one of the things I found

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,540
it at least all the major post

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,700
production VFX facilities I've worked at

00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:09,330
is none of us are using the official

00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,940
aces OCIO configs or color space names

00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:12,930
everyone's rolling their own

00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,940
interpretations of how things should

00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:18,240
work in their pipelines so I'm wondering

00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:21,150
if you're tagging names of color spaces

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,310
how is that possible to come down the

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:30,060
pipeline in a way that's mapable and

00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:31,980
you're reusable this is not a setup so

00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,260
this is one of the exact reasons why we

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,990
didn't embed specific files as opposed

00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:40,860
to referencing files via transform IDs

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:42,450
because there's lots of implementations

00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,240
of these transforms and as you move from

00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:47,700
system to system there's there's

00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,580
transforms the the the exact embodiment

00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,710
may change so on one system you may have

00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:56,120
a 3d lut and on another system there may

00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:58,560
be a GPU and and you're gonna certainly

00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,050
cause issues if you start passing the

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,440
actual transforms yeah just add to that

00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:06,990
I think we we still have work to do on

00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,020
how we actually defined non ASIS working

00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,790
spaces so one example on a real show

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,910
that you know Josh was part of the group

00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:17,970
and shared a kind of example of what an

00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:21,090
asus clip would look like and the CDO

00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:24,630
was applied in log c not basis or asus c

00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:28,580
CT or or any asus color space so how do

00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:32,370
you describe log c in in the asus system

00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:34,860
there's of course in IDT for log c but

00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:37,830
how do we describe how to go in that in

00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:41,640
and out of log c or another color space

00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:44,640
so I think both CLF and asus metadata

00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,300
file have been trying to avoid making an

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,310
enumerated list of all the color spaces

00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:53,160
but we do need some some of the common

00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:54,670
ones to be accessible as a working space

00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,309
so

00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,380
I kind of actually wanted to ask the

00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:00,910
floor at that question because I think

00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,930
there's a lot of smart people in here

00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:08,849
and you know one of the ideas we had was

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:11,920
Asus CSC color space conversion

00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:15,359
transforms going to and from some of

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:22,599
these common non Asus working spaces I

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:24,819
saw a hand that Joseph I thought I

00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:28,750
remembered putting all of the e I

00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:31,329
specific log C transforms into the OCIO

00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:34,390
config right that there's the Python

00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:38,740
code to generate those yeah yeah and I

00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:41,410
and at your request the size of the OCIO

00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:43,119
config file ballooned up crazily because

00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:47,650
you wanted precision to like the seventh

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:50,079
decimal place yeah so Josh Joseph you

00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:52,720
made it very easy for for the log C

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,150
functions I think it's just what other

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,329
ones do we include and and how do we

00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,059
keep that up to date as new potential

00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:03,400
working spaces come out in the future I

00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:06,190
think actually I just I think if we

00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,380
could if you interested I wanted to

00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:13,180
tackle that for like a few years now is

00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:14,890
if we could come up with just and I

00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,750
wanted that to be part of the annex of

00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:20,140
this year left but I got some push backs

00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:23,140
but if we could just come up with a

00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:24,819
nomenclature of and that's where the

00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:28,119
trick is the most common color space or

00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:30,910
how to extend that if you want to and

00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:34,630
say for instance you know if an Iowa

00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:36,460
gamut Loxy you just call it that that

00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:39,039
way and that would save us so much time

00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,559
also as part of the CLF when you go in

00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:44,200
and out of color space it's the case for

00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,990
ASIS but it's not the case for a lot of

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,150
the most commonly used color spaces in

00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,470
general so you know the least of the

00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,660
three primaries when it's three

00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:55,119
primaries the transfer function and the

00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:59,680
white point if you could like find a way

00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:03,670
to do to a naming convention about that

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,289
that to save my life I was gonna say

00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,860
it's all like there's certainly places

00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:09,470
in our VFX pipeline

00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:11,120
where we might not want to use the

00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:13,670
transformations that a client has used

00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,290
so maybe they've applied a certain luck

00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,790
that they're using for the color space

00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,590
for their grading but that's not

00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:21,230
necessarily the best luck for us to use

00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,820
for linearizing film stock footage or

00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:25,760
something like that and so we'll

00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:28,550
frequently do our own our own pipeline

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,260
to get for the effects working spaces

00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:32,000
but then have to come back out to

00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,240
accommodate grading pipelines and

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,860
grading workflow it's upside-down Oh in

00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,200
addition to that though I was gonna say

00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,150
it it feels like the problem is kind of

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,880
coming from the wrong direction like to

00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,410
me it seems more like we should be

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,420
ensuring that the onset grading teams

00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,610
are working in a consistent and standard

00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,160
space rather than wasting time trying to

00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:53,510
encode all the different potential color

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,760
spaces they could be grading in why

00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:57,830
don't we kind of ushering them more to

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,660
to grading in CCT and solving their

00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:03,890
problems with are you implying people

00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:06,920
onset waste time and so ja I think I see

00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:10,370
Josh like an HP actually so yeah it's 61

00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:14,540
X if you can convince the DPS to do that

00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:18,170
more power to you they won't so the vast

00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:21,710
majority of basis shows that we've done

00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:24,650
do not for our world work in any of the

00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:27,140
asus grading spaces but the two things

00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,980
there is yes of course the VFX folks you

00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,600
should be able to bring it in to

00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,830
whatever your working space is what we

00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,380
want to be able to provide you as a

00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:34,910
foolproof way of going oh if I do this I

00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,170
can generate a QuickTime that matches

00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:38,420
dailies because that's all that

00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,520
editorial cares about and you shouldn't

00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,900
have to worry about that it should just

00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,640
be you know that should fall off the

00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,960
truck very very easily but yes you

00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,110
should be able to work in whatever space

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,610
you want likewise the DPS and the

00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:51,290
colourists are going to want to work in

00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,360
whatever space they want to work in so

00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:54,980
the the same argument I think the main

00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,170
thing here is there was a discussion of

00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,870
do we only allow a certain enumeration

00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:01,430
of allowed working spaces or grading

00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,980
spaces you know pick all the cameras

00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:07,610
stuff or oh geez a new camera came out

00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:10,420
and you know red came out with their

00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:12,980
14th different color space this week

00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,020
because making sure no from companies

00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,700
and

00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,590
and then it's like okay here's a new one

00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,120
we have to support how do we get that

00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,560
out there how do we enumerate that how

00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,930
do we release that and then it gets into

00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,510
the product so I think if there is an

00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:28,520
enumeration of existing ones that's why

00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,740
we're gonna have to be able to have oh

00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,870
new camera came out here's the custom

00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:38,210
IDT a way of distributing it so that

00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:40,910
production can proceed but in terms of

00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:42,950
trying to get the the creatives to work

00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,420
in a different space that they are may

00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,400
or may or may not be comfortable with

00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,710
that is going to be an uphill battle so

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,600
to your point Josh and I think to your

00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:52,040
question I don't actually think there's

00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,660
a real solution this problem other than

00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,570
elbow grease like when I was putting

00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:59,000
together the OCIO config I did a sort of

00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:02,360
a trawl of the ICT the IDT's that were

00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,070
in the CTL repo and then I looked at the

00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,900
set of cameras than spaces that were

00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:08,330
being widely used and I had to go out

00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,780
and reach reach out to read reach out to

00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:13,550
all the various manufacturers and say

00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:16,460
the IDT that's there is nice but we're

00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:18,740
missing XYZ spaces please help and that

00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,720
was a you know a month long process of

00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,700
building up the trust and the you know

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,140
the communication and frankly when the

00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,750
new camera comes out when the new space

00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:28,100
comes out there's not there's not an

00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:30,110
automatic that's gonna happen to make

00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,750
those spaces available you kind of just

00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:35,270
need someone who's dedicated to updating

00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:37,160
either the OCIO config with the

00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:39,470
transform functions and the gamuts or

00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,930
you know whatever other way you want to

00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:44,000
embody those transforms I unfortunately

00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:46,990
that that my message would be there's

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:54,670
just work there Thanks

00:49:46,990 --> 00:50:00,339
yep Kevin yeah yeah yeah we'll try Kevin

00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:02,020
will have the last say how's that but

00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:04,359
thank you this has been very good that's

00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:07,420
good good discussion for sure so I'll

00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:10,000
start by apologizing before I turn this

00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:12,730
over and people go oh yes um we're

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,220
talking about IDT's what about the fact

00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:19,410
that some manufacturers produce say

00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:21,099
ProRes file where you need one set of

00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,900
interpretation of whether it's narrower

00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:24,250
or full range and then when they do the

00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,570
raw format it's something different and

00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,099
so the ID T's don't necessarily apply

00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:31,570
depending on the actual format you get

00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:34,510
given you're gonna drop that bomb on us

00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:38,550
right now it's like five minutes left to

00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:38,550
go Halla joints first no no that's okay

00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,670
I'll just summarize this by saying join

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,910
the groups and the discussions because

00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:51,880
frankly this is all great discussion and

00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:54,220
these are all real points and issues

00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,880
that that that we have discussed some

00:50:54,220 --> 00:51:00,790
degree and and and we're continuing to

00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:03,369
discuss but we have meetings weekly on

00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,869
these topics and they're phone calls

00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:06,460
that you can call into and they're

00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:07,990
recorded on the internet in case you may

00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,200
sit miss a weekend

00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:14,109
you can you can catch up but please

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,450
participate because participation really

00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:21,310
is ultimately how we move to a new

00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:23,650
version of a system in particular Kevin

00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:25,780
and a few other people in the visual

00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:30,099
effects industry when we released Asus

00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:31,599
1.0 brought to our attention a lot of

00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:34,540
things that worked and a lot of things

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:37,000
that didn't necessarily work for their

00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:40,089
facilities and their workflows and what

00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,400
we did was we went point by point it

00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:46,270
through a lot of these and some of it

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,339
had to do with just our process and how

00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:51,369
it was we were communicating the

00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:54,220
information as we were making decisions

00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:56,650
but what we did was we went through and

00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:59,260
and tried to address each of those

00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:00,720
points point by point so really your

00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:04,980
participation is career

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:07,980
ultimately to shaping what asus 2.0 is

00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:10,500
going to be so again these working

00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,590
groups are happening on a weekly basis

00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:18,960
they're all announced on Asus central

00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:21,210
comm and really you can participate at

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,300
any given point just by calling in to

00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:27,690
the to the meetings and they're all

00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:32,070
hosted on GoToMeeting and we continue to

00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:33,270
to you know try to make things better at

00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:35,910
this point I think I'm gonna hand it

00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:42,810
over to rod who's gonna sort of

00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:45,599
summarize okay there you go so again

00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:47,010
thanks everybody for coming and part of

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,420
what alex is saying and in fact i think

00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,700
what we've been in saying the entire

00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:54,150
time is the work gets done because

00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,950
someone does the work and the more of

00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,980
you that help us do the work the more

00:52:55,950 --> 00:53:01,230
work that gets done and so when we talk

00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,450
about these things of there needs to be

00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:07,230
a working group and somebody needs to be

00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:09,930
a chair be the chair it's okay is it

00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:11,880
turns out secretly all you have to do is

00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:14,220
organize stuff the other people do all

00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:20,310
the work so the chair is the good job so

00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:24,330
I recommend that you try that so so this

00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:26,010
actually is we call to action be part of

00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:28,200
what we're doing because what we're

00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,640
doing is working it's already working

00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,050
and I think that's the important message

00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,210
and one of the reasons that we wanted to

00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,400
speak to you today is that we've got

00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,560
work that has succeeded and it succeeded

00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,109
because the involvement of individuals

00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:42,240
who chose to chair and gave us proposals

00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:43,980
that were explanatory of what problem

00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,080
they were trying to solve and then those

00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,480
problems were in fact solved by the

00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,430
group of people on Asus central and the

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,540
people that came to the meetings so if

00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,310
all you want to do is come to the

00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,619
meetings please come to the meetings but

00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:57,540
if you are able to chair we would like

00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:59,550
for you to write up what that thing is

00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,030
that you want done and so Joseph you had

00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:04,730
a good list of things that you want done

00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:08,099
yeah write it up right in that thing

00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:11,359
yeah and actually I think that's an

00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:13,440
excellent point is that some of these

00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,480
nothing is too small nothing is too

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,700
large whatever that

00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,579
excellent quote is there are things that

00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,290
are if it's just a narrow small issue

00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:23,270
that needs to be addressed but it can be

00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,349
written up as a small issue let's write

00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,609
it up and we can have a small group

00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:27,079
about it because the idea is that these

00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:29,089
things are not supposed to be persistent

00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:31,010
we don't want these groups to last for

00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:33,440
months in four years we want them to

00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,329
finish what they're doing and dissolve

00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,829
and move on to another thing because we

00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:38,510
also know that the people in the groups

00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:40,400
are working on many of these

00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:42,200
simultaneously so we don't want to

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,490
overwhelm them but as much as possible

00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,020
let's pick them up and put them down and

00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:50,810
get through these items and try to get

00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:54,000
ourselves to Isis 2.0 applause

00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:54,000
[Applause]

00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,170
alright thanks folks for coming to the

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,440
birds of a feather please stay tuned for

00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:07,450
open collar i/o which is next up and if

00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,100
you do I mean I think there was a really

00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:11,680
good conversation so I'm gonna try and

00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:15,540
keep this going if we can somehow so

00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,540
thank you and please participate

00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:19,000
