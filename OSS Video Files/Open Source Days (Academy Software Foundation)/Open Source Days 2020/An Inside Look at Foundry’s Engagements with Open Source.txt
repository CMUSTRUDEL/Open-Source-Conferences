Foundry tools are a key component of many production pipelines, and our adoption of open source projects is a big part of that. In this talk, we’ll cover what open source tools are most significant to Foundry and why, including OpenEXR, OpenColorIO, OpenTimelineIO and USD. We’ll also cover which open source projects are of emerging interest, and how Foundry manages the dynamic between commercial software development and nurturing of critical open source components, including updates to the VFX Reference Platform.
