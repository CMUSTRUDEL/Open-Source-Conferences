Foundry tools are a key component of many production pipelines, and our adoption of open source projects is a big part of that. In this talk, we’ll cover what open source tools are most significant to Foundry and why, including OpenEXR, OpenColorIO, OpenTimelineIO and USD. We’ll also cover which open source projects are of emerging interest, and how Foundry manages the dynamic between commercial software development and nurturing of critical open source components, including updates to the VFX Reference Platform.

hi everyone um thank you very much for

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,040
attending the session today um we're

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,480
here to talk about foundry's engagement

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,719
with open source

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,840
and what we're really hoping comes out

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,520
of this presentation

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,960
is a a different perspective or at least

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,080
a deeper perspective about how a

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,800
uh major vfx tool vendor like

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,359
uh foundry actually works with open

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
source

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,679
uh both in terms of delivering it to

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,440
customers and internally and also how we

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,960
contribute things to the open source

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,559
community

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,280
um i'm uh my name is matt i'm the

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,840
director of product for new technology

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
at

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,039
foundry and i'm joined today by my

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,120
colleague rob hi i'm rob fanner

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
i'm engineering manager for our platform

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,079
group where i look after

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,840
core and shade technology engineering

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,039
teams

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
great so um let's uh let's kick it off

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,440
with

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,479
uh a a kind of a controversial statement

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,439
um you know if you've got the your

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,760
preconceived notion that you know

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,119
commercial companies are mainly all

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,600
about shipping

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,640
proprietary tech that's you know the

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,000
myth we're

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:25,040
we're busting today really foundry

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,960
uh has a very uh very intimate and

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,400
strategic relationship with open source

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,680
at several levels so that's kind of what

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
we're going to talk about

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,600
um today in detail um but

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,320
first more importantly is why does open

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,079
source

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,119
matter to foundry and that's really a

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,320
question for us

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,720
that we uh answer at two levels

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,920
um the most important level uh for us

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,399
obviously is

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,159
uh is for customers if open source

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,799
matters to our customers

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,479
and therefore it matters to us greatly

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,520
but more specifically

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,560
uh what customers really want is

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,439
maximum pipeline ability um studios

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,079
uh you know pipeline developers people

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,879
who

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,800
build tools in the heat of production

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,920
really need to be able to work with

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,959
software

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,959
and tools that have the the greatest

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,520
ability to fit into a pipeline

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,959
with lots of other pieces um you know

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,879
foundry's tools are just

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,040
you know one citizen among many that

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,160
make up a production pipeline

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,280
and keeping the uh you know keeping a

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,599
really

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,200
strong focus on the overall pipeline is

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,160
important to us

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,560
and it's also about compatibility with

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,800
file formats tools and libraries

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,319
uh when you know vendors introduce

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,720
formats or tools or

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,319
things that have to uh you know that

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,519
aren't at versions that are compatible

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,599
with the other

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
tools or file formats that folks are

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,000
using it causes

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
uh it causes a lot of pain and we do our

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
best to

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,680
keep things as compatible as possible

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,519
and related to that is it's all about

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,800
keeping a low barrier of adoption

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
familiarity

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,480
when our customers pick up uh pick up

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,400
our tools

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
and need to kind of change their mental

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,480
model or

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
uh you know have big sort of uh semantic

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
hurdles to get over

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,239
it just you know it causes a lot of drag

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
and reduces their ability to

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,280
focus on the aspect of you know

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
delivering

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,040
creative content so we try to avoid that

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,120
as much as possible

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,480
but we also have selfish reasons for

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
working with oss

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,959
and one of them is we don't we don't

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,680
want to reinvent wheels um there's also

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,440
really great

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
uh wheels up there in the open source

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,319
world and already made

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,519
and uh we want to focus on being able to

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,080
uh to augment those or build around them

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,360
or just fit them in and build the rest

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,720
of the car and not worry about the

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
wheels

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
we also want reduced maintenance and

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
onboarding overhead

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
you know the onboarding overhead is

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,400
actually really important when we

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,480
look at talent or people with certain

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,120
skills that we want to bring in to help

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,680
develop our products uh folks who have

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
worked with

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,959
uh major open source projects or open

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,040
source of any kind

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,799
really bring a super valuable skill set

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
to the table and they bring

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,120
uh you know a certain readiness in terms

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,639
of their skill set that we can

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,919
we can take advantage of to get them up

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,280
and running really quickly so that's

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,440
super important to us

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,880
we're also looking at a desire to have

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
efficient and industry standard

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,600
infrastructure

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,680
uh robert will talk about this in more

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
detail as well but you know we use open

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,040
source to make

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,639
our own um to make our own software

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,560
development processes tick

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,160
and that's really important in order for

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,080
us to remain efficient

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,199
and uh agile and respond to changing

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,960
changing market needs so

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,120
um what look what you know what does our

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
overall shape of our engagement look

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,680
like uh we kind of see it at three

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,840
levels

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
uh one level is you can think of foundry

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,919
as

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,800
uh you know an entity that sort of ships

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,639
open source

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,600
uh uh libraries and systems

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,800
uh with you know our tool set kind of uh

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
encompassing those

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,720
so we heavily integrate open source and

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
open standards into our products and

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
uh you know we'll go into that in more

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,160
detail it's really about

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,680
uh like i said before maximizing

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
pipeline interop

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,240
also our products are really heavy on

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,440
having open and flexible apis

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,199
and very often those apis uh relate to

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,639
or depend on underlying open source

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,320
systems so

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,400
that's a really important aspect for us

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,039
to pass that uh

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,520
that simplicity and interoperability on

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,600
to

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,280
uh to people who are using our tools and

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,840
integrating them in the pipeline

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,759
uh we use open source our internal tools

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
and processes rely on open source

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,199
um and interestingly we'll talk about

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,400
this a little bit later we also have a

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,680
long experience

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,000
uh working in the cloud space and a lot

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,240
of experience using open source tools

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,919
uh related to cloud services so that's

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
an experience that we've had

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,919
as a company that we hope to build to

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,080
bring to bear in the future as well

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,440
and finally we are contributors to the

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
open source community we have a long

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,919
history of contributing to open source

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
projects

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,240
uh and we have a github uh many github

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,280
repository or several github

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
repositories

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,880
with tools and projects that folks can

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,319
make use of and you know i think on the

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,840
contribution side that's where we're

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,720
really looking to the future and looking

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,600
to

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,199
really increase our investment so we'll

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
be talking about that a little bit more

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,919
as well

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
so i'll pass it on to robert talk a

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
little bit about how we ship and use

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
open source

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,520
so robert why don't you tell us a little

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,800
bit about what

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,720
goes into foundry products right so

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,880
next slide matt we use a lot of open

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,039
source software uh this line here

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
is just one of one or three of our

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,319
desktop applications and a subset of the

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
open source using them

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
both in the production and and that's

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,280
finely shipped

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,960
um when we look at the software as a

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
service of clouds sort of neck of the

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
woods

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,800
there's a lot more of these libraries

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,800
and the font gets really small

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,080
um so enough about that matt will

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,440
continue that later

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,840
matt next slide so as matt said

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,360
um for us the pipeline ability fitting

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
into the larger ecosystem

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
what our customers use is extremely

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,560
important so from that perspective

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,160
robust apis makes this possible so if we

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
haven't got features for it then

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,319
customers can roll their own

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,440
integrate what they need and move on um

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,280
compatibility

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,199
is very important for us as well so the

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,880
vfx reference platform has been great in

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,440
terms of that so version night has be

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,120
gone

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,039
we can pick common software version

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
focus or software and make sure that

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,520
it's easier to integrate across

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,280
pipelines

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,880
open formats are very important for our

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,639
customers and so it's important for us

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,960
so alembic open xr

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,280
open colorio these are supported almost

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,160
universally across our portfolio

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,479
we're also looking at usd it's currently

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
sported for importing into katana maori

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,800
and nuke

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,759
and there's much more to come in that

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,280
space it's also worth just touching on

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,840
open plug-in systems in the value that

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,599
they bring

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,080
things like open fx have been extremely

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,879
valuable for writing

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,840
c-based plug-in plugins for compositing

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,840
systems

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,360
um but also things like the more modern

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
usd hydro and we're really looking

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
forward to seeing how hydro

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
can democratize things help customers

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,479
bring their real-time rendering

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,759
technology into our viewports

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,479
uh next slide mod um

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,319
so internally in our tooling we also use

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,080
a lot of open source software there is

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,800
proprietary technology we are across

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,919
platform

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
so there's more going on here but

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,599
there's a lot of open source so high

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,719
quality things like gcc

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,680
clang lldb gdp loads of analyzers and

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,240
linters uh most of our bulk stack conan

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,519
cmx

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,200
cons is all open source software

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,039
on the continuous integration front and

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
agile stuff build infrastructure source

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,160
code managing

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
again lots of open source use linux is

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,880
almost everywhere

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,600
get jenkins python engine x and apache

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
for servers

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
prometheus and grafana for monitoring

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,360
and reporting things all of that

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,640
is heavy use matt next slide

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,480
over to you i don't know anything about

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
cloud

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
yeah and i'll talk a little bit uh

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,440
briefly about

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,959
uh an aspect of foundry that probably

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,399
isn't the first thing that comes to most

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,040
people's mind

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,080
but we uh we have uh over the last

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,839
several years

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
built up an extensive experience of

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,399
building cloud infrastructure

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,160
uh we had a product uh called ethera

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,880
that we discontinued last year

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,800
brethren was really the tail end of a

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,399
multi-year

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,040
multi-year research and development

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,920
effort of cloudifying visual effects

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
workflows

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,800
that started with collaboration with uh

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
with certain studios and evolved into an

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,480
internal r d project and

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
kind of resulted in a commercial offered

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,680
for a period of time

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,959
what's really cool about this uh

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,560
knowledge we've built up with cloud

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,040
infrastructure is that we

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,399
are positioned to put out new projects

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,880
which we have in the works

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,560
but also it gave us a lot of contact

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
point with a lot of open source software

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
systems

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
uh in the cloud space so some of the

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,160
some of those that were in play were

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,000
around kubernetes and containers you

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,760
know we really think that uh container

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
technology is something that's uh you

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,399
know a big uh you know a big trend that

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,720
has

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
uh a lot of headroom uh especially the

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,320
visual effects industry for

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,200
for people to leverage uh we worked with

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,839
golang

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,519
uh and you know working with uh angular

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,399
for front end go line for back-end

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,880
systems

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
and all of the interconnect and that you

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,399
need to

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
build deploy and manage microservices so

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,760
calico

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
istio uh all of the data plane stuff

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,440
from

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,040
cockroach elastic for you know log and

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,720
log searching

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,959
and also open source systems to connect

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,600
artists to remote virtual workstations

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,000
so we work with turbo vnc and no vnc

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
um one of the interesting aspects with

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,160
this cloud technology is um

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,760
you know late last year if you're you

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,680
know following some of the

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,880
uh going ons in the classes there's a

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,399
bit of a you know

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,920
like they're calling it the license wars

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,000
in terms of some

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
open source systems making their open

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
source licenses more restrictive in the

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,079
face of

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
large cloud players coming in and

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,120
offering them as managed services

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
so that's kind of an interesting trend

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,519
that uh you know we're

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,560
you know we've sort of got an eye on but

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,880
i will say that

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,720
those systems being as open as possible

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,279
was a huge accelerant to us

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,839
and really helped us to build and deploy

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,120
our

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,040
cloud systems quite quite rapidly

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,959
um so robert uh why don't you tell us a

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
little bit about uh

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,320
some of the the challenges and benefits

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,120
that we've had

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
oh okay i wasn't realizing yeah this

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
would be in the deck

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,279
anyway so yeah i mean there's no such

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
thing as a free lunch

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,800
um open source software is free but uh

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,680
there are

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,800
niggles licensing mismatches when you

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,000
sort of want to use something but you

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,440
can't because the license doesn't match

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,600
something else in your stack

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,000
um that's something to be aware of the

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,040
aswf shift towards using apache 2 and

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,680
apache 2 like

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,720
clas has been very helpful in terms of

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,399
clearing legals

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
and will continue to be helped from that

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,519
regard i think um

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,279
there's sometimes less developer support

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,760
available in some of these libraries if

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,639
it's broke you've got to fix it yourself

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
abandonware

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,399
is an issue with some libraries so we're

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,959
very fortunate to have the aswf there to

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,680
curate

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,800
and be a guardian for vfx libraries

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,120
variable quality

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
not all software is created equal but

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,560
thankfully there's plenty of like

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,079
best-in-class open source software

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,240
and that's the ones we focus on so

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,600
you know it's probably true that

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,279
commercial software shares similar

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,279
challenges right not all great

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,959
and can be abandoned things like that

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,959
occur but all in all

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,360
open source software is very compelling

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,279
proposition for foundry

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,440
yeah and if you guys are following along

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,200
the deck that we made available this was

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
a slide we removed so you guys get a

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,639
free bonus slack today

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,639
right um okay so our contributions to

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,399
open source i mean primarily we consume

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,440
and we integrate and we ship open

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,120
formats things like that

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,920
but we've also contributed to some open

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,880
source bits so way back in 2004

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,480
we created openfx um we did some

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,680
performance patches for alembic

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,200
in 179 in usd

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,040
i think even as back early probably 0.7

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,040
we started looking at windows 14 so that

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,120
we could use it as katana viewport

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,480
and then finally shipped with the 0.8

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,680
version and contributed some of those

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,320
patches back to pixel

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,160
integration uh used the plugins

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,320
originally authored by pixar for katana

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,440
and mari we adopted and upgraded those

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,600
and i'll take a stewardship for them our

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,680
research team recently

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,839
made a machine learning server live it's

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,120
also open source and

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,200
we're really looking forward to seeing

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,600
what artists and customers can create

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
using

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,839
machine learning technology inside of

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,839
nuke um we're currently busy working on

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,560
a shotgun plugin in conjunction with

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,079
autodesk

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,240
it's not quite out yet could hopefully

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,839
shipping soon and then i guess par for

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,959
the course is the odd patch to things

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,079
like cute mesa

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:57,040
zinc open xr usd next slide

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,199
right so um i just wanted to touch on a

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,040
subset of the things that we'll be

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,720
working with in terms of open source in

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,720
the coming months

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
this isn't everything just a few

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,120
interesting ones to highlight

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,199
um so as mentioned definitely looking

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,440
forward to more usd integration

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,880
deeper integration building on top of

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,639
what we already have

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,279
also looking at doing hydro and most of

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,920
our viewports there's a risk i'm used to

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,079
used to rapidly evolving and improving

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,240
um but they they are you know the

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,760
library facilitates us using one version

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,279
customers using another inside of our

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,079
application so we'll leverage

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,399
techniques like that we're also going to

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,320
look

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,920
more at material interchange formats and

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
some of our applications

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,760
customers have been able for years to

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,279
use our apis to take materials safe from

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,279
mari into katana into their renderers

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
so it is a solved problem but having

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,199
those common interchange formats

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,440
uh is valuable is important so we will

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,199
be looking at material x and usd shade

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
for that for example

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,240
um open color io is coming out with

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,720
version two

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,800
uh some point soon um obviously that

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,399
goes in conjunction with aces upgrades

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,760
so um very i know a lot of customers

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,399
looking forward to that so

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,839
we will be integrating as well um and

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,680
then i just want to touch on our

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
internal sort of development efficiency

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,880
aspects

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,120
we have been using conan for c plus

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,000
package management i know the tools like

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,839
raz and bc packaged are used by others

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,639
raised in the linux predominant

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,399
vfx industry um uk 12 is predominantly

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,040
all conan based for third-party

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
libraries um katana was probably 90

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,800
uh third-party libraries was clean and

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
managed um it only

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,000
works currently inside of our ecosystem

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,639
and some tech debt that we need to

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,480
to remove before we be able to share

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,600
that more widely but we're hoping to

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
you know if things go well have

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,959
something towards the end of the year

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,399
and then we're also working with mesa

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,440
zing technology crafted by the

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,240
collaborate team

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,639
that'll help us to legacy opengl support

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
um

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,800
while we move forwards with vulkan and

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,639
metal on platforms like

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,279
osx thanks a lot

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,680
great um and you know there hasn't been

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,399
very

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,279
much visuals in this talk uh because we

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,399
are talking about

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,079
libraries and uh interoperability um but

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,480
this uh this is an image of

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,360
nuke studio with the um the color

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,560
management

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,120
uh system in the lower left um

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,079
that uh shows the open colorio

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,440
integration

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,600
um i was actually uh told by

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720
uh one of the new product managers that

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,959
uh thanks to

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,000
the way uh the really great way the open

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,800
color i o

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
uh spec is evolving the getting you know

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,880
version two stuff

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,160
in uh is is an increment is uh

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,920
you know much easier so we're

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,480
anticipating uh

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,839
that being a really easy transition so

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,680
uh we're actually quite pleased with the

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,800
way the the library is kind of organized

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,959
and evolving and

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,360
we're hoping that actually uh reflects

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,040
into our release timeline for

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,800
open color io2 and this is a

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,560
katana which is just a really great

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,760
lighting tool

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,679
your great uh usd support uh and we're

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,640
looking uh much more at uh

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,360
increasing our investment uh in usd

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,640
across

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,400
our entire product line uh nukemari

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,280
uh and uh and katana as well um

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
but uh yeah the usd support in katana is

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,600
really

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,079
uh you know kind of top-notch right now

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,440
so we're kind of forms the basis of

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,840
our existing uh our existing footprint

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,280
with

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,400
usd um so some takeaways so

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,120
uh i hope uh this gives everyone a

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,000
deeper

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,960
and more interesting perspective on how

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,280
a player like

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,480
foundry actually makes use of open

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,080
source in a

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,120
tangible uh tangible way we ship

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,320
we use we contribute to several open

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,440
source projects

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,840
uh we package open source into our tools

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,120
uh to empower creatives sometimes we

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,960
expose those

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
you know through epis or directly to our

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,840
libraries but really the focus is on

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,919
using

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,360
uh open source to add value to our users

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,280
and but we also use it to make our own

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,679
internal processes stick so to add value

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,919
to

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,919
ourselves and that's really important as

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,679
well uh like robert said you know big

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,440
investments in build systems and

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,960
packages package management systems is

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,559
really critical to us

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,840
uh and we're also really focused on

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,840
putting code into the hands of the open

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,679
source community some new projects and

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,880
uh enhancements as well and i think this

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,080
is an area where

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,320
uh we'll be increasing uh over time

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,520
and we also have big bets on multiple

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,919
open source projects

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,559
i really feel one of the great things

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,440
about

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,400
uh the academy software foundation uh

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,559
you know nurturing

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,080
uh so many projects is now you know

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,280
there's a really great outlay

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,880
of mature and uh you know

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,440
uh compatible like uh well adopted

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,480
open source projects out there uh thanks

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,880
to the

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,640
uh thanks to the efforts of the academy

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,720
and this really allows vendors like us

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,120
to uh build uh you know

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,880
more predictable longer term uh

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,280
strategies and release plans

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
around open source so i really think

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,080
this is uh

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,919
you know this is a big a big trend that

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,760
we're going to be banking on

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,600
quite a bit in the future is looking at

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,480
open source as the basis for more and

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,840
more things going forward

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,760
so um with that uh we

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,880
have uh we've allowed a bunch of time

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,799
for questions

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,160
uh i'll turn off the screen sharing in a

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,000
moment um

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,840
but uh if you note uh you can visit our

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,840
github uh our github link down in the uh

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,360
the lower right uh we have several

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,520
projects there including

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,280
the plugins robert mentioned with the

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,600
machine learning server and

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,760
several others so check it out if you uh

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,559
get a chance

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,760
that um yeah should we turn over to

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,919
questions rob

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,840
yeah so there's a couple in the q a bar

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,159
there uh the one on the top of the list

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,600
is from john frassois are you

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,799
considering open timeline

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,880
integration i

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,200
from recent conversations with the nuke

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,960
studio and flix teams i think the answer

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,440
is yes both are curious

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,480
with respect to open timeline into io

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
integration

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,320
um i don't think there are formal

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,720
roadmap plans for it yet but

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,080
definitely the sort of senior architect

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,600
engineers on both teams are

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,280
interested and are starting to look at

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,960
the technology

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,919
um second one

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,919
i hope that answers the question and

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,240
then one from d kincaid any plans to

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,600
contribute back the ocio nuke plug-ins

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,280
the ones in the oci repo

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,120
are very old yes i should have an answer

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,840
to this but i don't

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,600
i'll have to get back to to decon that

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,720
after a chat with christy

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,240
um i'm guessing yes but

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,240
don't know um

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,039
right then there's one from melissa

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,960
farcher

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,960
our furniture about vfx reference

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,799
platform can we expect python 3 to be

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,480
supported by foundry softwares in their

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,799
next versions

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
um

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
it depends some of the next up versions

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,080
won't

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,200
yet be python 3. i think katana 4 0 will

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,440
still be python 2 7 based

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,280
but work on python 3 is progressing on

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,880
all of those applications so

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,760
um there's alpha stuff on mari

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,799
internally uh nukes shipped alphas

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,760
already

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,760
um and uh i think katana is also

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,240
progressing

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,559
um right um

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,440
oh rory woodford said yes for the maori

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,360
on python

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:53,760
in the next version yesterday yeah

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:58,320
next question does usd have any concept

00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,640
of common 2d assets used in nuke

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,799
and is there any plans to more fully

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,159
integrate nuke with usg for elements in

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,480
a scene

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,480
um

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,360
he don't know i know there's more work

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,440
going on in the on the

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,559
yes from peter crossley great bro

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,559
supported by our team

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:24,960
well done uh

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:28,080
right um next one is from

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,320
on simo uh the usd side as well and

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,240
there's also the uh you know

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,799
interoperable usd with the

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,679
with 3d and nuke as well where we're uh

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,559
we're looking quite

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,840
uh quite a bit at uh how to expand that

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
in the future

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,799
next question from simo or simo

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,799
is exporting particles as usd point

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,840
clouds from nuke already supported or on

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:58,400
the road map

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,400
pete any chance you could feel that one

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,840
give you a chance to answer there yeah

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,039
okay

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,799
next one from dimitro korolov i hear the

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,600
foundry plan to include more machine

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,080
learning tools

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,840
inside of future new commercial version

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,520
we'll find we continue to support the ml

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,000
server after that

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,120
um this is a question for dan ring i

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,320
don't think we're

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,600
looking to to stop using the the ml

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
server

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,000
but there is certainly work on on

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,840
internal machine learning stuff as well

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,880
yeah we have uh several efforts uh using

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,400
machine learning

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,240
uh at a research level uh so there's

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,240
some some experiments going on there

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,360
from the um fairly wild to

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,600
maybe more more practical i will say you

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,799
know

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,400
machine learning and trying to find out

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,159
how to build tools for that that are

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,799
practical for artists is

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,679
uh you know remains uh remains a

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,320
challenge where we're

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,679
doing a lot of investment in research

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,720
the machine learning server that we

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,520
deployed

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,120
uh is definitely something that we put

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,080
out in order for people to build on top

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,640
of

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,360
basically the idea is you can you can

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,240
build a

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,960
ml model and use the machine learning

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,159
server

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,480
to allow a nuke node to uh to access

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,520
that

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,520
that model and uh and uh

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,400
yeah do do whatever interesting stuff

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,400
you can cook up with

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,559
one from marco are there any internal

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,480
tools you are using at foundry that

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,480
you're looking to open sourcing yourself

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:46,000
i guess the yes they are

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,039
most of them are sort of alpha pre-alpha

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,320
quality

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,679
um so i can't probably won't mention

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,559
much here

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,400
but i guess watch the space uh something

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,320
i did mention is i work on the conan

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,039
and ken's trips and support for building

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,760
lots of vfx based libraries

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,440
using conan that might be interesting or

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,240
might not depending on your on your own

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
internal tooling

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,360
cool um great questions um

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,640
fantastic and it's it's nice to hear all

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,320
the curiosity about

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,279
uh what we're doing around uh

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,080
some of these projects uh in the future

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,799
on

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,440
vfx reference platform and uh some of

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,880
those other

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,960
tools that were mentioned so that's

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,480
really good um

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,080
quite welcome so i don't see any more

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,840
questions coming in um so wow maybe we

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,360
can

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,600
wrap uh three minutes early it's pretty

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,400
tight

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,799
um great well thanks thank you everyone

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,840
for

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,799
the uh well-thought-out questions uh you

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,240
guys are

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,679
uh we really value your attention

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,559
and we hope you enjoyed the presentation

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,559
we hope it was

00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,559
