The Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) recently launched a Diversity & Inclusion Working Group to partner with open source projects and industry to affect change. Open Source is well poised to be an excellent entry point for people of all backgrounds into many industries, especially media and entertainment. In this talk, we will outline the overall mission and goals for the ASWF Diversity & Inclusion Working Group, emphasizing opportunities for involvement.  The session will conclude with a panel discussion on the current state of diversity and inclusion in Open Source and where we hope to see it in the future.

we're going to talk about today

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,200
about the impact that open source

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,799
software i think

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,240
can have on in the inclusion space

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,560
and how we can really tap into that and

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
make that a resource and but in general

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,840

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,640
working group that we have been forming

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,200
in the aswf

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
um and talk a little bit about what uh

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
what our

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,799
members and told us they are interested

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,439
in having the working group do

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
in addition we'll also go over our goals

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,920
and some of the deliverables that we're

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,799
planning to do

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
as a part of this working group that'll

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,840
be followed

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,280
with a panel discussion that will

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,159
include bridget powell

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,840
larry gritz and victoria long it'll be

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,759
moderated by carol

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,440
during the panel discussion please feel

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,560
free to enter any questions that you

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,080
have into the q

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,480
a box within zoom and

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
and that will come through to me and

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,040
i'll be monitoring that q

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,959
a so that at the end after you know the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,360
the questions that carol has prepared

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,360
are complete um we can go through some

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
of the questions that all of you have

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,360
um on diversity and inclusion so let's

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
go ahead and get started and talk about

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,519
the diversity inclusion working group

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,400
for the aswf

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,080
so the aswf formed this group as a

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
collaborative effort to advance

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,480
open source software development in the

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,360
motion picture and media industries

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
this is really a cross-industry effort

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,680
and includes

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,040
everyone who is interested in open

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,400
source software

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,480
um and improving the diversity and

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,959
inclusion across open source software

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,760
as well as within the vfx and animation

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,280
industries um it includes anyone who is

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,280
interested in joining the working group

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,519
it does not have to be someone who is

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720
necessarily a programmer though that is

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,200
obviously um

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,040
also a great thing but it can it can be

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
anyone who is interested in kind of

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,800
furthering this cause

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,440
for diversity and inclusion so far

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
we have done a number of things to move

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,200
this working group forward

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,040
we have a regular meeting set up every

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,319
month it's on the second

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,920
wednesday of the month at one o'clock

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,799
in pacific standard time in addition

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,480
we've now already held three meetings

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,280
with about 30 to 40

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,080
diverse people being included in each of

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,519
those meetings

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
they've actually been really fantastic

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,040
everyone has been very involved and had

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,400
a lot of really great things to add to

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,239
the discussion

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,519
um after our very first meeting we

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,400
surveyed our membership

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,720
to determine what people were interested

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,879
in

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,879
seeing out of this working group and

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,959
then based on that survey we drafted a

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,120
series of goals and deliverables

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,480
that we have now submitted to the tac

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,319
for approval for

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,920
the official working group now i want to

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,040
just go through a few of the survey

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,479
results so you have a better

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,799
understanding of where everyone was

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,600
coming from when this group got formed

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,479
we had about 30 respondents and the the

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,720
responses came from a wide variety of

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,639
uh locations so there were people that

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
were coming from all kinds of different

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
companies which i've included a small

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,440
selection on this

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,400
on the screen and as you can see this is

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
a wide

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,080
range of different companies that are

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,320
working within the open source

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,919
vfx and animation communities

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,240
one of the questions that we asked right

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,960
away was um how familiar folks are

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,720
with open source software um and again

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,520
you can see that this working group

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
very much is a spans a wide variety of

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,880
different people some people that are

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,120
extraordinarily familiar with uh

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,160
working with openstar software and other

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,880
folks who

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,160
are just getting into it and we really

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,520
want to encourage

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,520
that level of diversity as well

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,000
so what age group do you think is the

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,840
most important to target for increasing

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,039
diversity and inclusion in open source

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,280
communities

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,800
what we found with this question was

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,120
that overwhelmingly

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
people were definitely leaning towards

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
college

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,639
university and high school students

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,000
being the ones who were

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,639
the the key target if we could uh really

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
start to talk to college university and

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,759
high school students

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,080
about this topic that we should be able

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,360
to make some improvements in diversity

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,840
and inclusion within open source

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
software

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,320
another thing we were really interested

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
in was the types of programs that a

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,479
working group like this

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,039
should really be trying to target

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
and so we asked an open ended question

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,960
with some

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
suggested topics um the question was

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,800
what kind of programs do you think will

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,639
have the biggest impact on diversity

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,000
driving diversity and inclusion

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,479
um by by and far the number one answers

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,880
were

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,479
mentorship and partnerships so you'll

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,039
find when we start talking about our

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,680
goals

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,639
and deliverables these are some of the

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
the key points

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,680
that we have brought into a lot of

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,520
of the things that we're hoping to do as

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,520
a member as as the working group

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,919
so let me go ahead and hand this over to

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,000
carol who will be talking through the

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,400
goals and deliverables that we have

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
drafted up

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,440
yeah thanks rachel um so yeah so based

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,039
on the results of the survey

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,520
feedback from the group and uh both mine

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,440
and rachel's sort of and emily olin's

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,479
ideas in the area also

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,599
um we went together and formed three

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,720
different goals

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,520
for the group and then some deliverables

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
that we feel we can reasonably achieve

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,240
in a

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,960
you know year-ish we're not putting a

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,400
strict time frame on it yet but

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,080
goals and deliverables that we can

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,759
achieve within the working group so we

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,520
can measure our progress

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,039
um the first of those uh is

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,440
around student education and really um

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,960
what that means is these are broad goals

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,880
and then the deliverables are how we're

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,400
going to accomplish it so this school is

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
encouraging high school and college

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,160
students to pursue

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,680
a career in or participate in open

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,280
source projects

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
just by education um and tying it back

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,479
to

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,639
our film and visual effects and motion

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,720
picture industries and how

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,199
what an impact open source has on those

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,479
applications

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,599
the second one is around diversity in

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,039
the foundation itself working with the

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,120
different groups

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,479
in the foundation as well as the

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,479
leadership

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,919
of aswf to talk about what diversity and

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,680
inclusion means for

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,360
the foundation and its projects

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
um and then the third one is around

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
resources and guidance

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
for the foundation members whether that

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,360
be on an individual basis or you know a

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,599
company member basis

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
providing those resources and ground

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,840
truths for

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,919
our members to educate our colleagues

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,800
and the industry at large

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,879
on diversity and inclusion topics

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,400
specifically related to open source

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,759
but the premises are relatively general

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,759
so really being a resource for

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,039
our members and our community in that

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,680
area

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,240
so based on those three goals we came up

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,839
with some associated deliverables

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,279
that we think really tie it back are

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,320
things that we're

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,959
already splitting into subgroups in our

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
meetings

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,360
to start driving around these different

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
deliverables and what they're going to

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,959
look like

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,880
on the student education front the first

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,440
one is a mentorship program

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,000
as rachel noted targeting high school

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
and or

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,760
college students i'm looking at how to

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,800
tie those back into

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,839
partnering with aswf projects and using

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,760
linux

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,080
resources at the linux foundation

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,240
already has available

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
and then also promote partnering with

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,399
external organizations

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,200
to promote coding and software

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,880
development

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,560
and we think that open source is a

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,560
really awesome

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,480
opportunity to really get in get your

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,080
foot in the door and get familiar with

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,160
uh up to date and and you know and

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
recognize software development practices

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,560
across the industry

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,320
and so we're looking for examples of one

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,720
to two universities and

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,240
or and or organizations with which to

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,680
work so

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,120
if you have suggestions if you're

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,200
listening this call and you you think

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
you know a great fit of an organization

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,000
or university

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,040
um no limits on on location

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
over you know a global industry a global

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,560
organization

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
and so we're really looking to everyone

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,080
to

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,440
help us help us spread our reach in this

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,560
area

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,279
and the second deliverables

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,959
are around the diversity in aswf and i

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,880
sort of kind of alluded to this

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,800
when i was describing the goal but you

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,839
know working with attack and the board

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,079
to establish some real uh concrete goals

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,880
for the aswf leadership

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,160
and membership and then something that

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
we're already starting to work on and

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
get volunteers for

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,079
is a an inclusion ambassador

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,040
and per aswf project so

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,680
that we're linking back each aswff

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,360
product

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,320
project to the diversity inclusion

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,360
working group

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,519
so we have open communication and lines

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,519
and that ambassador can work to ensure

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,640
openness and inclusion in each of our

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
projects and and

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,959
keep that feedback and communication

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,920
going

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,720
and thirdly um around the guidance for

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,200
members

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,279
uh we're also looking at we came up with

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,600
in our last meeting

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
some great ideas to start a series of

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,839
blog posts

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,200
on inclusion topics starting with

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,040
things written by the members of our

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
working group but we're certainly always

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,160
looking for

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,959
new topics and new information and all

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,440
these things

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,200
that are so pertinent to all of our

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,079
areas of work

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,640
and secondarily a landing page for those

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,279
resources and educational material

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,240
that we're starting to gather all of

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,320
these are

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,839
in their very uh

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,760
initial and infant stage and and so any

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,399
feedback that

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,640
that you have or anybody has around

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,560
these goals and these deliverables

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,839
um we're really interested in hearing

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,040
everybody's feedback

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,079
um in this area and the next slide i

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,519
think is

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,760
along those lines where to give that

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,399
feedback um if you have it obviously you

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,000
can use

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,600
the chat right now or the q a um but

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,040
in a more permanent way if you'd like to

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
get involved we've got

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,480
our mailing lists that you can jump on

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,320
and then

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,760
our diversity channel in the aswf slack

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,000
that we're all uh pretty attentive at

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
trying to answer questions and and stay

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
on track and then obviously come to our

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,760
meetings

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,040
um like rachel mentioned um those are

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,680
the highlights that i wanted to give

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,600
rachel anything i missed

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,440
no um i mean i just want to you know

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,480
emphasize that we really are interested

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,760
in having an

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,040
excellent um diverse group uh worldwide

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
that can participate in these

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,920
conversations and help us

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,639
drive uh towards these overall goals so

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,560
certainly join the mailing list join us

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,040
on slack join us for the meetings

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,040
um the more the merrier i think that we

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,000
can we can make a big difference

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,000
if we all work together

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,079
i agree so i think that ends

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,200
our uh we we slammed through that nice

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,480
rachel that's great

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,360
um i think that ends our uh slide

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
presentation

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,160
portion of this event um and then we

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,040
were when we were talking about

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,440
um you know having a session at open

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,160
source days as a very new group

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,720
within the aswf both rachel and i felt

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,680
that it was

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,040
is really important to have it have an

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,880
honest discussion

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,320
about where we think we stand and where

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,279
we want to go

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,920
and so we thought doing a panel um with

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,920
a couple

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,680
esteemed colleagues that i'm going to

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,240
introduce would be

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,360
an awesome way just to you know start to

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
talk about

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
the work we're doing all three of these

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,399
panelists are

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,760
members of the diversity inclusion

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,560

um and is an active member of the dnag

an active and

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,160
uh committed member of the aswf

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,680
diversity inclusion effort so i want to

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,880
welcome all of

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,680
you to the panel

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,040
and kick it off with a fun question for

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,160
all three of you

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,920
and that i like to ask because

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,240
of the range of answers we get in this

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,560
question but when i say

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,920
diversity and inclusion what does that

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,279
mean to you

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,519
individually um anybody would like to

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,519
start

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,720
can you bridget sure

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,279
so um what diversity and inclusion means

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,560
to me

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,240
diversity to me describes what makes

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,000
each of us unique

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,360
so we all came from different

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,440
backgrounds we grew up in different

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,800
areas i was military kids so i moved

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,399
around a lot and got to experience

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,040
different cultures

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,720
and um having those different

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,680
experiences and those different

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,399
backgrounds

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,959
molded our our beliefs and our worth

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
ethics

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,759
and things like that so

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,600
that's the diversity side of it and the

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,839
inclusion side

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,160
means that we want to try to be

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,440
representative of people who have those

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
different backgrounds and have those

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
different beliefs so that when we're

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,759
working together on projects and

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,720
initiative we each have a

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,600
unique point of view that can tackle how

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,520
to handle those

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,880
those projects and initiatives in in

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,480
different ways that we would have never

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
thought about if we

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,839
um if we're working with the same kinds

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,039
of people that grew up in this

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,079
in similar ways as us um then we might

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,120
be able to handle

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,480
projects in a new way yeah

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:28,559
awesome thanks victoria

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:32,000
um i guess put very simply diversity is

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:35,200
the who and uh inclusion is the how

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,400
and diversity is is different um

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,200
it's visible and non-visible across

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
so many different things you know race

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,120
age

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,960
political views gender gender identity

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,960
sexual orientation

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,200
it's it's such a broad broad area

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,400
and inclusion is really how we include

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,280
that difference

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,320
um i guess it's a behavior you know you

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,000
can have

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,120
a really diverse team or company

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,240
but if it's not inclusive um then then

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,440
it doesn't work

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,640
um so um yeah that's that's

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,480
my thoughts on dni that's awesome

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,799
last but not least larry yeah i think

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
you know a lot of a lot of my thinking

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,200
around this sort of

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,400
stems from just recognizing that

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,880
you know as an industry you know we

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,360
are it's a creative industry and it's

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,440
one that is consumed by

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,400
everyone of all backgrounds and all

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,760
around the world

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,880
and so it's it's just glaringly obvious

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,080
when you look

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,160
at you know who is who's at the front

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,520
end you know making these things versus

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,120
who is consuming them

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,559
um these things are are not the same

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,840
there's obviously

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,080
you know vastly underrepresented groups

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,360
and that that makes no sense like i've

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,600
never seen anything

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,039
in my life that makes me think that you

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,640
know the talent and

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,400
interest in these things should be

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,400
anything other than more or less

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,320
randomly sprinkled through the

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,440
population um and so to me that means

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,559
um we're missing um the some of the

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,960
talent that we need

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,760
to to do the best things and just from a

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
totally so

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,360
selfish you know point of view like i'm

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,840
a consumer of movies i want to see the

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,799
best

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,400
most creative you know films and i use

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,559
software and i want it to be

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,559
you know top and i work on these things

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,039
and i want my co-workers to be

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,679
you know the most interesting creative

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,039
you know

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:38,799
um talented people i can find and so

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,600
any time that any of those things don't

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,240
you know are sort of suspiciously

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,679
non-representative

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,880
uh of the whole population i i always

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,840
view that as

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,880
like some you know like some group of

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,280
extremely talented

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
people that i want to work with and

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,120
consume the

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,000
products of their work are somehow being

00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,919
excluded

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,520
in a way that just makes us all you know

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,280
a little bit poorer

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,400
for not having them be part of the

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,880
creative process

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,760
yeah absolutely agree um yeah and then

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,520
anytime

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,280
panelists please you know jump in with

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,039
thoughts and things like that but

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,480
going off of some of the things you just

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,280
said larry

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,679
we talk about a lot you know we we say

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,480
with

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,000
open source software that it's open to

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,280
all and it's really

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,280
you know anybody can participate anybody

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
can contribute but if we actually dive

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,080
down into

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,799
reality um we we come across the same

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,559
unseen systemic barriers to entry for

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,159
people of underrepresented backgrounds

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,600
as in any other

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,240
organization um i wanted to talk with

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,159
you

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,000
larry specifically but everybody else

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,880
about how we make space

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,280
for for these groups um we've talked you

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,600
know

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,240
a lot about this throughout but love to

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,240
hear your opinion

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,919
you want me to start with that one sure

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,039
yeah okay yeah sure

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,520
but yeah i mean the the reason that i

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,919
think

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,360
open source has a particularly big

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,600
contribution

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:15,039
to make is that a lot of the

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,159
like it should on paper it should be

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,960
ideally you know posed to not have these

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,720
limitations

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,600
and be extra inclusive um and much more

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,280
you know meritocratic um you know like

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,760
lots of the things that lead to

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,559
the sort of implicit biases that might

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,200
make

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,679
someone's resume not get seen or you

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,440
know

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,440
people come away from an interview with

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,520
a sort of fuzzy they're not quite like

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,600
me do i really want to hire them like

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,880
a lot of that gets swept away because

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
much of the open source

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,559
development process uh it's remote

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,520
you're not you know

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,120
seeing people um there's usually sort of

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,880
song you know objective

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,559
you know aspect of it like the code

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,840
works or it doesn't it makes the project

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,600
better or it doesn't

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,640
um so on paper it's all you know

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,880
um the theory is it should be like

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,760
the most even you know playing field

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,559
that we should see

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
in anything that we do but in in

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,159
practice

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,000
if you actually look at the people who

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,200
are the most active participants like

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,440
you look at the

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,799
the technical steering committees of our

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,679
own projects as much as we're all

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,159
committed to this

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,960
and they're they're very uniform looking

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,799
right so

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,000
you know we have to get our own you know

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,120
house in order there

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,400
too um and it's very tricky

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
um you know i i think that that part of

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,000
it

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,799
is is just sort of you know correlation

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
like

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,080
um sort of diversity aside if you look

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,000
at the people

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,280
who are like in the leadership circles

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,400
of these projects

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,480
they're also the same people who are

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,320
kind of high up in those organizations

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,120
they're also the same people that you

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,760
see

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,799
um you know on the on the digipro you

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,039
know program

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,880
committee there are also the you know

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,840
the same people that you see

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,360
um you know in the scitec awards process

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
um you're like we keep we keep running

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,520
into the same people

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,080
including people on these calls and so i

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
think there's

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,280
there's this heavy networking effect

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,360
where once you're kind of in

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,480
with this crowd um those are the same

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,520
people that you see at

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,640
all of these coming influential groups

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,360
and so i think if you can crack any

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,080
one of them to pull the people in who

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,159
are not

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,000
already part of that you know that in

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,120
crowd i think that

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,919
not only is a direct contribution but it

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,320
also

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,240
gets them feet in with all of these

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,120
other sort of important industry

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,640
activities

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,320
and professional development

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,360
opportunities um

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,400
and so i like the phrase you said about

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,039
making space um you know i think all of

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,520
these groups

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,679
if you asked everybody they would they

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,240
would all say that not only

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,960
would they allow but they crave you know

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,120
more

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,039
diversity and inclusion but putting that

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,080
into practice is a lot more difficult

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,039
and i think it

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,200
it takes people doing things like saying

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,640
yeah sure you know i'm an obvious

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,840
uh i'm an obvious uh choice to be on

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,000
this panel or whatever but

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,279
but actually i want to pull in you know

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,039
this this developer

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,799
you know over here who hasn't done that

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,960
but i know they're capable of doing it

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,159
um maybe they wouldn't even think to

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,720
volunteer themselves

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,840
but you you know you you have to you

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,679
know take yourself

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,440
out a little bit and push some other

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,840
people in who you know are ready for

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,640
that

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,360
step and and help to sort of push that

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,080
process

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,960
along and and be inclusive in a sort of

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,960
more active way

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,640
absolutely yeah i agree with that of

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,679
like you

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,360
it has to be um

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,360
actionable it has to be it has to be

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,120
purposeful it can't be

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,440
you know anything that i've learned of

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,240
you know inclusion and diversity efforts

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,039
over the years

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,159
is it cannot be passive it's not just

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,440
going to

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,919
happen um you know overnight or

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,799
or by accident of things like that you

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,200
know if we want to

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,000
specifically in leadership roles

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,919
increase the

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,840
that visibility and that diversity it

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,559
has to it has to be

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,279
you know you have to decide to do it and

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,039
actively

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,440
do it um victoria then i've made it out

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,919
to be

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,080
too right like it's it's the the the

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,480
step of going from having that sentiment

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,320
to

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,760
putting it into process is actually

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,240
really difficult because

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,600
you know it's a pipeline problem right i

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,919
mean oftentimes

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,919
the the willingness to sort of make that

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,480
room and pull people in

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,679
executing on that depends on having

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,440
those next people

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,159
you know that line of people who is

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,760
ready to to move in and take up

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
you know those those positions and those

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,000
opportunities and that's why

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,080
you know i think a lot of the craving

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,880
that was revealed from the surveys

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
is you almost have to get people early

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,760
in their careers

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,200
and before they started their careers to

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,600
sort of get on those

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,240
paths and think yeah i could i could do

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,720
that

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,760
um and and and so then when those

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,240
opportunities

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,520
you know come up that we can make room

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,279
there are people there to fill those

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,840
slots and quite often that's the tricky

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,840
part

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,159
i think when we talk about sort of

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,640
making space

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,679
i think it's definitely a group effort

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,039
you know um

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,080
you know i train hiring managers on

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:29,279
diversity inclusion and unconscious bias

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,159
um and you know the the need to be

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,799
really aware

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,080
of your biases because we all have them

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,320
you know it feels

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,880
probably very uncomfortable to admit it

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,559
but it's just it's a fact human beings

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,520
are wired that way um and it's very easy

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,120
for me to sort of

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,919
you know talk through hiring managers

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,520
and let them know that you know

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,520
we like to hire people who are like

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,480
ourselves again that's that's a fact it

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,159
feels really comfortable to do that

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
but also i think it's really important

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,919
just for anyone whether you know

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,919
whether you make decisions about who's

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,600
hiding into a team or you make decisions

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,679
about who's promoted

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,200
it's everything you know it's about you

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,279
know you're part of a team and you

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,960
choose who you want to collaborate with

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,480
right and again you're still probably

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,159
making those decisions well

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,919
i choose to collaborate with this

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,640
particular individual because

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,080
they're like me right they they're like

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,320
me they look like me

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,320
they um think the same as me and it

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,640
feels really comfortable

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,399
so what i'm saying is to try and get

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,399
yourself out of that comfort zone and

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,360
work with people that typically maybe

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,320
you wouldn't

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,919
always choose to collaborate with and

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,000
and i think everyone has to be aware of

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,720
their their biases whether you're

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
someone in a company making decisions or

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,840
whether

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,440
you are just part of the team if

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,159
everyone's aware of it

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,600
then you can start thinking about making

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,360
steps to kind of you know

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,080
counteract it i don't think there's a

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,320
cure for for unconscious bias

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,320
but i think people should be aware of it

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,159
and and

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,000
the moment you start thinking about it

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,679
in every situation

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
you know whether you're you know it

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,559
doesn't have to be in an interview you

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,880
could just be in a meeting

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,799
with team members you know how you

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,360
include other people you know that one

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,080
person that isn't speaking in a meeting

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,840
why don't you encourage them to say well

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,080
you know what's your thoughts and

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,600
make sure that everyone has a voice but

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,039
i think it's really important for us to

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,880
all encourage each other

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:30,240
in those situations that's great

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,000
yeah along those those lines of

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
we hit on a couple things but i'm

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,240
wondering bridget if you can if you can

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,760
single out anything or many things that

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,200
you think would have helped you earlier

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,520
in your career along these lines

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,480
yeah one of the biggest things that i

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,159
that i would have loved

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,440
in in college is to have more hands-on

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,679
experience with with practicing software

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,279
practices and in real life

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,200
things like doing feature development

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,159
and then testing your code and learning

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,480
how to deploy it

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,279
and push things and we do a lot of those

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,799
things in

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,120
in school as like isolated

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,720
isolated classes like we were working on

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,480
a class project you typically just

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,399
put it in the zip file and upload it to

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,919
the to the class website

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,840
or you learn about testing or you learn

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,480
about um

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,360
back-end like database systems but we

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,600
never really

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,600
put it all together and i think one of

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,240
the the things that i would love to see

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,159
from um from the academy software

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,600
foundation and the open source community

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,640
is reaching out to

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,640
um universities and and building some

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,960
kind of independent study or a class

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,720
that

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,039
encourages people to learn about these

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,960
workflows um

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,399
and even like working with other people

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,320
remotely um

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,760
that's kind of taking everybody by storm

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,279
right now because of covid

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,240
um but like larry said working in an

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,679
open source

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,760
um project allows you to

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,960
to learn how to do that like learning

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,799
how to work with people

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,320
that are remote from you and how do you

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,039
how do you talk to people how do you

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,279
reach out to

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,159
how do you schedule meetings and ask for

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,640
help

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,000
um so i think that would that would be a

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,399
really great thing that i would like to

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
see

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,919
um come out of this which is one of one

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,080
of our deliverables that

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,320
that you presented yeah that's great i

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,480
i agree on the you know the remote

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,760
aspect of it is fascinating because

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,760
theoretically

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,279
you know open source should like larry

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,960
was talking about remove a lot of those

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,880
barriers if you don't have to be in a

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,600
specific physical location and you don't

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,520
have to

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,440
you know have a subset of experience and

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,919
resume to get involved and it's how do

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,799
we

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,159
how do we tap into that um and and make

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,080
it accessible and make it

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,559
a part of that and i see you know those

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,760
those mentorship opportunities is a huge

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,799
way to do that and so

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,600
you know if it and it you know you start

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,000
small and you

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,880
you build it from there until we have

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,640
something that

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
you know we can we can pile it out to a

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,919
bunch of different universities and

00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:02,320
um make a big impact but

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,000
a lot of those yeah and there's

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,679
yeah and we don't have to move on from

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,880
this specifically if you guys have more

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,360
thoughts but

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,279
um i was also thinking in terms of we

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,399
were talking about

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,159
um the impact of you know key

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,679
development moments and

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,600
good mentors um for ourselves and

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,720
and sort of spotting those behaviors and

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,480
encouraging them

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,240
um and i'm wondering if anybody wants to

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,519
jump in and talk about that or have us

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,120
an example of

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,840
some great mentorship and how that

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,840
affected you

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,760
no

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:45,279
[Laughter]

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,000
well um i know one of the things for me

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,360
i've been involved with um mentoring

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,559
others

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,399
for the past couple years ilm has

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,519
like allowed me to do that which i think

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,279
is is also a really great

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,440
point that other companies should also

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,080
try to do is making space for people to

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,200
to do these things like um one of the

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,600
the efforts

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,480
that i was able to to do a lot is to

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,640
talk to

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,120
students um just exposing them to

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,080
to the film industry and i think um if

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,399
more

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,000
students had exposure to just knowing

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,840
what's out there then it would

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,679
open a lot more doors for them to even

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,919
say or think that um

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,840
it's possible to to get into roles that

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,840
are that are related in film

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,120
i think when it comes to um mentorship i

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,880
think

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,559
you know what i think is really

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,399
important is to encourage

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,919
our diverse developers and

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:49,120
leads and you know encourage them

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,919
to be a bit more visible you know so

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,480
and so people have you know especially

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,720
you know

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,240
grads and and sort of junior developers

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,440
so they have

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,240
um you know more sort of diverse role

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,039
models

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,679
um and hopefully eventually mentors um

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,440
but

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,279
but you know that's not really simple

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,039
you know it's it's about kind of just

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,279
encouraging those members to maybe kind

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,600
of you know be in the spotlight

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,000
a little bit more i think that's really

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
important

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,399
yeah i agree i i'm kind of curious to

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,559
hear

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,320
from other panelists since we're on a

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,360
topic of sort of

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,679
mentorship like um you know what would

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,720
you

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,519
advise you know either from the for

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,480
people looking to be mentored or people

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,559
who want

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,159
to be helpful mentors or companies who

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,720
want to set up that like what have you

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,919
seen in your places of work or other

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,039
experience that you have

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,720
that make for for good or bad

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,720
habits in those directions and what

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,960
advice would you give people

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,399
um you know who sort of they want to

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,440
contribute in that way but they're not

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,440
quite sure how to start

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,360
for me regular meetings for sure

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
are like the baseline it's easy i know

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,760
when i first

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,679
like wanted to be a mentor in college

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,440
and um wanted to help

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,159
other like students that were younger

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,520
than me um

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,359
what when you first do it you're like

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,639
okay we'll set up a meeting every

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,480
month or so and then sometimes like the

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,240
person the mentee would forget about the

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,919
meeting or they wouldn't

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,520
like they wouldn't show up for whatever

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,760
reason um

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,040
so i think getting on a cadence and

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,440
making sure that that

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,560
baseline regular meetings are happening

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,280
is the first

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,560
um is the first step and it's really

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,200
important to make sure that

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,760
that doesn't fall off but then once you

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,000
have

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,599
established those meetings then learning

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,040
what that student wants to

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,720
wants to get out of their career what

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,919
they want to learn

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,000
would help guide you and and steer you

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,520
steer help steer them into whatever

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,440
career path that they want if they're

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,960
interested in film then

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,119
you could talk about more of your career

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,480
pathways um

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,160
if they're not then maybe something

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,440
that's tangentially related to how you

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,680
got to where you were

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,760
i feel like is also really helpful and

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
um just watching other panels for me

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,160
personally i

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,760
love when people talk about their

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,200
personal um

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,359
journey and i like when they give

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,040
concrete examples even if it means that

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,400
i don't want to be in that exact

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,680
position that they're

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,400
at but at least learning how they got to

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,920
what what how they got to that position

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,839
like what classes did you take

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,839
like what role were you in when you

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,839
first graduated and like learning that

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,119
specific journey is still super helpful

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,960
because it kind of

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,280
helps you understand how that person

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:44,720
thought about those career decisions

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,480
um so yeah

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,839
yeah i agree i agree with that a lot and

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,160
i'll be the first to say that

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,359
i i don't think i would be in the career

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,800
that i'm in

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,839
without good examples of mentorship

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,480
um and uh you know a lot of the the

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,800
behaviors

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,880
that i see and then i try and emulate is

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,160
you know that mentorship is

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,440
uh whether formal or informal you know

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,160
both types work um a two-way street

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
um and it it has to be you know the the

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,320
mentee

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,320
seeking being active and seeking

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,880
information but also the mentor

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,720
being open and available and offering to

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,200
give that information so

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,800
a lot of the time uh for for me what

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,320
that looks like is if you know you get a

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,079
question and a space

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,599
from someone that you know might be a

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,320
potential mentee just

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,560
opening that door and asking are you

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,560
interested in learning more

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,560
with this you know would you like more

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,079
information on this topic or if you have

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,200
any other questions

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,359
i'm here and i'm available and you know

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,240
setting that open door and making that a

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,359
priority

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,160
um often for me i found is

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,680
is all it takes a lot of the time to

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,839
make that space that we've been talking

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,839
about

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:05,040
um yeah along those

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,960
you know along those same lines um

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,359
you know we're looking victoria around

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,280
like open source is an entry point to

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,440
the industry do you feel like

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,359
that's something that you know companies

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,400
like dnag and other companies could take

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,640
advantage of from

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,400
from a from a recruitment perspective

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,520
too as a true entry point to the

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,000
industry

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,960
yeah to help with that yeah hugely

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,160
because

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,240
i mean open source is is

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,880
sort of the perfect network networking

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,440
um opportunities so

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,520
it's quite interesting you know we um

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,640
we're very active in going to university

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,200
job fairs

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,720
and you know what we tend to do is you

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,079
know it isn't necessarily just talking

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,000
about the negative what we're doing is

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,000
we're introducing the industry and we're

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,400
introducing the industry to

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,480
comp sci students and saying look have

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,119
you ever considered using your coding

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,240
skills

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,760
on movies um and for the most part

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,680
many of them haven't and you know i

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,000
think we stick out

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,839
like a sore thumb amongst you know in a

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,280
job fair you know people kind of come to

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,240
us with this big screen with all these

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,240
movies and

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,280
and they they head to us because i think

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,920
we're just we're

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,359
always the odd one out um and it's

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,240
always really appealing to them i think

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,960
one of the

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,359
common questions that students ask is

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,839
well

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,960
this all sounds really incredible you

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,800
know how can i learn

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,480
more and what can i do to kind of expose

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,119
myself to the industry and start

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,880
learning

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,880
things you know there isn't necessarily

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,599
a module that i'm doing

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,440
um you know in my course that is about

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,119
you know computer graphics but

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,680
you know what can i do on the side while

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,560
i'm studying and our advice is usually

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,119
you know

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,640
download some 3d software you know

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,880
there's kind of some really good

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,920
free um you know student stuff that you

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,960
can download

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,960
you know sort of you know doubling that

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,640
create kind of cool tools and just

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,480
experiment right

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,839
but actually what we should be doing is

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,520
saying and

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,680
there are these amazing open source

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,960
projects that you can be part of and by

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,599
doing that

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,440
you're networking with new people and

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,720
the very best way

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,400
is to you know expose your work

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,400
to the people who are in the industry

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,680
there is no better way

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,839
for you to get known by getting involved

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,520
in projects it's it's the very best

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,119
otherwise you know you can just apply

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,640
for a job when you graduate you can

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,240
apply for an internship

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,920
but if you've been working with one of

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,280
the developers at d neg then they're

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,839
going to be saying to me

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,359
by the way there's this you know great

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,320
student i've been working with on this

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,240
project

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,680
you know keep keep an eye out for them

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,680
on the next co-op or

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,960
on the next junior software engineering

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,160
role that we have so

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,480
to me it's it's it's the perfect way um

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,680
for for that step you know into the

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
industry we first

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,040
step into into a job

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,119
and for the employers it's it's also

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,240
such a

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,920
a risk mitigation strategy to recruit

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,560
from these places like you know how

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,520
how many times you know have you been in

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,720
an interview and

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,200
you're looking at someone and you've got

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,720
like an hour to try to kind of guess

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,240
like what would they be like as a

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
developer and your staff do they really

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800
know what

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,319
they're doing what do they like to work

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,440
with you know what's their communication

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,040
style

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,119
are they having a good day today or a

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,480
bad day today in the one narrow slice of

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,240
time i have with them

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,400
but if they were someone who'd been

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,720
participating on a project that

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,560
matters you know to your company like

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,880
you've probably had a chance to observe

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,920
them over a long period of time and know

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,200
for reals like what are they capable of

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,880
you know what are they what do they know

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,079
what does their code look like you know

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,680
what's their communication

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,440
style like you know with the senior

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,440
developers and the angry users

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,560
um like all of that stuff that you guess

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,720
at you know in an

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,160
old-fashioned interview it's just all

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,240
out there and known

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,079
if you're recruiting from participants

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,319
in open source projects that you care

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,319
about

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,880
yeah working on those group project

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,400
settings i think is a really good

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,400
learning experience as well

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,440
because when um just going back to

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,040
talking about

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,560
working on class projects like you

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,000
either have

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,359
the experience of being on a really good

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,880
team and everybody's doing their work

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,400
and you actually learn something out of

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,839
it to like

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,280
people who like there's only one person

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,720
that ends up doing all the work and you

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,119
don't really know what's going on and

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,359
then

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,040
also being in a situation where you

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,240
don't have a team like i've been in this

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,880
situation where people like i don't want

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,960
to work with you

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,800
and they just it's like this low-key

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,040
competitive environment in in

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,119
in college already and so if you have

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,520
the opportunity to work with people who

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,560
do really they want to teach you and you

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,599
want to learn

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,040
it's this mutual beneficial experience

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,680
that you get out of that that only

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,319
benefits

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,800
both of you long term um both for the

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,640
person

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,160
mentoring you and and the company that

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,040
they work for and you

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,680
actually learning something that um

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,680
that's useful

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,200
yeah and i think it's you know we've

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,520
talked a lot about

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,200
we're the academy software academy

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,800
software foundation but

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,319
i also want to take a second to make

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,520
sure to point out that

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,400
you know i'm not a software developer

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,359
true and true

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,400
by trade i dabble and i write and sure i

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,880
can code

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,920
but most of my i want to make sure and

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,599
highlight too that

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,760
within the aswf because of its

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,240
connections to you know creativity

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,839
the film and vfx industry that there's

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,839
you know there's so many opportunities

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,839
to get involved because the reality is

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,599
these these open source projects are

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,480
used so heavily

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,240
by you know by every every major film

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,319
these days every small film these days

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,319
even if you whether you know it or not

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,640
and so there's opportunities to get

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,839
involved um and get familiar with the

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,560
softwares that are

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,000
being used and you know we need feed the

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,839
the teams need feedback

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,599
they need people to test they need

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,359
people to just uh you know

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,280
say whether their documentation makes

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,119
sense um and there's gaps

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,400
because there's a huge amount of things

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,160
that happen as

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,480
people that are developing these

00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,440
projects are so close to them

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,040
that it takes someone um new coming in

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,440
and looking at it and and

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,720
from a fresh perspective and saying

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,280
things that

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,640
aren't aren't immediately obvious to

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,319
people that are so close to these

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,920
projects and it's it's

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:18,480
it's a huge thing and an opportunity um

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,079
that we're frankly missing in a lot of

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,040
these projects right now

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,240
um and so whether you're you know

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,760
software developers

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,319
is a key component um but not the only

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,040
one and that's the cool

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,920
already you know diverse nature of our

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,280
industry

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,480
in a lot of ways that i think is just

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,079
amazing i was going to say i think you

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,480
know when when we

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,000
when we talk about you know our industry

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,000
and our on our companies and the

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,119
different roles that are available and

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,920
the different um career routes it's it's

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,920
so broad you know it's everything from

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,440
being really super creative to being

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,359
really really technical and then of

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,440
course everything in between

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,359
um and i think that that's what students

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,720
are really interested in hearing about

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,960
you know saying well actually you know i

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,640
may not be the best coder but i love

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,359
doing this or

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,640
you know i'd love to lead projects and

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,400
and be the one that's you know

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,000
scheduling everything and

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,440
and you know and that's really important

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,240
you know for us to find you know

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,040
the future project managers and leads so

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,920
it's

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,599
there are so many different

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:29,280
opportunities that we can talk about

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,599
yeah it's really great um

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,680
along those lines i want to give each of

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,119
you some time to you know just talk

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,160
about what you really think that the

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,000
aswf can

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,680
our working group can contribute and

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,319
open source software if there's anything

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,920
that we've

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,599
you know sort of missed that you're

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,720
truly passionate about

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:51,839
um what do you think we can do now

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,839
what do you think a long term looks like

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,240
i think working on the the goals that

00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,680
we've set

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,359
um is going to be what determines the

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,160
success of

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,359
the software foundation i think um we do

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,880
have those

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,640
i feel really passionate about reaching

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,400
out to universities and

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,440
the mentorship aspect of that and so um

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,640
proving that that is a worthwhile thing

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,839
to do

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,200
is going to be the first

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,200
hurdle i guess to get over

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,000
i would say just being visible just

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,160
being visible everywhere but not in

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,160
not just in the very obvious places you

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,920
know as larry said earlier you know

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,000
we're used to attending you know the

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,920
digi pros and the c graphs and

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,440
and you see the same you know group of

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,240
people there roughly every year

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,520
and that's great but we have to be

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,520
visible

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,280
um in in you know groups or events that

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,599
we're just not used to attending

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,280
um and really broaden our networks and i

00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,400
think that's the really the key

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:05,599
thing is is exposure um but

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,599
just with a much broader outreach

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,079
yeah i definitely agree with that as

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:14,880
being being in places where you wouldn't

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:17,599
normally think to be

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,200
that's cool yeah so thank you guys for

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,119
this discussion and we want to continue

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,000
it um but we want to start to take some

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,839
questions

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,520
uh from the q a um and so rachel's gonna

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,280
help us facilitate that she's been

00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,800
watching it but

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,200
jump in and answer on any of these

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,240
questions that we have from the audience

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,240
as well

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,160
yeah so we have a bunch of um great

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,760
questions in the q a we also have a

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,119
really good discussion going on in the

00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,200
chat window so

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,800
so i'll just try to come up with uh what

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,680
what might be the next next thing for us

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,240
to talk about

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,319
um to start with one of the questions uh

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,359
there was some conversation in a q a

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,680
about how

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,680
one one company was working on a series

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,240
of dni working sessions

00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,800
over the next couple of months and he

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,359
asked if

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,880
we could pick only a couple of ideas to

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,280
implement at a company

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,000
to promote dni what would be your

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,839
choices

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,839
for best starting points

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,359
i would say for me it would be what

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,680
victoria was saying is like

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,079
try to find a conference that you

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:27,839
wouldn't normally

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,319
attend for me personally i always point

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,400
to

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,680
when i went to the national society of

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,359
black engineers

00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,760
and dreamworks was there dreamworks

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,400
animation and that's how i got

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,160
to talk to an hr representative and a

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,520
couple of engineers that were that were

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,440
there representing

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,800
um dreamworks in the film industry other

00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,280
and otherwise i probably would have

00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,720
never

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,400
been able to to have any kind of access

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,800
to it at all so even having the

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,200
opportunity to talk to someone and

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,640
have them look at my resume was was

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,160
fantastic to me so

00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,760
things like that like find a different

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,800
conference that's not siggraph or

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,720
digipro that you wouldn't normally go to

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:10,000
um would be a starting point

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,000
awesome i would say sorry

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,760
um i was i was going to say that the big

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,480
one for me if you could only pick two

00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,800
things

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,040
talk about unconscious bias i bang on

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,480
about it but it's it's so important i

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,440
think it's really interesting and i

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,359
think that

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,440
um day-to-day people just don't think

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,559
about it and so if

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,160
you really create that awareness um

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,040
across your your teams and then yeah

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,359
then people can

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,480
start thinking about it more day-to-day

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,559
in meetings

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,240
even in code reviews it's there's

00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,359
there's just examples for absolutely

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,599
everything where

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,599
where you know unconscious biases is

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,319
active

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,280
i think you know if you look at across a

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,760
lot of our

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,319
organizations these companies um you

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,680
know if you

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,359
look at um you know the sort of hiring

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,319
of engineers you know the the junior

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,160
level hires that we make um

00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,240
no it's not perfect but it's not half

00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,200
bad either we do we do okay there a lot

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,400
of the time

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:13,119
um and then if you look at the leads

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,079
that's a much narrower and less diverse

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,680
looking group

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,280
and if you look at like the really

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,160
senior people

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,680
that's even narrower than that so you

00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,280
know i i think

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,520
if you were just gonna do one or two

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,720
things sort of bang

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,599
for the buck wise i think that maybe

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,160
um a really high value would be trying

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,079
to put

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,440
some of these you know sort of

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,760
mentorship or

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,960
buddy system kind of things in place

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,160
so that you can cultivate you know your

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:49,440
recruiting and your junior staff

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,760
into staying um get

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,680
making sure that they are you know

00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,119
shuffled onto the worthwhile

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,079
projects you know and and and rising up

00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,240
in the organization

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,240
and then also then turning into the

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,640
mentors for that next generation too

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,800
like

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,200
like i like a lot of the you know

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,839
university and even below recruiting

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,640
uh initiatives but those are longer term

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,480
um but we

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,839
we're all starting out with a lot of raw

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,800
material to work with

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:19,440
in our companies already um but i think

00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,079
making an extra effort to make sure that

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,119
they are cultivating their careers and

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,680
getting the choice

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,880
assignments um that will will help their

00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,920
professional development

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,240
is is really i mean i think in terms of

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,880
like

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,559
results for effort is probably very high

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,920
up there

00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,480
is my suspicion so you know a related

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,680
question

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,599
to what you were just talking about

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,480
larry not exactly the same but somewhat

00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,680
similar um there was a question in the q

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,240
a from cheryl

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,599
uh where mentioning that we had talked

00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,839
about how there's a focus on

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,640
college age students for the working

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,720
group

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,079
and um and that this seemed like the

00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,000
right group to focus on

00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,400
but she also wondered whether there

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,040
might be some focus on career changers

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,400
as well

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,280
ways to kind of promote um folks moving

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,319
from one

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,880
area of an industry into another uh to

00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,440
to get into into this type of open

00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,079
source

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,559
related and software development related

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,480
work

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,280
uh do you guys have any thoughts or

00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,280
ideas about that

00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:24,160
yeah i think i think

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,079
trying to think sort of from one

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,000
industry to another is

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,040
that's that's definitely one thing but i

00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,440
would say just promotions

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,800
all together um you know one thing that

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,079
i've been talking to

00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,960
to managers about at d-neg is again

00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,400
reassessing the process for promotions

00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,520
and i think that's really really

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,760
important i think

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:50,640
that there has to be um a very robust

00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,720
process in place for when you choose who

00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,480
you promote into leadership roles i

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,119
think people need to

00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,839
rethink sometimes what a lead or a good

00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,720
manager

00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,400
are you know it i think people always

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,319
assume that you know the one that has

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,319
the loudest voice

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,079
and always speaks up in meetings is of

00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,160
course going to make the best leader

00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,920
that's not true at all you know i think

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,720
it's about approaching people in the

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,040
team

00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,359
um whether they are interested in in

00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,200
being a leader or manager one day and

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:22,400
giving them the right training the right

00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:25,599
right exposure to that um and

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,200
um and just really opening up that

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:30,319
everyone has an opportunity

00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,480
to apply for that role um

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,520
and and be considered and be given the

00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,480
right

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,760
leadership training and to to enable

00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,760
them to achieve those goals

00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:50,640
any other thoughts on that one

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:53,119
i read i i'm sure any of the rest of you

00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,720
who have had um the unconscious bias

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,240
kind of training and other things

00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,920
you've probably heard the same thing i'm

00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,680
gonna mess these numbers up because i'm

00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,280
i'm just trying to recall it from memory

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,960
but um you know

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,880
there's a sort of um you know

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,280
stereotypical behavior

00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,800
out there where you know if you have a

00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,119
list of requirements for

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,839
to apply for a job or to get a promotion

00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,480
that you want

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,000
you know that so the stereotype goes uh

00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,160
and i think there's truth to this

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,119
you know the typical man will apply for

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,960
that promotion

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,800
if they think they have about half of

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,359
the qualifications that it calls for and

00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,119
say

00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,480
i'll get in and then i'll show them i

00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,040
can do the rest of the stuff i know i

00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,599
can do it

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,720
and like but if you ask you know a

00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,200
typical woman who

00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,319
is equally you know qualified like very

00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,119
frequently

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,599
she perhaps won't even apply for the

00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,160
position

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,960
until she has every one of the check

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,920
boxes

00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,200
like completely nails right and so i

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,319
think you have to sort of and this

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,559
happens at every

00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,920
level right it happens in the apply that

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,800
come into the company

00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,760
it happens in the okay i'm there like

00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,920
should i

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,359
you know be agitating to be on this

00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,480
project that i think is going to be

00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,240
really important

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,319
it happens at the like how do i become a

00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,440
lead level like at all of these

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:08,640
you know choices so i think you know

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,440
sort of changing the the culture so that

00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,400
it isn't

00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,800
always the you know the person who um

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,960
you know

00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,079
like you said is the loudest or maybe

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,599
would would

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,280
like you need to you need to pull in the

00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,520
people who are qualified

00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,040
but maybe they wouldn't take that leap

00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,640
and make sure that they're also

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,640
they're being considered they're getting

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,040
put in those positions um because like

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,280
that's

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,720
you know that's a big portion of the

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,559
talent that's that's there for the

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,160
taking

00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,680
that makes perfect sense it actually

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,440
reminds me of something i'd mentioned to

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,280
carol a little while ago where

00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,280
even internally talking about career

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,720
changes i've had a lot of people in my

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,319
13 years at ilm

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,760
asked me to teach them to program

00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,680
artists who asked me to teach them to

00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,839
program but they were all

00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,720
what you might consider the typical the

00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:55,040
not not diverse individual

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,400
um and where i think many of the the

00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,520
more

00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,760
folks who might fall in one of those

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,440
diversity categories would also be

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,000
interested in it but might not reach out

00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,000
to do it

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,280
um so i feel like that that is a really

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,280
great point

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,400
um let's there's one other great

00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,520
question in here that i want to

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,640
definitely get to

00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,400
uh which is that most people are

00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,440
already super stressed with their

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,480
workload deadlines low budget etc

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,040
do you think it had it is an issue

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,799
of free time for people of diverse

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,240
backgrounds to be able to get involved

00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,240
does anyone have any thoughts on that

00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:34,240
i could it's it's a you know

00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,839
it's a it's a thing i think a lot about

00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,160
and i think that there's two angles to

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,160
it

00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,680
um and it goes back to something i said

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,880
earlier um

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,440
is that this this work is purposeful

00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,599
on this work is is a choice but it also

00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,640
needs to come from the top down and so

00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,240
you know if you're if you're doing this

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,440
work in relation to your company

00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,079
specifically

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,599
um that it has to be a company-led

00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,920
initiative and your company should be

00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,240
making time for you to participate

00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,359
in these efforts and it should be tied

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,599
in this day and age

00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:05,280
to if you're a manager or in a

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,440
leadership role it should be tied to

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,520
to your job performance to a large

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,799
extent because we've all seen

00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,599
the relation to how companies and

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,880
organizations and people perform better

00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,240
when they're in

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,640
representative uh situations where

00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,920
where it's inclusive and diverse and you

00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,000
have other people that

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,240
that look like you and or or act like

00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,359
you are similar to you and you're not

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,160
the odd person out um and

00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,839
it pro it promotes better working

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,880
environments and more productive

00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,880
people in general and there's been many

00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,680
many studies that have shown that

00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,040
um so i think if i were in that

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,280
situation and feeling

00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,319
like i didn't have you know the the

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,799
bandwidth

00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:52,400
um or the time in my company

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,839
specifically it's a little different in

00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,200
open source software

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,880
where sometimes it's not company

00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,440
sponsored um

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,480
but in general with my company if i was

00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,079
feeling that way

00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,160
it would be a conversation that i would

00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,079
start with my manager

00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,359
um and then really start to you know

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,200
take that on and

00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,520
and have that conversation as a starting

00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,119
point of i feel this is important

00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,280
and i'd like to contribute in it but i

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,079
don't have time um i don't feel i have

00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,680
time

00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:21,280
can we can we make time i should also

00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,280
say that you know this is why we have

00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,319
committees i'm part of

00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,160
various dni committees and we all have

00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,760
something that's come up and you know

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,280
someone's you know

00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,359
doing crunch time at the end of a

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,280
project and they just cannot spare a

00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,880
single minute but that's fine

00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,720
because the people that do have some

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,200
time will take on you know

00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,799
doing a panel or doing an event and then

00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,640
they'll come in the next time when

00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,920
i'm really busy i'm like okay i need to

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,359
step out of this one

00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,440
and then it's kind of over to you and

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,359
that's how the committee works

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,040
so you know we you don't need to commit

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,799
24 7.

00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,040
you can kind of dip in and out and there

00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,680
might just be one project that you lead

00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,240
or you

00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,200
are really passionate about one area um

00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,599
and then you know

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,720
when when things are insane for you then

00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,880
that's fine you know you just

00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:10,880
concentrate on that so there's ways

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:13,680
there's ways to work around that

00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,359
so we are getting very close to time um

00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,880
so we probably should wrap this up i

00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,599
feel like i could talk about this for

00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,240
another

00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,000
hour though um there's been a lot of

00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,720
really great conversation in this in

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,520
this panel and i want to thank the

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,160
panelists

00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,079
um bridget larry and victoria uh thank

00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,480
you very much for joining us today

00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,079
this has been fantastic um we've also

00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,720
had some really great conversation in

00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,799
the chat

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,160
um there was actually a a wonderful

00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,480
suggestion of

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,599
providing on our our page with the

00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,280
working group

00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,280
where we're providing guidance to our

00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,640
members of trying to bring in some

00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,480
guidance around

00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,720
running meetings where people may have

00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,359
disagreements perhaps about code

00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,880
um and uh how do you make that a

00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,720
welcoming environment

00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,079
so that someone of a diverse background

00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,920
is not immediately turned off

00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,960
i think that's a great topic and wish we

00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,680
could have actually talked about that

00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,880
right now

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,720
um uh but i did want to just mention

00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,000
that that came up um we're really really

00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,880
interested in getting more people

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,079
involved so
