MaterialX is an open standard for the description and transfer of rich material, shading and lookdev content between different DCC tools and renderers. In this session, we discuss many of the additions and improvements to the MaterialX specification, library, shader generation module and viewer from the past year, as well as providing a brief preview of current and future developments.
