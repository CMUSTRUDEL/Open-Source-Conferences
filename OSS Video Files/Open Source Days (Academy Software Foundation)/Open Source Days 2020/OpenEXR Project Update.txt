The OpenEXR Open Source Day Session will review the latest developments and discuss the upcoming 3.0 release of OpenEXR. We will also introduce Imath as an independent project/library.

In recent developments, the 2.5.3 release of OpenEXR includes many small bug/security and build/install fixes and a read performance optimization. It includes all the recent improvements that are production-ready. We've also updated the technical documentation and the openexr.com website.

Looking forward, the 3.0 release will deliver a major reorganization and cleanup of the project, which should make building and installing OpenEXR simpler and more reliable. It will include a major rewrite of the core library that promises to significantly improve read/write performance by reducing buffer copies and improving thread-safety. It will also include a C-language version of the low-level IO.

The new Imath release features some significant improvements and modernizations to the code: modern C++, improved CUDA-compatibility, online documentation.

We would like to solicit feedback and suggestions on all these developments from the developer community.

We would also like to discuss with the motion picture community what role, if any, the reference implementation of OpenEXR should play in encouraging consistent use of attributes in the ACES Container spec (SMPTE ST 2065-4).
