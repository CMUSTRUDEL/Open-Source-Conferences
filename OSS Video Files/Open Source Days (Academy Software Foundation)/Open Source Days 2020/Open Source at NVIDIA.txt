NVIDIA is a part of the open source community. We use open source software is used in almost every software project at toe company. In addition, we create and maintain dozens of open source software libraries for areas like deep learning, HPC, autonomous machines, rendering, design & visualization, and others. In this talk we will discuss the processes NVIDIA has put in place to streamline the licensing and intellectual property issues around open source software adoption, and discuss some of the public contributions the company has made. Recently NVIDIA has embraced Pixarâ€™s USD and Hydra as open standards to describe and render complex 3D worlds. We will discuss how these libraries are being adapted within NVIDIA to enable real time performance on complex virtual worlds, ray tracing with Vulkan and DX12, drawing many viewports concurrently, and streaming computational results from libraries like our PhysX simulation engine.
