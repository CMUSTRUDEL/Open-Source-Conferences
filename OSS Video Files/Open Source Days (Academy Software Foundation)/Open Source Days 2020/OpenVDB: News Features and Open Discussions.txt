The purpose of this meeting is twofold; to summarize the state of the OpenVDB project and invite attendees to openly discuss issues and possible future directions. To this end we will first give a brief introduction to OpenVDB and it's governance, followed by an overview of new and upcoming features - including an exciting new announcement! For the second half we invite attendees to participate in an open discussion about anything related to our project, including suggestions for new features,  bugs and issues, and questions on how to get involved etc.
