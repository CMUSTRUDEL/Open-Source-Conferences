Intel will present the oneAPI Rendering Toolkit product updates of their suite of open source libraries for high performance ray tracing. Hear more about their Open Volume Kernel library which provides high performance volume traversal and sampling functionality for a variety of volume types for a variety of computations optimized for the latest processors featuring SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX512 instructions enabling extreme performance for volume rendering engineers. Also hear about Open Image Denoise, which provides an open, high-quality, efficient and easy-to-use denoising library for path traced images. In conclusion this talk will discuss the collaboration with ANARI relating to the Analytic Rendering Interface project under the Khronos Group governance. This is a cross industry, open project aimed at cleanly separating the scene descriptions that Digital Content Creators (DCC’s) provide and the various backend rendering implementations which then generate images.
