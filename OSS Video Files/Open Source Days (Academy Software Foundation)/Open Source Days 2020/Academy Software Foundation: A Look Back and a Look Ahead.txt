academy software foundation today

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,440
where we are going to look back and look

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,759

there we go so we have a subtitle the

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,719
academy software foundation

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
accelerating so we've done a lot in the

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,520
last few years and we'll talk about that

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,960
but first

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,840
we have a new video and we'd like to

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
share that with you what you're going to

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,439
see

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,439
are shots of various movies where

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,080
our projects our libraries were used

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,080
let's have a look

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,270
[Music]

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,960
every single part of the filmmaking

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,400
process is touched by software

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,479
and a lot of that software is open

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
source software the academy software

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,840
foundation

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,880
exists to provide a great home for open

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:41,840
source projects

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,840
that we as an industry use every day

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:55,209
[Music]

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
whether you are a user of open source

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,000
software or an engineer

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,360
or a company that relies on open source

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,239
software we want to create the right

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
ecosystem

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,330
for you to get the most out of the open

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,959
source software that you need to use

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:57,840
[Music]

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,120
amazing work done by many people in our

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,879
industry

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,280
at all level of visual effects and

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
animation using

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,360
the libraries in the projects that we're

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,239
going to talk about here and

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,400

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
days

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,239
so right now in this hour uh these are

and i'm going to do the short

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,920
introduction um

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,519
on the background for the foundation

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
itself

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,760
this is uh in reverse order um our

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,040
agenda as we're going to go

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,439
um emily will follow me with dan at

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,959
with the tech and rob at the end will

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,480
give us the look

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,400
forward so the foundation

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
if you were here last year at the first

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,480
open source day we had just been a year

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,599
old and now we're two years old

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,640
we put together a timeline here to

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,160
in one snapshot give you and anyone in

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
the audience who would be new to the

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,519
foundation

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
a bit of the background of where we came

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
from

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,960
um in a nutshell it all started in the

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,880
scitec council

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,120
and an investigation that lasted

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,960
nearly two years on the topic of open

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
source software in our industry and what

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,000
could be done about it

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
and at the end of it that investigation

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
concluded we should create a foundation

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
and the companies that are listed there

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,320
under the uh the august 10th

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,320
2018 banner are the founding members and

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,479
we're very grateful for these companies

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,160
to to go in take the risk

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
it was more than a theoretical

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
commitment there were also

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
some funding into that they had the

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
courage of their conviction

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,479
they came together and they created the

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,759
foundation um

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,639
the first project openvdb came shortly

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
thereafter

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,400
proposed by dreamworks with new members

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,600
that joined us

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,560
and then we had open color i o open exr

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
open q in quick succession with new

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,320
members coming in

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,199
and we had our first open source day a

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,600
year ago

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
with open timeline coming up as a new

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,520
project

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,320
and a new group of members joining in

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
september

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
we had apple and microsoft training and

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,479
about that time shortly thereafter

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,759
we reached a million dollar in funding

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,880
yearly funding for

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
our foundation which is an important

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,680
milestone because

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,919
in our industry there are many um

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,080
many organizations that are doing a lot

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,840
of good good work on a voluntary basis

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,400
but they don't always have the budget

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,160
here when we created the foundation um

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,199
having the capability

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,360
to the budget to to take to follow up on

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,039
what we wanted to do is very important

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
and we hit that milestone just before

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,840
corbin 19

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,800
hit us all uh in our in our lives both

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,919
personally and

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,280
and in our businesses and so we happened

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,039
to be

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,840
not prepared nobody was prepared for

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,120
covet 19 but we were we had a solid base

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,080
to enter into that

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,479
that moment in time and we continued our

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,520
work

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,840
as it turns out the open source model is

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,039
a remote collaboration model already

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,880
and so it was quite

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
natural for us to continue working

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
pretty much the way we had

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,479
uh there was a lot of disruptions in

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,560
people's lives and and

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,479
we we slowed down a little bit but we

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,600
were able to pick the pace quite

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,280
fast and then we had a number of new

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,639
members that joined us

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,479
um and culminating with today the

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,400
announcement that we did this morning

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,360
with unity technology conductor

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,639
technologies

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,240
and simpty joining us so in a nutshell

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,759
that's our history um and these

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,000
are the companies that are making the

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,440
foundation that are contributing

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,120
uh in um in engineering time

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,840
and also in funds to make the foundation

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,160
go forward so a moment to say thank you

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
to

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,759
all of these companies if you're working

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,560
at one of those companies

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,360
thanks to you and to your organization

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,280
if you're

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
not if your company is not listed here

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,240
and you wanted to

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,639
become part of the foundation don't

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
hesitate to contact any of us contact me

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,639
and i'll be right we'll be glad to show

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,599
you how you can join this is all also

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,039
listed on our

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,120
website so in a nutshell our mission

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,280
has not changed if you've been here with

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
us in the last presentations it's the

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,280
same

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,199
but for anyone you our goal is to

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,400
increase the quality and quantity open

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
source software

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,800
by adding a governance model a legal

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,599
framework and a community infrastructure

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,319
around open source in the motion picture

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,800
industry

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,599
and our goals here they are not going to

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
read them

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,240
but they are about providing a technical

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,919
infrastructure

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,599
for the development of open source

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,319
software and making sure that everyone

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,400
can

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,639
know how to participate that there's no

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,039
mystery in that it's very easy to come

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,000
and

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,039
join us the foundation is structured

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
this way

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,800
the technical advisory council led by

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
dan

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,879
is the beating heart of the foundation

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,599
this is where the engineers are this is

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,240
where the

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,000
important decisions are made and the

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,919
governing board

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,279
and the outreach committee are there to

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,080
help the tech

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,919
to um to do their work and to support

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,479
the decision that they make

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,440
um governing board will take care of

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,360
finance and

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,200
legal and outreach gravity will make

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,720
sure that the projects are well

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,279
um are well communicated and and a lot

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,920
more

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,720
do conferences like this open source

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,519
days

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,800
um and we will talk about that these are

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,360
our six projects

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,720
um they are listed here and and we'll

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
talk more about them in this

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,600
presentation

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,440
each one of them has a longer

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,680
presentation also as part of

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,519
open source days and they're all built

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:15,360
on our continuous integration platform

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,680
our activity is focused on our projects

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,760
but we have a mission to help all open

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,040
source projects in our industry

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,080
and john murtic in our group has

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,959
put together the aswf landscape which is

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,880
a snapshot

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,000
an interactive snapshot of all the open

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
source projects

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,760
in our industry it's on our website

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
encourage you to go

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,360
and see it and today um

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,480
and tomorrow as part of the open source

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
days

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,839
this is the program that you have seen

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,480
when you came and signed up

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,399
highly encourage you to go see any of

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,640
the other presentations here

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,519
about our projects and other open source

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,160
projects

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,080
this is the great work of emily holland

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,920
and i want to take the opportunity to

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,160
introduce her for the next

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,320
uh segment where she will tell us about

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,839
the news and all that we have

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,839
coming in

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,160
thanks david for that intro um as david

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
mentioned i'm director of marketing

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,560
communications for the academy software

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
foundation at the linux foundation and i

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,240
have been very privileged to work with

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,920
many of the people attending this over

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
the past two years and see the

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,120
foundation really grow

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
and our communities and our projects

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,200
grow it's very

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,240
exciting for me to see how excited all

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
of you get about it

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,560
so um also as david mentioned today we

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,399
announced three new members

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,079
unity technologies conductor

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,720
technologies and symphony

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,279
and then earlier this year we announced

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
amd

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,320
and dockyard technologies so we're

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,160
excited to see

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,040
the growth is still continuing as we

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,040
bring in new members

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,560
in case you did not see it or were not

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,640
on the open color io

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
session this morning open color i o

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,000
version two is now

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
available uh the feature complete

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
version for download

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
and it has a lot of great updates to it

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,800
this is a major

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,399
release that they've been working on for

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,480
three years

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,279
involving three full-time developers at

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,519
autodesk a lot of contributions and

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,880
collaboration across

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,440
many vfx studios vendors

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,160
users so um it's a great announcement

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
take a look

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,519
check it out um and then tomorrow we

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,000
will have an announcement from openvdb

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,760
um at 10 am and it's related to gpu

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,720
acceleration that's all i can say for

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,120
now

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,040
but hope you can join us then um and if

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,120
you do miss any of the sessions

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,000
all of these talks will be posted next

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,000
week on youtube

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
um one of the other big initiatives that

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,839
we have undertaken this year

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,959
is diversity and inclusion um i think we

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,040
all know that

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,120
obviously it's a big issue and it is

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,639
even more so an issue within open source

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,160
communities

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,120
for vfx and animation um so we launched

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,760
a new working group

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
uh earlier this year it's being led by

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
our co-chaired by carol payne at netflix

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,480
and rachel rose at ilm

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,519
and we have had a ton of great input and

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,560
participation

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,680
from many members studios

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,480
across the board and um carol and rachel

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
will also

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
be talking about a bit about this in the

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,560
session afterwards so i'll let them go

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,480
into

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,160
all the details about the goals but um

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,600
we really encourage everybody to please

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,440
you know get involved

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,880
um participate we'd love to hear

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
suggestions and feedback

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,519
um but you know open source communities

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,360
there's no barrier to entry

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,880
um anybody can get involved it's

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,200
available for everybody

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,240
so this we really want to be a catalyst

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,320
for change

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
to encourage everybody to participate

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,519
and now i'm going to turn it over to

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,519
daniel

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,959
thank you emily i will

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,200
just grab control so

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,680
it has been um a very active and busy

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,959
time

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,079
um as david introduced uh we've found

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,079
that in spite of the many upheavals that

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,800
the last six months or the last year in

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,880
fact have brought to all of our lives

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,639
the processes and projects of the

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,760
academy software foundation

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,200
have provided real resilience to uh the

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
activities that

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
we're involved in and all of our

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
projects have been able to continue

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,480
forward

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,320
uh with great progress and success

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,000
i'm going to highlight a little bit of

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
the activities that happen in and around

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
the tack and specifically things that

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,279
have happened

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,639
um that we've been able to initiate

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,839
within the last

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,480
year and particularly six months and

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,480
following uh the presentation i give rob

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,040
will be providing some

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,000
interesting details and the path forward

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,680
so we'll go back

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,560
we'll go through our projects a couple

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,560
of times in the next

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,199
sessions

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:25,600
yeah so um one initiative that we

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,040
really took on um following uh

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
following through in the last six months

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,720
was to take the model that we've been

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,920
successfully using

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,920
to develop technology outside of the

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,480
scope of any of our individual projects

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,079
you saw on the slide earlier that our

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,880
structure for the technical advisory

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,680
council

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,320
is one which brings together all of our

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,160
uh

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
projects and allows us to solve problems

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
and decide on

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,279
policies and direction that uh can

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,240
benefit all of those projects

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,480
so take it in the extra step of spinning

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
up

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,720
a number of working groups which allow

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,399
us to take on other problem areas which

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,560
are outside of the scope of any of

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,000
our current projects you'll see there

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,240
that we have four

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,160
working groups currently active and

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,399
emily introduced the diversity inclusion

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,199
working group which has been doing

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,720
very good work uh in that domain in the

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,240
more technical areas or the more

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
strictly technical areas of course we've

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,199
had the ci working group

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,800
from the very beginning of the

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
activities of the academy software

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,959
foundation

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,880
and that's the model that we've used for

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,800
these other working groups as well

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
we've had we have a very active working

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,360
group looking into open

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,279
sorry universal scene description um and

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,759
how we can add and support

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,800
that project uh which obviously is an

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,000
independent project

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,759
that is managed by pixar and

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,720
a working group established to help

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,399
our members and the broader industry and

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,920
particularly also of course the vendors

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,880
that are associated in our software

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,279
stack

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,040
on the transition from python 2 to

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,880
python 3 which is a problem that's been

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,880
occupied many of us over the last year

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,720
so to dive into our projects now of

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,480
course we have

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,680
six very strong and active projects

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,519
differing in age and in their profiles

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,600
over the last year we've been able to

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,759
successfully

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,920
involve the academy software foundation

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,040
in the google summer of code project in

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,079
fact we've had three students active

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,680
over this period um for openexr

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,560
open timelineo and openq and that's been

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,160
a very valuable uh collaboration each of

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,839
the students has done very good work

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,279
and something we hope to continue in the

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,480
future an indeed a model that we're

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,720
looking for

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,160
looking at ourselves as far as good ways

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,920
of establishing communities

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,120
and supporting and extending those

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
communities around our projects

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,440
so to speak a little bit of each of the

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,839
projects in turn

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,639
and i'll note that all of our projects

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,279
do have

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,199
uh birds for feather sessions within the

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,920
open source days program

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,040
so please uh treat this as a quick

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,519
introduction as a hook

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,160
to go in and find more detail and

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,280
connect with those projects directly

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,039
so openvdb was our first uh project

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,160
accepted and adopted in the foundation

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,600
and i would really like to just leave

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,880
another underlining or underscore

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,439
for the very exciting announcement

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,640
they'll be making tomorrow so please do

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,520
join that session

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,520
it'll be worth your while

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,200
open colorio is another excellent

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,679
poster for uh the broadening of

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,880
support and processes that the academy

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,720
software foundation has been able to

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,480
assist and provide for a

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,760
well-established project

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,440
so um actually being able to bring

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,520
together the resources

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
and the different uh studios and

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,679
companies

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
to allow open color i o version two a

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,280
huge effort

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,880
uh to come together on a schedule that

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,640
was established

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,679
essentially last year for release now

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,919
that's a wonderful effort

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,919
congratulations to all all involved

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:19,120
openq is one of our more recently

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,799
joined or incubated projects and

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,640
sits a little bit apart from many of our

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,160
other projects in terms of being

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
a whole system that works with

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,799
distributed components unlike

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,799
a software library once again its

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
involvement in the foundation has really

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,000
been

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,760
vital to extend the use cases of this

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,720
software to allow

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,240
other studios and technology providers

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
to incorporate it in their

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,640
stack as a solution that can work for

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,360
a broader range of companies and

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,120
the participation in that project as you

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,880
can see from the contributors mentioned

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,240
there

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,360
brings together those different groups

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,720
with different backgrounds in a way that

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,720
certainly isn't possible for any

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,080
in-house or proprietary technology

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,799
which is of course the history of many

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,799
of our projects

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,440
openexr is of course

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
in some ways the grandfather of open

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,200
source projects

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,880
within our industry please note the

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,120
exciting new logo there

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,120
which is which perhaps um

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,559
what's the word i'm looking for the old

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,360
logo

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,039
was old and it provided a visual cue as

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,760
to the sort of uh the date of origin of

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,679
the project

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,280
new logo of course alives that a little

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,280
bit but is a

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,640
a very nice representation of the

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,440
functionality of

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,160
the project and is a good thing to move

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
forward

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,679
particularly as opdxr itself takes on a

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,720
more

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,760
modern face so one of the key

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,000
contributions

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,679
that google summer of code project has

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
made has been able to support some of

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,960
the

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,760
modernization in uh efforts on that

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,000
project

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,679
um specifically recognizing that

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,120
different that as a large project that

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,799
provides different services

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,559
uh that some modularization of its

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,000
libraries uh was

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,840
uh desirable and secondly

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,600
modernization of the code and software

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,919
that's used inside of the project

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,440
so all of those things are going into

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,799
opdxr now

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,280
and will culminate uh with opet xr3

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,880
coming later this summer

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,640
it's been a very it has a very broad

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,200
range of contributions once again

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,120
across a wide variety of both industry

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,760
and studio

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,760
developers

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,039
open timeline oh is one of our uh newer

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,080
projects

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,799
um this has been contributed by pixar of

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,280
course

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:48,799
and sits as a a very good solution to

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,400
a problem that has been um challenging

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,320
again many of our inter-operation

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,200
processes across applications

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,640
um and within studios and their uh

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,640
different creative processes

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
so this is of course in order to be able

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,039
to exchange

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,080
um and encode editorial timeline

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,960
information

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,280
um as another uh interchange project

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,640
it's very well suited to the open source

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,080
model and once again um situating the

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
project inside of the academy software

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,640
and

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,360
foundation has been a key factor in

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,200
allowing

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,960
and encouraging contributions both from

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,880
a diversity of studios

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,880
but also software vendors

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
and

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,480
there we go sorry just have a little

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,880
click glitch

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,600
there um and of course open chatting

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,120
language

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,640
uh joined us quite recently um but as a

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,280
very mature project

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
which was already a very active open

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,640
source project

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,919
uh has continued to make good progress

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,159
in its new home

00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,400
um the process of actually uh

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,840
coming into the foundation from uh from

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,960
certain pictures image works

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,200
has of course um given us the process

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,960
and governance and uh resilience to

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
really allow for contributions from a

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,360
wide variety of players who've

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,799
previously

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,240
been consumers of the project but not so

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,960
much active contributors so

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,919
that's been the real shift of gear with

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,919
the project adoption

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,039
and with that uh i will pass over to rob

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,240
and a reminder of course please uh feel

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,840
free to start

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
posing questions which we will be able

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,120
to cover in the discussion session

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,559
let's see if i have control or not it's

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,080
changing around i can't tell if that's

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,520
me or somebody else

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,320
hold on a second glitch here in control

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
passing

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,280
no problem i'm going to do one more

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,080
request dave and see if that works any

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,039
better

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,600
you should there we go perfect i've got

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,559
control

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,240
well allegedly we'll see try another

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,720
method

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,520
there we go so um i'm going to talk a

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,520
little bit about

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,799
um looking ahead and what we're doing

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,440
next because our goal here

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,159
and we've actually succeeded in our goal

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,240
of really

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
accelerating open source development

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,600
free software development

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,120
for our community for the visual effects

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,960
animation and

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,240
other visually driven cg driven

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,600
communities that serve our industry and

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,280
i'm just gonna i'm not gonna spend a lot

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,120
of detail looking at these specific

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,880
slides talking about

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,559
the number of commits the number of

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,600
releases and the contributors but i did

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,159
want you to see

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,960
um how active each of these projects has

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,600
been just

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,880
in the last year some of these projects

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,400
like open colorio

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
were not getting this kind of level of

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,559
contribution before they joined

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,159
the the academy software foundation um

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,080
in fact nowhere near there was a lot of

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,600
enthusiasm for it there was a lot of use

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
across the industry because it solves a

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,640
really important problem

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,880
but there wasn't the system in place to

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,039
allow contributions from a wide variety

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,799
of contributors and autodesk who has

00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,840
invested a lot in the new version of

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,080
opencolorio

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,960
it wasn't even clear how they could get

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,640
their code

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,159
into the shipping version of open

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,720
colorio or if they needed to branch it

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,159
or need to

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,320
just provide a whole other solution to

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,600
the industry and i'm so pleased to see

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,279
the community coming together and

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,919
contributing as you can see in a huge

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,799
way

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,919
to that project open queue as well and

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,919
when we're talking about this number of

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,919
lines changed in a year this is a lot of

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,039
effort that is going into these packages

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,960
as you can see

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,960
uh not just from a single contributor

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,320
here uh there are a lot of lines coming

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,640
from one but in terms of

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,279
level of commit there's a lot of people

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,640
contributing which is fantastic

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,919
opening xr a project that of course near

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,520
and dear to my heart the one that

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,600
inspired me to get into open source

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
watching how open exr had succeeded in

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,159
the industry

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,520
but a project that hadn't had a lot of

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,960
love in the last few years it was

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,240
getting some security patches but that

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,960
was about it

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,720
as you can see a lot more work in the

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,080
last year 409 commits

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,600
just in the last 12 months open timeline

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,799
i o

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,960
again we're seeing contributors uh

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,799
very actively participating in this

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,960
project uh and not just

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,400
from pixar or unknown studios so we're

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,480
seeing this from multiple studios which

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,640
is what we want to see

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,240
open shading language has been long

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,720
developed very actively

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,919
um you can see larry gritz continues to

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,520
be the uh

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,440
the top contributor to that package

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,279
that's not a surprise it's only been in

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
the academy software foundation for a

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,000
couple of months but it is fantastic to

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,520
see

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,679
more people able to contribute and have

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:34,080
a path to contributing to this

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:37,360
in a new way so

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,000
we want to focus now on

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,440
how we can bring the most value to you

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,080
as people who are either already

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,600
contributing

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,279
already part of the academy software

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,039
foundation or maybe you're here today

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,960
kind of checking out what it is that

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,960
we're doing where's the catch

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,120
um there isn't there isn't a catch

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,799
whether you are whether you are a member

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,159
company in the academy software

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,360
foundation and you're supporting it with

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,960
engineering and you're supporting it

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,960
with money

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,720
or you're not all the software is free

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
for you it's free for you to participate

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
in

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,320
it's free for you to contribute to it's

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,600
free for you to use

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,600
according to licensing but all the

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,880
licenses are very permissive

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,840
so it's all free but the reason so many

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,679
of those companies

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
that we are very very grateful to for

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,120
contributing engineering resources and

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,919
money to making the academy software

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,240
foundation

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
successful the reason that all of us

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,000
have chosen to be a part of this is

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,919
because it's

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,520
so much more efficient for us to solve

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,200
some of these problems together

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,440
than if we had to solve them one at a

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,400
time and you can see the level of

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,679
collaboration

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,440
the level of efficiency that we're

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,799
achieving in the academy software

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,679
foundation today and this is just after

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,760
two years so

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,880
we still have more growth potential

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,919
ahead of us

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,559
it's actually very very exciting so now

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,440
we want to talk with you there's a 122

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,000
of us here

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,279
uh and as daniel and emily pointed out

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,760
please feel free to open

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,080
uh answer any ask any questions in the q

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,679
a box down at the bottom of your screen

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,039
but um i'm curious where has the academy

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,840
software foundation

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,120
delivered the most value to you effect

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,000
effectively where have we been

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,760
successful so

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,919
far and then the next question is going

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,400
to be where can we deliver more value

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,720
what would

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
what would create more value for you but

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,600
just go to that

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,640
uh url at the top on your phone or on

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,799
your device pull

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,720
ev.com a s aswf

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,399
and you can pop in a response and it

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,520
should show up on the screen

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,760
and then um when if you go to that

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,559
website and you see somebody's input

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,399
you can also upvote other people's

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,120
suggestions so you can kind of

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,640
second someone's thoughts so i'm going

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,159
to just hop in there make sure it's all

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,640
working

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,640
i see one that's a good sign

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,520
and we can start talking about these

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,960
actually as they come up

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,960
and daniel's here so

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:03,840
and we are starting to see the responses

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,840
pour in which is great

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,520
this is really helpful because um it's

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,640
hard for us sometimes

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,399
to see the the forest for the trees and

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,440
there's been a lot that gone in

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,200
to putting the foundation together

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,960
but as we discussed before briefly

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,080
um we're at a time unexpectedly

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,760
with copic 19 where we have to look

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,840
again at a lot of things and how we do

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,440
things and it's a great time to have the

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,320
feedback of the community

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,760
so thank you for uh everyone who's

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,279
typing frantically

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,640
at the moment that that information is

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,840
very helpful to us to the board

00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,840
to the tech

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,360
daniel do you want to um jump in and

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,039
chat at all about the build system and

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,919
what the current state of the ci system

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,000
is just because it

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,520
came up towards the top here while other

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,480
comments are coming in

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,520
that's a good hook indeed yes so um

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,720
firstly i'll

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,200
refer everyone to a short session that's

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,799
happening

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,880
a little later in the day i think in an

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,000
hour and a half where we'll be going

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,399
into

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,080
the ci system and the ci working group

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,679
in a little bit more depth

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,840
but essentially uh we have

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:40,640
um been able to with the resources

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,880
of the attack and projects and also the

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,399
participation of some very active

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,520
other members been able to

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,399
take what all of the projects have been

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,559
doing

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,399
in different ways usually inside of the

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,000
studios that originated the projects

00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:01,120
and moved that out into shared open

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,559
modern build

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,120
ci and support including testing

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,120
that's obviously a very good thing in

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,720
terms of the

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,480
modernity and capabilities of those

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,240
systems so i think in almost all cases

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,360
we've extended

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,960
the range of support

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,360
that the project ci systems offer

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,320
in terms of platform support and in

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,320
terms of

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,279
its ability to perform static analysis

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,320
and other kinds of

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,679
uh processes not just a simple build and

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,679
test

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,200
and of course making the testing process

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,799
crucially making the testing

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,320
process of ci visible to all

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,760
contributors rather than just those that

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
are situated inside of

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,200
um you know the wall garden where the

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,480
project might otherwise be

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,159
um be normally hosted

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,960
so yes uh please uh if you have further

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,840
interest there

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,240
uh please either follow the ci working

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,600
group

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,880
uh via the academy's slack channel

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,120
or mailing lists and as with all of our

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,440
working groups and the tac itself

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,919
and indeed all of our projects we

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,039
encourage open participation

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,159
your interest and your expertise is very

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,399
welcome

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,760
great thank you very much for

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,000
highlighting these things i think the

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,559
top

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,240
one on this list that people are

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,320
describing as you know where the academy

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,000
software foundation has provided value

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,360
in terms of keeping projects alive and

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,720
contributable i

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,519
agree with that that was certainly a

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,399
major goal as we looked at the state of

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,240
open source

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,159
just over two years ago as we were

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,799
diving into this and seeing how we could

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,279
help

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,640
um the fact that came up top is uh does

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,840
mean we are addressing a real problem

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,559
which is really good

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,919
um and some of these other things are um

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,640
are very very helpful i think it's

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,240
interesting

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,919
we see legal licensing framework for

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,080
contribution about

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,039
well half as popular as the top one and

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,720
i think that's

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,240
uh possibly something for us to think

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,840
about in the future

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,360
uh we're certainly very focused on that

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,960
problem we've also taken a fairly

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,919
light-handed approach

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,760
there is some good unifor uh uniformity

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,840
a better uniformity across the projects

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,880
but not complete uniformity across the

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,320
projects today

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,919
and that's an interesting one to look at

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,880
and but it is nice to see it up there

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,640
as well so yeah i really appreciate all

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,039
of your thoughts here and we will

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,720
be taking this back to our attack and

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,159
the rest of teams as we look at this

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,000
as we consider our plans for the future

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,440
but it is great to see these areas that

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,679
are moving forward well so now

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,519
uh where are the things how can we bring

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,960
more value how can the academy software

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,640
foundation create more value

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,080
for you um and one of the just to keep

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,760
in mind as you're filling this one out

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,720
as you're coming up with ideas

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,559
um as we've continued to increase our

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,320
membership our member companies that

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,960
provides us engineering resources

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,640
it also provides funding so we can use

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,640
that funding for various things

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,039
um you'll hear a little bit more about

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,120
that in the dni program

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,399
how we anticipate being able to fund

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,440
that we have

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,799
uh lots of uh ideas about how we can

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
move forward but part of it is

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,640
most of it is going to be driven by the

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,240
community where you direct us

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,279
uh to focus our efforts where we can

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,720
bring the most value for sure

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:24,240
so i'll give this a minute i'll fill out

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:26,320
a couple myself

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,760
i love seeing attracting diverse

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,640
engineering talent to the motion picture

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,399
industry

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,440
i think we do sit in a very unique

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,600
position to be able to do that

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,960
i think the accessibility of this our

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,320
ability to

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,000
find talent that we as an industry have

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,360
not been able to find or not have

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,600
traditionally been very good

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,519
at finding i think as an industry we're

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,720
missing some of the top talent

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,080
out there and our ability to stand in

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,840
that gap and attract their

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,440
that kind of diverse engineering talent

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,039
would be a huge

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,880
uh thing that we can play and i think we

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,559
can play that role as a software

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,279
foundation as the academy software

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,120
foundation i think

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,480
we can play that role in a way that

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,320
really complements

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,760
some of the initiatives that many of our

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,000
member companies are also doing

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,000
internally

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,839
when i look at the investment disney

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,800
makes in the academy software foundation

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,679
it's actually quite efficient it's a

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,720
very

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,040
nominal contribution for a lot of value

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,320
and i think that especially if we can

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,240
add a lot of

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:35,119
value in this area i think that would be

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:38,480
a really good story

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,079
i'd like to see the mansion providing

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,040
more adoption guidance for smaller

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,240
studios

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,119
yeah in fact at um

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,639
prior to cohen we were looking at our

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,839
second year and

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,599
we had in our plan to to focus on the

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,359
smaller studio and

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,160
we will come back to that at some point

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:01,920
but i'd be very interested to hear about

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,400
the smallers from the smaller studios um

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,280
here

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,240
in suggestions of what we can do or in

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,440
the qa session

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,720
afterward about your

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,760
your perception of the foundation and

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,640
how we can help you the the studios that

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,839
are

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,040
um doing a lot of work in our industry

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,400
the smaller studios very innovative um

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,079
also very busy and so your your efforts

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,680
and your money is

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:35,359
is a great value in your time

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,800
so how um how can the foundation help

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,240
you what do we need to do

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,839
how do we need to evolve to serve

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,280
from our point of view the whole

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,960
community and

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,960
that includes the smaller studios

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,720
i might uh this is a

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,119
maybe a good challenge for us in terms

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,880
of using some of the other mechanisms

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,160
that we have for questions and answers

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,520
but um i would

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,160
might encourage uh people who have

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,880
highlighted the official binary builds

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,800
um

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,599
point there to uh add some more aspects

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,160
to that in the q

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,599
a section or in the chat um curious

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,640
there whether those

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,640
uh requests are coming largely for

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,119
uh mac and windows platforms or for uh

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,599
for linux as well and secondly whether

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,200
that

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,320
uh is uh an interest in essentially

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,200
um components and packages along the

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,599
lines of

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,560
uh sort of individual elements or

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,160
looking for

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,599
sort of larger integrated environments

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,280
for you know the whole set of sort of

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,320
tools the vfx reference platform in

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,800
binary form essentially

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,119
yeah and feel free if the q and a format

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,640
which is nice one for asking questions

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,079
but if that doesn't work feel free to

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,280
chat us in the chat you can chat just to

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,920
the panelists or you can chat to

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,240
everybody

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,760
in in the room you know it's a good size

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,400
group but it's still less than 100 or

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,839
131 of us including the panelists so

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,680
feel free to just use that chat

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,240
if that is a helpful way to communicate

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,240
back on that

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,000
we've had a lot of discussion about data

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,480
set provision providing data sets

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,920
and we think that this could be a very

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,320
useful mechanism be

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,200
just like in the rest of the open source

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,440
code

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,200
licensing if we had a common licensing

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,720
scheme that people could know they could

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,800
donate data to

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,079
and it could be housed by the academy

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,839
software foundation

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,920
uh whether that's for machine learning

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,320
or whether that's for um

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,520
render testing or other sort of data set

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,359
test data sets

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,359
that um sometimes are quite significant

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,359
uh we've seen some examples where uh

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,960
walt disney animation has open source

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,400
some very large data sets that have

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,400
gotten a lot of use in the industry

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,079
especially in research

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,480
so that is something we've talked about

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,760
but we have not yet started that project

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,480
um so that is an interesting thing to

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,640
see i i like seeing that high on this

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,079
list it's definitely something that

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,240
i think we could bring some real value

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,680
to

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,680
and i'll chime in too because i'm seeing

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,599
you know a lot about the increasing

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,359
learning learning materials and

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,280
accessible resources and

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,160
we'll talk about that some of the dni

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,320
session but that is a big goal for us

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,640
um as well because you know that is a

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,200
way to help attract diverse talent

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,960
um and i will say that a lot of the

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,599
projects are already working on this but

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,000
that is an

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,800
area where we could definitely use help

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,960
and it's an

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,079
easy way to start trying to get involved

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,760
with the foundation you don't

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,720
necessarily have to be very technical to

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,440
do that

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,200
um so you know if that's something you

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,880
might be interested in helping

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,560
out with you know please feel free to

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,160
reach out to me to any of the projects

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,000
on slack

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,280
you know all of our communities are very

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,480
welcoming and would

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,480
welcome help in that

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,160
and i'll go ahead and answer satish's

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,359
question i hope i said your name

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,000
properly or at least

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,040
close um the question is are there any

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,200
plans for some

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,800
shared usd data sets production quality

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,240
data sets for usd

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,520
um so we we've discussed it we've talked

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,960
about how we would implement that and

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,760
there are some good examples

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,520
inside of the linux foundation where

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,040
that has been done successfully

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,040
on other in other uh in other domains

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,320
so we have a mechanism that we could use

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,880
for that but we haven't actually gotten

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,920
that first

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,400
project off the ground we discussed a

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,079
human

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,520
data set but that's a pretty changeable

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,040
data set meaning

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,720
the kind of data people are looking for

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,920
in that space changes pretty rapidly

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,320
because all the research is happening

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,320
quickly

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,000
but and we had talked about a couple of

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,480
heavy render sets that could be useful

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
as well

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,160
for researchers so if you have interest

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,560
in that project don't hesitate to reach

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,680
out

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,359
to any of us um because that could be

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,560
the difference between that a specific

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,160
project getting off the ground in that

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,359
area or not but this is this would be a

00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,560
good time for us to look at that for

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,480
sure

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,599
oh and nick just highlighted in the chat

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,839
nick cannon

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,520
uh who is a cto over at walt disney

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,000
animation he said the usd version of the

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,160
moana island scene is coming soon

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,359
so that is a that is a fun uh thing to

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,960
know

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,200
then we have a question from graham

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,359
benjamin um definitely need a good

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,440
open source assets for testing that

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,800
everything is set up

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,319
maybe some assets could come from the

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,560
smithsonian institute

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,240
yeah i'm interested in how fran is

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,079
imagining that i could

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,400
totally see that there's a lot of

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,200
amazing data the smithsonian institute

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,280
has

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,640
made available and has licensed very

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,400
freely so we

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,000
could certainly imagine some

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,119
applications for that i guess we have to

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,880
figure out what part we would be

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,200
bringing to that specifically

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,319
uh whether we'd be digitizing some

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,400
things that are viewed from multiple

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,640
angles and creating 3d models from it

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,319
or whether or not um whether you're just

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,119
looking for like some nice clean assets

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,720
that you can test

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,400
pipelines with it'd be interesting to

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,839
talk to you more about that perhaps

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,000
chime in in the chat if you wanted to

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,240
follow up on that one friend

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,760
let me just this is fantastic i really

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,440
appreciate this input

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,119
i love to see that we're looking that

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,640
in this group right now the top thing on

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,000
everybody's mind is attracting diverse

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,800
talent to the motion picture industry

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,960
and i i

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,720
i feel that pressure as well and i think

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,640
we're in a very very good spot to help

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,240
enable that that is a great segue

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,480
to the one o'clock session that starts

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,960
in just just under 20 minutes

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,480
because that is that team has some

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,599
fantastic ideas there's a ton of

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,880
enthusiasm

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,400
and there's a lot of support from

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,839
everybody in the academy software

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,400
foundation to help enable

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,599
that in everything we do um so i'm

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,359
excited to see that

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,599
and then the fact that the fx reference

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,680
platform is top on the list is great too

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,359
uh getting all those projects aligned is

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,079
a big job but we can definitely help

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,000
with that

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,520
and uh there's a lot of enthusiasm for

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,079
that as well

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,079
well that as well outlawed that on the

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,839
vfx reference platform um engagement

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,960
that's something of course that

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,200
is already uh happening in various ways

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,400
we have some sort of shared membership

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,880
and liaison

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,920
in that group across the two um sets of

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,280
activity

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,160
and the b uh one of the um

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,200
goals and indeed the outcomes of the uh

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,079
ci system

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,280
um that we have developed is of course

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,200
to provide

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,040
uh concrete workable uh recipes for the

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,079
specifications the vfx

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,520
vfx reference platform actually um

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,560
encodes uh as a result we've

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,440
moved from not only capturing the sort

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,160
of currently

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,920
and historically established vfs

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,800
reference platform editions

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,440
uh but we've also been able to uh use

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,560
the

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,599
uh the ci and its underlying docker uh

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,640
build system

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,960
um to validate um the uh

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,560
reference platform proposals and that's

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,680
that activity has actually happened in

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,520
the latest iteration of the

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,880
reference platform and indeed sort of

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,640
allowed us to uh

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,880
troubleshoot some of the combinations

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,200
and other elements of the platform

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,720
um i'll hook put a hook in again of

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,839
course for both the

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,160
uh ci working group session later in the

00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,800
day

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,400
and of course the vfs reference platform

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,079
is also having a session within the open

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,520
source days program

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,400
great so um we will get to a couple more

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,160
questions in a minute

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,319
continue to throw those in there if you

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,839
would like on the questions area

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,160
just in terms of how you can get

00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,920
involved if you're not involved already

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,319
you can jump in and contribute to an

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,800
existing project anytime

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,079
um so that's there's a list of what six

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,000
or seven bullets there have different

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,720
ways you can jump in right away

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,160
um and there's room for various for

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,520
people with various level of technical

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,440
proficiency as well

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,960
it does not just require you to be a

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,560
hard code coder

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,560
to be able to contribute so there's lots

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,000
of roles uh to be able to contribute to

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,400
an existing project

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,920
um the tac as we've highlighted as you

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,240
can see in our charts it's probably the

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,319
most

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,720
it's probably the the it's the beating

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,720
heart of the academy software foundation

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,800
and you can see some specific needs we

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,000
have on the technical advisory committee

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,240
but that is really

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
um the group that daniel runs is really

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,760
where all the action happens

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,920
the rest of us are here to support that

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,839
and to amplify everything they're doing

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,960
and then most recently the new working

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,880
groups the ci

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,040
working group the diversity inclusion

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,400
working group python and usd working

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,000
groups

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,920
these are all areas where you can dive

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,839
in and contribute in many different ways

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,960
um i just want to explicitly mention

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,960
everyone is welcome

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,560
in the diversity and inclusion group

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,720
even if you are not

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,599
part of a minority community or you

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,359
don't identify

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,000
with a minority community of course you

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,720
are welcome to be part of the dni uh

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,240
working group uh we need everybody we'd

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
love everybody to be involved in that

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,560
and

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,240
it's not just that working group's job

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,760
to help solve that within the academy

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,040
software foundation we think of it as

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,200
all of our jobs but this

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,040
working group is making some fantastic

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,880
recommendations and setting us up

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,839
and giving some really good ideas for

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,839
how we can proceed

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,680
and i'll leave this up as we're diving

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,040
into our last questions

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,880
lots of different ways to get in touch

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,200
with us of course there's the website

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,720
where you can find links to all of this

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,560
but these are the various things so you

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,839
can pick your favorite method to be in

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,800
touch with people on the academy

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,800
software foundation

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,560
so we'll take a couple questions if

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,079
there are some and then we'll give

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,880
everybody a couple minutes to get ready

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,640
for the next session as well

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,400
um i think this one's maybe more of a

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,720
comment than a question but from

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,520
uh naren and i apologize i'm butchering

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,440
the name but

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,119
related to the data sets for machine

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,560
learning if studios

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,560
are not willing or hesitant to

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,440
contribute the data at least the trained

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,880
models probably can be open sourced

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,480
that's a very good point yes

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,000
i think that's a really good point and i

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,480
think you know it's interesting if

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,440
the if we're looking to host trained

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,960
models

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,920
that could be something we could look up

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,760
as well um and we could expedite that if

00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,359
that was easier to get done so i'm open

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,480
to that for sure

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,280
i'm sure the attack would be open to

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,240
looking that i mean

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,680
and then steven mckenzie asked is there

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,359
a place that can be gone to to

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,280
understand which projects

00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,800
academy software foundation projects are

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,839
looking for which kinds of

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,880
development help so that developers can

00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,560
better evaluate

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,160
you know how they can help in the most

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,800
constructive way

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,440
and jean francois pointed out we do have

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,839
a good

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,800
first issues uh most of our projects are

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,599
encouraged to

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,000
tag those yeah so if you're already

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,960
familiar

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,440
with github and you go through the

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,200
github issues list you hopefully will

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,040
find some good first issues tags

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,560
in there that you might be able to jump

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,800
right into um that

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,920
that said feel free to jump on any of

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,480
the slack channels

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,119
or in any of the mailing lists and you

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,040
if

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,400
if you were to highlight a couple of

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,720
things that you're good at

00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,319
um i'm sure there would be several

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,520
responses from people that said oh

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,319
here's a place you could contribute

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,400
right away

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,760
or if you did that on the open exr

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,800
mailing list and there wasn't anything

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,240
directly for you

00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,800
the people that hang out on that mailing

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,839
list also know uh something about some

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,599
of our other projects

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,040
and they might be able to say oh your

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,760
gpu skills are going to be really

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,640
relevant

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,960
coming soon over an openvdb or whatever

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,400
the

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,800
or whatever might get announced tomorrow

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,319
morning so um

00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,160
definitely feel free to chime in with

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,720
any specific questions uh

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,760
if you have interest or expertise um and

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,040
then of course if you can't reach

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,720
anybody there just

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,720
jump into attack meeting or jump on the

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,720
tech mailing list and say hey i'd love

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,000
i'd love to help i've got a few hours

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,400
and i could do this

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,960
uh there's all plenty of work to do we'd

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,079
love that kind of uh request

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,760
seconded yeah and i'd say the talk

00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,640
meetings are open to everybody you do

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,119
not have to be a tech

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,480
member to join but that's a great way to

00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,079
find out what all the projects are

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,760
working on and kind of

00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,440
um maybe what's on the roadmap because

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,960
each project will give an update as long

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,880
as well as each working group

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,000
so i think that's a very good first step

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,599
and there's also a

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,599
tac channel on our slack

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,920
then anonymous is apple actually still

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,920
an

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,680
academy software foundation member uh

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,280
because they're not on the member page

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,200
and i can answer this one that yes they

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,079
are still a premier member uh there are

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,920
some logo

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,680
guidelines from apple that prohibit us

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,440
from putting their logo on our website

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,559
but yes they are and they are actively

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,480
involved

00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,720
in many of our projects and on our

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,720
attack

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,520
that's great

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,000
well since we have the one o'clock

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,359
meeting since we've gotten through most

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,040
the q a and since we've got so much

00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,800
great input i wonder if we should wrap

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,720
this one up giving everybody a couple of

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,079
minutes and really highlight

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,200
that the dni discussion that's coming up

00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,800
at one o'clock

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:48,240
if you're able to take part in that we

00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:51,119
would welcome you for sure

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,720

00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,680
leadership of attack

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,440
has been exceptional now doing that for

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,040
two years which is a really big job

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,960
i think we may have convinced him to do

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,000
hit this by telling him that it wasn't

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,880
that big of a job

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,079
uh yet he has done a heroic a heroic job

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,119
managing it all

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,400
