	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
welcome folks this next session is on

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,200
asus development

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
we're going to be talking about aces

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,080
here and uh

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,960
just for those who are unaware asus is

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,559
the academy

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,440
color encoding system and

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,320
it's used in movie making so a good deal

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,520
of folks

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,279
are uh using this for their color

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,000
management at the end of their pipeline

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,599
for

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,439
getting stuff in from the cameras and

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,279
then back out to different kinds of uh

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
displays and deliverables

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,880
and so uh the reason that we're here

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
today is that we wanted to give you an

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,320
update of where we are with asus

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,879
and also uh to let you know how our

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
process

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
works in an open source kind of sense

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,520
because

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,120
we are similar in a lot of respects

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,719
to other projects that are in the

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,360
academy software foundation but as it

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
turns out

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,800
asus is not yet in uh the aswf

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,719
it's something that we look forward to

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,920
but when we originally started

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,160
each of these processes aswf and also

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,400
some new stuff with aces it was kind of

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
a parallel path and so we've taken a lot

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,360
of hints from the way that aswf

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
is played out and more that discussion

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,560
will happen

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
as we go but we wanted to make sure that

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,479
we had

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,759
something rolling and we'll eventually

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,400
hope that we will be

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,080
one of the projects that is under uh the

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,479
foundation

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
uh so uh the plan for today is that

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,720
we're gonna go over a lot of that

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,759
development process with scott dyer from

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,000
the academy

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,280
and then chris clark from netflix is

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,320
going to be speaking from the point of

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,400
view of a

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,240
virtual working group that's what vwg

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,479
stands for as a chair

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,880
and then the perspective from uh chris

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,000
bergeon who's a member of the virtual

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
working groups he's going to talk a

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,880
little bit about

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,159
how that worked and how what it's like

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,840
to be involved

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,240
in aces as a participant

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
and uh then of course we'll have a q a

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
at the end

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,119
uh but the important thing is that we

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
want to make sure that you have an

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,640
opportunity to get involved and so

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,360
asus is uh a big project there are a lot

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,840
of sub

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,039
parts that are being worked on

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,399
simultaneously and

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,080
there's a lot of opportunity for

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
contribution from a lot of different

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,599
kinds of people so yes we need

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
programmers but we also need people who

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,920
are practitioners

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,319
and so we're looking for a lot of

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,680
different kinds of folks and so

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,360
let's make sure that you have a chance

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,000
to get involved and we'll talk about

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,040
that more

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
as we go uh so

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,239
let's go ahead and get started i'm going

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
to hand it over to scott

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,319
and we'll kick it off with the asus

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480
development process

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,680
all right thanks rod um hello everyone

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,720
my name is scott dyer

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
and i am a senior imaging engineer with

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
the uh

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,519
academy emotional picture arts and

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,000
sciences science and technology council

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,200
and i work a lot on aces and have been

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,200
around uh

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,720
for about 10 years so i can tell you

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,080
about our old process

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,959
uh a little bit which led up to aces 1.0

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,560
which was released

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,519
uh toward the end of 2014. so

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,440
um the old process the perception with

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
that uh it was a little bit mystical to

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,760
those on the outside

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,599
those not in hollywood uh directly uh

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,920
you know we weren't taking advantage of

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,599
very many tools that we have now and so

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
it seemed very much like an academy

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
project and

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,519
not a community project and um

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,200
processes and decisions were kind of

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,400
detached from the users

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
that uh actually put this into their

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,440
movies

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,720
and implement it and so we want to make

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,760
sure we wanted to make sure that

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,920
in uh as asus continues to develop

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,360
we switched our process to be more open

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,799
and community driven

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
uh because who's better to tell us the

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,879
needs than the actual users of the

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,319
system

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,879
to tell us what's what works what

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,599
doesn't what would make it work better

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,200
and to go along with that of course you

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,319
need some oversight because what's good

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,799
for one

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,560
very vocal user somewhere in the world

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
might not be good for all users and so

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,720
we need someone or a group of people

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
to oversee and make sure that the

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,159
overall direction of the

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,000
system maintains aligned with the goals

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,640
of aces and so we have a structure that

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
will look

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,560
a little bit familiar to those know how

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,760
aswf is set up

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,359
so next slide please so here is just a

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,600
little overview of uh

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,040
the simple organization chart of how the

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,840
new process is set up

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,440
uh post 1.0 and as we move toward an

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,040
aces 2.

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,759
up at the top we have an aces leadership

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,479
team and that's composed of uh

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,600
rod and uh his vice other vice chair

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,720
their vice chairs

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,960
and annie chang is our uh aces chair

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,479
at the moment so and and then also on

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,040
that is uh some

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,960
academy staff and below it we have two

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,680
architecture tech there are two

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,639
technical advisory councils one of them

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,280
architecture

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
one of them implementation and those

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
have different focuses

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,800
and beneath those and i'm going to

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,720
expand on those on the next slides but

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
beneath those we have the working groups

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
and the working groups are really the

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
core

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,080
of the community driven effort that's

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,880
where all the work

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,400
actually gets done and those are

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,360
temporary committees

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,440
of participants and users that exist

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,400
until their specific work items

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,240
are completed and they deliver their

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,240
group's output and deliverables

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,360
up to the parent tac and the tac reviews

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280
it makes sure that it

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,120
fits in the way that they're responsible

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,520
to make sure it fits into the system

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
and at that point we uh integrate it

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,759
into

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,199
the aces project so next slide

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,120
talk a little bit more about the working

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,120
groups which really are the core

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,039
and then we'll hear from actual people

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
who have been in the working groups

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,160
uh so these are where you do the actual

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
engineering

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
development documentation and other

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,440
tasks that are essential uh for creating

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,639
new features

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
and integrating them into the aces

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,080
reference

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,680
uh code and things like that uh these

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,039
are done with regular meetings that are

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,400
held via web conference

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,000
so that's where the vwg abbreviation

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
comes up you might see a few times

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,080
throughout this presentation those are

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,199
virtual

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,440
working groups we no longer uh have you

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,479
know

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,520
physical meetings uh all we used to have

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,280
these be physical

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,560
in hollywood and it was kind of

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,240
localized because it was very hard

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,319
people around the world to join those

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,520
obviously if they're not in town when we

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,720
have those meetings so

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,560
we have regular meetings via web

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
conference those are all recorded and

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,479
posted online

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,160
uh for review for those who missed it or

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,880
want to go back and revisit some of the

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,199
conversations that we had

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,319
and each project is given a home page

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,400
where we collect

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,520
relevant documents to do items and sort

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,759
of track the progress

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,800
of each one of these individual working

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,319
groups

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,880
and furthermore we have a discussion

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,520
area on our asus central community forum

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,479
where

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,120
conversations can happen uh between

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
meetings

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
and where uh we have an archive or

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,800
record that we can go back and search or

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,120
see kind of the development of an idea

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
and

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,120
the contributions there before we work

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
it into a final product

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,479
so participation in these groups is open

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
to anyone

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,160
willing and able to contribute they're

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,919
all done online and

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,039
links to the meetings and information

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,240
are all available on asuscentral.com

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
uh and you can also create a group so if

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,039
you're a user

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,800
who has a need or something that you

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,440
think is important to the system

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
that needs to be addressed um you can

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,319
form a proposal for

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,639
a fill out a proposal form available on

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,759
our site and submit it

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,880
to uh start your own working group uh

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,720
really to do that

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,240
we asked hopefully that there's some

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,759
sort of socialization of an idea and

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
it's not just some

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
like little pet pet project that you

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
want to do but if you're passionate

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,120
about it and there's a reason for

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
us to do it uh the tac parent tack for

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,840
that particular project will

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,440
consider it and make sure that it's

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,360
lined with the goals of aces and then we

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,919
can get a working group going

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,440
um these are intended to be short-lived

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,240
and issue based we don't want these

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,199
working groups

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,919
dragging on forever so the the more

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
focused

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,440
and um clear the deliverables the better

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
we want these to be uh to be formed

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,520
solve a problem and then

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
conclude so we can move on and address

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,319
other

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,800
working groups and kind of keep these

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,479
things moving forward

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
and finally when the working group has

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,599
completed their work as mentioned before

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,680
they they submit a status report and

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,039
throughout the progress of of their work

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
and then at the very end they present

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,200
their deliverables to the parent

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,200
technical advisory council so next slide

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,240
i'll talk about the tax themselves a

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
little bit

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
so these are comprised of industry

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,399
experts that have a broad understanding

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
of motion picture workflows

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,399
and the impact that those workflows will

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560
have on their organization's objectives

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,680
and these people are pulled from

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
studios and production companies large

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
stakeholders

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,920
in aces and people who

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,120
the decisions made about aces really

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,880
will impact

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
how their work gets done and the

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,760
supporters of aces and they want to make

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
sure that it succeeds

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,240
these are also practitioners people are

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,120
using aces in post-production vfx

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,399
editorial archiving game studios have

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
become very important

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,880
users of aces and just general color

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,279
scientists and subject matter experts as

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
well

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,640
so these all make up the tax we have a

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,519
good mixture of

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,360
different backgrounds and people and

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,360
they're not really responsible for any

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,760
engineering work they're really there as

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,640
oversight to provide guidance and to

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,560
make sure again that the

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,680
working groups are aligning with the uh

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,880
design and goals of aces so

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,880
um architecture tack primarily is about

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,880
the architecture so that includes core

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,200
transforms encodings

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,080
file formats uh metadata things like

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,880
that uh

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
that are sort of about the system design

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
and

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
they uh they oversee that kind of stuff

00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,360
and then

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,880
obviously once once an idea or an

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
algorithm or a transform has been

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
created

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,519
that actually has to become available to

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
users uh and so implement the

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,079
implementation tag is really

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,760
focused on how the architectural

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,240
elements of aces then get

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,200
put into end user tools uh are

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,200
documented

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,920
and delivered to users and so the um

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,880
architecture tech really or the

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
implementation tech

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,240
is is important to make sure that these

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,920
can actually

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,160
these ideas that the architecture comes

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,440
up with can be implemented and

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,720
there's no issues there uh

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,240
next slide so the leadership at the top

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,760
level as previously mentioned is

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,160
uh annie chang rod bogar and jackie zell

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,040
are our chair and vice chairs currently

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,079
and then also

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,200
on there is uh scitec staff

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,240
and consultants and really these people

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,760
are at the top level they're there just

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,880
to kind of define the overall project

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,519
strategy and to keep

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,079
things focused uh aces leadership is

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
responsible

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,399
for allocating resources uh defining

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
work items and prioritize

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,600
prioritizing the limited resources that

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,440
we do have

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,880
for all these various working groups

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,680
that are ongoing

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,320
at any given time and also communicating

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,320
this stuff

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,040
uh through marketing efforts and with

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,279
asuscentral.com

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,640
uh next slide all right so

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,320
i said there's there's a lot of things

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,959
that were very similar to the

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
aswf structure the organizational

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,959
hierarchy

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,480
the use of technical advisory council

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,120
to oversee the projects and we really

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,600
want to

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
have it be open and community driven so

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,839
that's definitely

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040
key connections there to aswf but

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,399
there's a few things that

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,120
keep us from being exactly like that

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,360
because aces is a system and it's very

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,279
complex and has many components

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
and so it's much more difficult to kind

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,680
of put that into just

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
a single project that could probably be

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,279
easily

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,399
ported into aswf at some point because

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,600
there's software all these tools

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,519
integrate aces into their products

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,920
much like those were on the ocio call

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,959
you know that ocio gets put into a lot

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,120
of different uh

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,320
software applications and things but

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,040
aces

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
is also a big part of ocios there's a

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,360
lot of this cross overlap

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
and how to do that exactly is is still

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,639
being determined and there's still

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,240
a lot of development going on in asus

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,079
itself um

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,519
and there's no dedicated engineers from

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
uh the companies everyone that

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,560
contributes to aces is doing so

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,120
uh a volunteer or with approval i guess

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,760
from their

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,920
uh companies to to dedicate some time to

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,560
uh contributing to aces efforts

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,920
and so uh we also have this product

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,920
partner program

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,519
uh which is a way that we've come up

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,120
with a mechanism to

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,959
help provide a little bit of guidance to

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,680
software manufacturers and vendors who

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,160
want to say they support aces

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680
and for for whatever their tool might be

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
their product category whether it be a

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,839
color corrector or a camera

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,120
or display there are different criteria

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,000
for them to meet

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,360
which we believe helps show that they

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,480
ensure a high quality ace's

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,880
implementation

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,279
so it's uh ace is very complex and uh

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,240
we're not exactly sure uh you know how

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,320
to how to

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,360
reconcile that but we have a couple

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,519
people with us today

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,560
like chris clark who i'll introduce

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,639
right now he's going to tell you a

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,399
little bit about his experience

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,000
running one of these working groups in

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,839
the past and also

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
as a participant so i'll turn it over to

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,240
chris now

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,800
hello everyone um i'm chris clark i am

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
a manager of imaging technology at

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,760
netflix

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,440
and i was one of the guinea pigs for

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,279
this new process uh for asus next

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
um and like others on this call i've

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,000
been involved with aces for

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,040
um i think about 10 years now

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,680
um where you know in the early days i

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,560
would call it

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,680
um the development activity was mainly

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,639
in person

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,800
um you could dial in i think i remember

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,839
kodak dialing in from rochester new york

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,199
in the early days

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,199
so you can definitely different time um

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,959
but back then i worked at a studio so

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,279
many pictures that

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,800
um you know care deeply about its

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,720
archive and

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,040
being owned by a technology company was

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,000
thinking about things like hdr and so

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,079
asus was um was a priority there and and

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,720
so we used it on some early

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,360
feature films where it kind of required

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,760
a little bit of

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,160
tribal knowledge and um custom things

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,959
and i think it wasn't really until 1.0

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,279
when

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,880
it was much more widely supported and

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,519
things were built into

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,560
a lot of different products and um

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,680
around that time i

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,680
moved over to netflix and um and here

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,279
we're trying to

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,120
build this global studio we have

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,639
offices all over the world and

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,639
productions all over the world

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,040
and so we really look to open standards

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,680
because a lot of what our group does is

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,760
identify

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,680
technology that everyone can use no

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,000
matter where you are in the world and

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,560
whether it's a blockbuster film or a

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,920
little docu-series or a

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,000
korean zombie show

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,639
you know we we want color management to

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,079
kind of be a fabric that everyone can

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,160
um can use so um

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,279
now we're in this phase of working

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,000
towards 2.0 as scott mentioned and

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,040
um it's been it's been exciting to be

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,839
more involved and

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,839
and um i had the opportunity to to chair

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,120
one of the one of the first groups

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,320
uh next slide so

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,600
um the first group that um

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,440
that i was chairing was the asus

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,199
metadata file uh

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,959
group which was formerly called asus

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,360
clip um

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,240
and like i said i was kind of the guinea

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,880
pig so

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,440
you know and you know annie and rod and

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,120
everyone was

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
was honest about that the fact that this

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,880
is a new process and

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,199
it's there's lots of room for

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,639
improvement and part of what

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,480
sharing the group is going to be is is

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,680
providing feedback on on how things are

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,720
going

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,560
but basically the the groups are

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,240
i would say academy organized but

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,880
community driven so

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,839
the academy will handle uh things like

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,079
setting up the

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,839
the go-to meetings for all the calls and

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,920
and recordings

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,440
um they have asus central essential

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,079
areas within there that

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,519
are dedicated to each group's work as

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,000
well as a

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,519
dropbox paper kind of workspace where

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,639
you can post files and

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,320
documents and things like that but i

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,240
would say these middle two things

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
um getting people involved in

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,680
maintaining scope those two are the main

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,399
core responsibilities i would say of a

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
of a group chair um getting people

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,040
involved

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,720
you know some of that is organic with

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,559
with people that are

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,559
interested in the the work that's going

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,360
on or they may have a product that

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,760
they're

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,559
planning on implementing it in or just

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,559
really eager participants

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,400
but some of it really is targeted

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,559
outreach because

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,439
not everyone knows that these groups are

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,480
publicly

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,919
open and anyone can can be involved and

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,520
so

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,880
some of it is letting people know that

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
this is going on and here's what the

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,400
meetings are

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,960
and now the academy has a really

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,440
convenient calendar where you can

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,400
see when all the meetings are happening

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
so that's that's

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,240
part of it the second part is

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,280
maintaining scope

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,160
so when you start a group you're

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,440
proposing

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,000
an idea and and a goal

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,039
and what happens when you get all these

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
really smart people

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,400
on a call is that people start to you

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,039
know

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,640
expand scope and try to solve all the

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,480
production problems

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,400
and so part of the chair's

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,520
responsibilities is maintaining that

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,360
and really focusing on the core

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,240
goals of the original proposal

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,160
and the last part is this bridge between

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,520
the architecture groups and

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,360
the implementation group the

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,200
amf group that i was sharing was an

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,880
architecture group because it was

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,160
designing the specification that is amf

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,320
but i i really had to be there for the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,840
second group that started because

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320
there's obviously going to be questions

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,240
about design choices and

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,440
um what the architecture group was

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,640
thinking when they

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,640
made the spec and so i think for

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,919
any group that's that's starting up it's

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
important for

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,600
um ideally for someone on the

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,960
implementation side to be

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,640
listening in and keeping an eye on the

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,679
architecture and then for people from

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,760
the architecture

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,600
side to be part of the implementation

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,120
discussions

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,960
um and as far as future improvements um

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,559
i think we're already seeing a lot of

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,240
improvement in some of the

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,679
the new groups particularly the gamut

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,480
mapping group which

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,760
has done a really amazing job at

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,559
summarizing meetings

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,919
for people who who miss them they are

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,039
recorded but

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,440
they've been doing these little

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,240
summaries of of the key points

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
things that had consensus during those

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,559
meetings

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,760
things like that and also providing

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,880
progress supports for you know months

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,080
long of work and

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,840
kind of summarizing milestones or things

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,480
that

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,679
they've achieved another one is

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,960
time zone accommodation because

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
like i mentioned this is an

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,000
international global

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,120
project and so we have tons of amazing

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,679
people joining from

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,559
all over the world and in order to

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
accommodate that

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,679
that gamut mapping group has been doing

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,799
alternating times so

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,640
some mornings some evenings and so

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,320
um because they're recorded people can

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
join ones that work for their time zones

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,840
and watch the others

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,520
on their own time and the last thing

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,039
is chat so we

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,200
we've been talking a lot about it and i

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,919
think scott and alex have already been

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
looking at

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,280
options for chat but really just

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,799
improving the ways that we can

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,919
communicate when we're not on the

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,360
meetings and

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
keeping track of all the work that's

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,000
happening

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,840
and just having kind of more flow of

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
consciousness

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,440
chats going so i think that's in the

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,520
works now um

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,720
i think scott and alex might be able to

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,559
answer questions about that

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,919
later but um that's i think about it and

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,559
so now i'm going to introduce

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,960
the other chris uh chris bergian who's

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,559
going to give his perspective on

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,240
being a participant in these groups

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:59,039
thanks hi everyone i'm chris bridgeon

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
dave lighting at elimination mcguff i

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,159
was responsible for the acc

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,960
implementation at our studio and wanted

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,679
to share with you

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,919
a quick quick app about it i'm going to

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,840
focus today especially on full cg

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,320
animation studios and the benefits you

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,000
can have from using aces

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,000
first it allows you to work with an

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,679
industry standard which is very

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
helpful for exchanging files and

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,480
deliveries

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,080
secondly ac set things straight when it

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,080
comes to terminology

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,480
in color management the use of accurate

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,960
terms is highly recommended

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,360
and at last but not least aces actually

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,880
makes your renders look better

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,880
if we have a look at the two examples

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,440
below on the left we have a linear

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,559
render

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,640
displayed with srgb transfer function

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,080
on the right we have an accg render

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,039
displayed with the srgb

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,200
ac output transformer we can see how the

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,440
area light and its influence is much

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,760
more interesting in aces

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,440
just just look at the shape of the red

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,559
sphere and the falloff on the green

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,880
plane

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,880
pretty cool right next slide please

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,200
let's scroll back a bit my first

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,320
experience with aces was on lego batman

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,240
at animal logic in sydney i was blown

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,760
away by the quality of the image and the

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,520
extreme saturation

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,960
i didn't know much about color

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,760
management back then

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,559
but i felt something was just right

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,600
started to watch

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,960
videos and ask questions about aces if

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,159
you are new to this field

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,000
i would recommend to watch the

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,080
excellency graph 2015 video by alex fry

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,760
who was compositing supervisor on the

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,480
lego movies

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:39,440
next slide please back to paris in 2018

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,799
i had one idea in mind implementing aces

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,799
outdoor studio

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,159
i had to face some challenges some

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,360
challenges so

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,760
i didn't fully grasp what was acs i just

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,600
knew

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
it looked great from my lego batman

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,280
experience

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,080
our supervisor were used to linear

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,480
workflow why would they change

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,840
there was lots of misconceptions about

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,320
linear

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,960
and there was no osceol implementation

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,559
in our proprietary softwares

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,559
i didn't know it back then but i was

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,240
about to start the most fascinating

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
two-year journey with one of our lead

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,280
developers

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:18,000
christoph verstaryana next slide please

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,080
we had to face many obstacles but i have

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,520
learned so much in the way

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
here's a couple of hints from our

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,600
experience

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,440
first of all don't try to convince

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,799
anyone if you don't fully understand the

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,000
topic

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,080
secondly we realized that one of the

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,840
biggest misconceptions in the industry

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,280
was about

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,880
linear that it was some sort of color

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,159
space that would give you access to

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,760
infinite colors

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,200
not at all thanks to the asus community

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,559
we defeated old mysticism linear

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,200
is a transfer function not a color space

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,159
this may sound trivial or basic but it

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,640
was a giant

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,679
step for us thanks to the aces

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,240
terminology

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,440
everything is much more explicit and

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,559
clearer

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,480
linear is now utility linear

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,640
srgb next slide please

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,679
one of my tasks was to convince my

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
supervisors

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,240
i really had to dig deep in into aces to

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,039
find a proper way

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,600
i started with the most obvious reasons

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,320
ac

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,799
is a standard developed by the empaths

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,960
yep

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,159
the people from the us cars didn't

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,559
convince

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,880
aces has been used in more than 300

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,679
movies and is a standard for netflix

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,120
he didn't convince sneezer aces is

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,080
currently used by many

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,880
vfx studios such as elm animal logic or

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,640
frame store

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,000
didn't convince finally it is this one

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,760
sentence that tipped

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,120
the balance in favor rendering in accg

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,760
brings us closer to spectral rendering

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,840
let's have a look at the kernel box in

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,720
the next slide

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,559
on the left we have a linear kernel box

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,520
and on the right we have an accg

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,360
render if you look at the green sphere

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,919
on the right you can clearly see some

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,200
red bouncing from the wall on it

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,520
thanks to the wide gamut rendering same

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,240
thing

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,799
on the red sphere next slide please

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,400
i have done probably hundreds of tests

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,640
comparing different display

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,799
display transformer one of the most

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,360
interesting was the following one

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,640
we compared the macbeth chart displayed

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,240
with the spyenim lot

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,279
versus the rec.709 aces output transform

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,919
and increase the stops to compare

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,720
at 6 stops you can clearly see what is

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,000
happening

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,400
the color 18 which is cyan does not go

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,320
to white with the spioning i found it

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
fascinating to observe that this

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,039
particular color 18 is

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,799
outside the srgb gamut knowing that the

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,480
chart is used in many

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,960
look dev assets worldwide asus 2.0

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,039
should

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,080
even bring more improvement on different

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,000
aspects

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,840
such as gambit mapping and output

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,880
transforms

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,400
next slide please i've been an aces

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,320
mentor quite recently and has been

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,880
following the gamut mapping virtual

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,480
working group with great interest

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,799
i've actually been learning a lot

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,400
because this group is quite technical

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,080
but i think i've been able to follow

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
asking questions around reading some

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,840
articles

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,760
and interacting on ac

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,600
we generally generally connect through

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,159
go to meeting at specific hours

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,000
it's really great and easy to use anyone

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,600
can join and participate

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,880
and you get to listen and learn on

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,039
specific topics from these great minds

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,880
next slide please yeah thank you every

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,760
week the group shares it new goals and

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,600
milestones

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,679
trying to see what our options are

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,000
comparing different solutions

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,799
it is a slow process that takes time but

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,960
it's pretty much

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,000
enjoyable since you can actually

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,880
experience the progress

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,559
that has been made week after week it

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,480
feels great

00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,919
to be part of this community i know it

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,279
can be intimidating

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,919
at first to post on ac central but

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,440
i have felt welcome since day one you

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,000
can you actually feel like you're part

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,000
of something

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,840
that is bigger than you and that

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,840
hopefully will improve the work and

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,200
quality of thousands of artists

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,279
out there next slide please

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,039
i would like to thank the asus community

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,880
christopher esparya and xavier beg for

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,960
their patience and support

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,320
more informations can be found on ac

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,000
central and on my website

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:34,080
chrisbridgeon.com

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:37,520
thanks for watching

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,480
great thanks chris so uh we want to

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,760
bring it back to

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,120
uh where we're headed here with aces

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,480
and uh where we're headed is asus 2.0

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,120
and so we want to talk a little bit

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,200
about what that means and

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,159
and what's active and what you can get

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,760
involved in so

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,440
there are some implementation groups

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,559
that are currently working

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,080
um and this is the way this

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,840
happened originally was that we had

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,440
architecture groups first and then

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,480
implementation groups after and so now

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,279
these are the ones that have

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,960
uh spun up and are are getting work done

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,640
and so that's the asus metadata

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,320
file of course and then the common lut

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,240
format which was also mentioned earlier

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,559
in the ocio talk

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,600
and i definitely want to thank uh doug

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,840
patrick carroll and

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,520
michael for uh all the nice aces

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,159
mentions during their ocio spot

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,520
uh talk earlier um we also have an input

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,919
transforms

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,799
uh group that's working on what it means

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,279
in order to take

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,919
content from the camera in however it

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,399
captures

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,200
into to get things into basis and so

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,200
we're trying to

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,720
make sure that we have good uh best

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,480
practices around that

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,960
in the architecture group the gamut

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,159
mapping group was mentioned earlier

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,880
these guys are making great stride in

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:54,480
figuring out how conversions from one

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,200
space to another can possibly

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,399
occur with minimal amount of clipping or

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,240
artifacts

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,159
and the reason this is important is for

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,200
the upcoming group which is for output

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,240
transforms

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,799
because one of our goals when we first

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,320
started

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,279
this new asus next basis 2.0 process

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,480
was that we wanted to be able to well we

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,840
went around and we asked a bunch of

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,240
people a bunch of questions about this

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
we did

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,120
what we called the listening tour and

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
one of the main things that we heard

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,679
back is

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,360
it would be great if the rrt was

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,960
invertible and would be great if there

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,039
were some parameters associated with the

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,039
way that output transforms worked

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,399
and so that's where we're headed and a

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,480
lot of these other things have been

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,039
staged towards that so we're on our way

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,679
there

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,360
and that's the big next group here so

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,360
let's go to the next slide

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,679
um we want to make sure that you can

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,399
come

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,880
and be involved asuscentral.com that's

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,039
the

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,720
website there at the top is got a new

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,919
look and a new layout and there's a lot

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,279
that you can see about

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,159
one example here is that we have the

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,679
asus logo program which is a way of

00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,320
uh highlighting which products really do

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,880
meet the needs and the requirements of

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
each of the

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,440
facilities that they're doing and so

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,480
we're adding additional partners there

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,679
but if you join asus central you can get

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,200
involved immediately

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,880
you can certainly do the discussion

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,520
forum questions like chris just

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,960
mentioned

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,200
where you ask a question if there's

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,559
something you want to know people answer

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,200
quite quickly and you can get yourself

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,840
uh up to date pretty fast but you can

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,360
also

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,960
immediately join any of the meetings

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,520
that have been mentioned uh the

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,919
all the working group meetings are open

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,520
as well as uh the tac meetings so if you

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,240
want to attend an attack meeting you can

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,159
certainly

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,840
listen in uh it's still tack business

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,399
and so um

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,159
we would try to keep the the the

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,000
distracting discussions to a minimum but

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,559
at the same time all that is open to you

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,640
too

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,799
and so it's one of our goals here with

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,679
asus 2.0 is that it all being

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,640
transparent

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,679
and open and give a lot of access to

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,760
folks who

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,919
can who normally felt like they were a

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,320
little bit distant in this process

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:07,039
so next slide regarding the logo program

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,799
uh as as mentioned earlier there are now

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,320
31 members so that's hardware and

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,240
software implementations and so that

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,279
includes a lot of big names

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,600
for companies but in

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,760
in particular it is their products it's

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,440
not just a company that gets this

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,960
so we do um assign the product

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,559
per per product for the logo program

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,480
and then we've also added the service

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,679
provider tier and that's

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,120
that was something that we were missing

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,880
before because we generally had this

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,279
around well it's a camera or

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,960
it's a a piece of software that that

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,000
does color conversion but

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:46,080
um also dvi excuse me di

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,559
vfx and dailies all need to be able to

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,120
have criteria for the quality that

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,600
they're doing

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,559
so we want people to get involved with

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,840
the working groups

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,159
we are looking for as we say new energy

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,880
and it's mainly folks who are passionate

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,679
about this

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,360
if you really it matters to you that

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,440
your content looks right and that you

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,480
have some unique situation that you're

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,159
delivering to

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,679
we still want to make sure that we get

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,480
to uh

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,840
the situation that you need and that

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,640
we've got you covered and so we're

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,679
really trying to

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,960
listen to as many diverse

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,399
use cases as we possibly can but we do

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,399
need programmers for reference

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,960
implementations but we also need

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,880
people who can evaluate the quality of

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,320
what they're seeing

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,039
so use the discussion forum get get help

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,120
and give help

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,039
and please participate in the working

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,480
group discussions

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,760
so uh

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,440
it's time for some discussion and q a if

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,720
anybody has questions we right now

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,519
don't have any in the q a chat but we

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,519
certainly can

00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,640
uh make up a few if

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,320
if if none of our audience is going to

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,159
ask anything in particular but uh

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,760
i'll i'll hover for a moment and allow

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,159
that to happen so that somebody can type

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,519
and hit return

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,559
but in the absence of that um i'm gonna

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:21,120
uh go back to scott for a moment

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:24,720
um can you talk a little bit about um

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,919
the the feedback that we got from

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,080
um what we called the rae group

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,000
because we didn't mention that as being

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,600
a

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,559
uh yeah sure um i it's hard for me to

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,760
come up with all the

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,399
specifics but a few uh i guess

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,120
maybe two or three years ago now uh

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,720
probably two

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,960
uh we had a group of uh very

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,480
um well many of them are involved in

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,960
many of these projects uh

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,000
good users uh feedback they kind of got

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,000
together

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,279
uh discussed a bunch of things about

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
aces that

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,120
they saw as areas that could use some

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
improvement

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,000
and related to that was not just

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,280
architecture of the system or algorithms

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,720
uh but really included um the process

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:16,240
stuff as well and part of that was

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,320
you know the archiving discussions and

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,119
and having a record of where decisions

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,399
came from things like that and it was

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,720
really

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,000
great feedback and very important for us

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,280
to hear

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,599
at the time because i mean it was

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,240
something we always wanted to do but we

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,320
really just

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,760
didn't know how to do it and we've been

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,240
figuring that out um

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,960
we've spent we responded to that uh that

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,919
paper

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,440
it's it's on um the original paper if

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,240
anyone wants to review the the bullet

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,800
points and stuff

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,440
there's a thread for it on

00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,119
asuscentral.com you can just

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,159
go to the search and type in rae or

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,599
is that rie stands for retrospective

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,400
aces enhancement or aces retrospective

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,119
and enhancements uh paper or something i

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,520
believe

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,520
uh it's sorry it's been a little while

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,680
but there's great feedback in there very

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,720
well articulated uh concerns

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,880
and um uh requests for

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,280
for more openness and things like that

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,240
and so that really did um

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,760
trigger a lot of these re

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,560
reconfigurations that we've we've

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,880
undergone

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,000
and we're still learning you know as as

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,640
chris said his group

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,440
was one of the first ones to go active

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,920
under this

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,359
new structure and you know we every time

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,400
we do this we're learning a few things

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,560
to tweak

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,280
uh how to how to run it better the next

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,800
time there's a link in the uh

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,440
chat now great thanks uh so yeah it's

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,040
it's very good feedback in there and and

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,320
that really did inspire us

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,760
for many of the things that we've been

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,640
trying to implement and if you look at

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,520
their their

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,920
list of what they were asking for i

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,119
believe

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,280
we've pretty much addressed

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,200
most if not all of them at this point uh

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,160
except for obviously

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,240
having an asus 2.0 but that's underway

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,040
and and that being like a revision to

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,240
the actual

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,640
uh output transform architecture the the

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,760
look

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,119
if you will of aces uh the basic

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,160
rendering transform and that is

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,960
something that is a

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,520
huge task and will be a huge shift but

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,119
we are

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,760
working on on getting uh to that in

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,320
the next year so great that would be a

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,040
scottish

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,079
task a few questions in the chat box

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,160
there rod um

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,920
yeah i see that it seems like there's a

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,119
couple things about timeline so maybe we

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,800
should uh

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,040
kick off a couple of those discussions

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,480
so um

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,720
so one of the things that we didn't

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,560
mention about the uh virtual working

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,000
groups is that each of them

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,160
has a an academy staff member that is

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,160
associated that keeps track and so

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,079
alex and scott tend to be those

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,200
individuals and so they're on different

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,480
ones

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,720
for gamut mapping if you could give the

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,599
the kind of rough timeline information

00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,680
that would be helpful

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,599
since that's one of the questions yeah

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,720
so um all of the timelines really are

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,800
driven by the

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
individual deliverables that those

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,640
groups are are working on

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,560
um in in particular the gamut mapping

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,359
group is sort of closer to finished

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,480
than it is uh the start they're in the

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,599
process right now

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,880
of optimizing parameters associated with

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,560
a candidate algorithm

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,400
and doing some real-world testing

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:32,160
um so carol payne who's driving

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:35,440
um that group with mattesh strassenburg

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,720
are in the process of putting together

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,520
a proposal for how they go about doing

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,560
testing

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,280
and then once that testing is complete

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,960
they'll

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,320
reassess and determine whether or not

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,520
they need to make

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,760
more changes to the algorithm itself and

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,760
and then ultimately uh produce a

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,800
deliverable an algorithm deliverable

00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,000
and um and present that to the tac

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,040
um so uh sort of long story short i

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,119
guess is that

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,119
the timeline depends on the deliverables

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,160
and uh they are closer to

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,680
finished than they are um uh

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,000
the start right but but it is not

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,040
this is not many months away right it is

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
still

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,200
this is looking to wrap up um this fall

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,280
i believe

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,720
yeah i i think this fall seems like a

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,000
reasonable timeline

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:31,040
yeah likewise there's a question about

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:34,640
um the timeline for idt

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,160
and and

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,640
well i'll actually read this question

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,440
because it's uh it's more than one thing

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,240
which what is the timeline plan for

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,359
adding

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,240
formal support for a film idt into

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,920
asus and will this be part of the idt

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,520
virtual working group and what timelines

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,200
can we expect for any movement

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,520
so i think what this is getting at is

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,040
that the idt is

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,119
how do you get from the space of

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,200
whatever you captured to become into

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,560
asus and what if the thing you captured

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,839
is film um so

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,520
what would be the timeline for that and

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,640
i think it falls into the same heading

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,560
as

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,320
what we want to do with the idt group

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,680
which is just getting started

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,320
is uh determine how

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,079
the testing should be confirmed and to

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,400
guarantee that for example

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,960
does every camera have to reproduce

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,480
exactly the scene the same way which is

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,880
sort of unrealistic and so how do we uh

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,240
where what are the compromises and and

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,920
and whatever the

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,760
mitigations that we do for the different

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,000
vendors and

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,599
i would note that that film is supported

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,240
in asus 1.0 um

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,880
there are uh two transforms in the color

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,160
space

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,040
conversion um transforms directory

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,280
uh one called adx10 to asus one the

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,079
other called adx16 to aces

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,720
those um it can be effectively thought

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,440
of as

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,880
film idt's we would like to make

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,040
improvements to those

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,599
uh but it is supported in asus 1.0

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,359
right but it does it does need another

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,480
pass particularly in the presence of the

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,480
other cameras

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,920
and now that they're going to be more

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,200
unified we'll want to make sure that the

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,720
film one is more unified too

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,040
uh so let's make sure that i covered all

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,720
that

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,920
um and so timelines again for

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,200
idt that one's just getting started so

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,680
uh we're hoping that that'll kick off

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,960
soon and in fact there's there have

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,839
already been a couple of initial

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,520
meetings

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,720
and that should hopefully only take a

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,680
couple of months

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,599
but with all these things there is a lot

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,319
of hardware testing that needs to happen

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,920
and

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,520
in the absence of people being able to

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,800
get into the same room at the same time

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,079
that has become a little bit more

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,920
challenging

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,160
so there have been some delays due to

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,480
that that are unfortunate but that is

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,920
uh something that i think still we feel

00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,720
like we want to be by the end of the

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,359
year

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,040
um alex can you talk a little bit about

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,800
the general

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,880
uh aces 2.0 timeline in general for our

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,920
target release

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
yeah so we're um we're still trying to

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,119
figure out

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,480
exactly what the features are uh for

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,839
asus 2.0

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,280
or a series of asus 2.0 releases and um

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,000
how we plan on going

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,119
about releasing that uh so it is a

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,599
little bit up in the air

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,400
um we previously said that you know we

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,440
were targeting

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:36,960
um uh late 2021 for for that kind of um

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,920
release but um everything's a little bit

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,000
up in the air right now with um

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,920
the change in the world and the change

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,880
in the ways that we're working so

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,160
um take that with a grain of salt uh

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,359
here's actually a good question

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,720
from uh satish goda um it says uh do

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,960
asus and ocio

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,960
uh collaborate and if so how

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,240
do you wanna touch on that ron uh yeah i

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,680
think that is an important one um

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,400
one of the i think there's a lot of

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,640
overlap

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,319
between the the members of our groups

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,480
and the members of their groups

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,240
and so to some degree there's

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,359
collaboration just because a lot of the

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,680
people are the same

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,119
but at the same time we do specifically

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,920
talk with the asus

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,800
uh the ocio leadership and the asus

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,000
leadership

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,240
um partly for timing you know when is

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,480
their release when is our release

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,599
what other concerns are we they're doing

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,800
i would feel like

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,880
um to be honest the ocio is

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,920
an implementation of what we've

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,760
delivered

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,000
and so they want to be aware of what

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,000
we've cut coming

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,800
and and then they're one of our best

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,200
uh kind of implementation groups you can

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,000
imagine the ocio is like a product

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,359
that contains asus and it makes it

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
available to others and

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,480
implements the standard and makes it

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,839
available and so

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,920
they've been one of the best quickest uh

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,920
implementation partners for us and so

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,119
yes it is a good collaboration and i'm

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,480
really pleased with the work that

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,480
they've been doing there

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,560
um and so they've they've really made

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,560
aces available to a lot of folks

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,359
and i think that was that's really been

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,800
helpful for us

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,800
uh let's let's

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,720
just i was just gonna try to answer a

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,160
question from carol payne about

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,280
how to join in that one over yes please

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,280
where to get up to date on their

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,599
progress that's a great question um

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,200
we hinted at it earlier in the

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,839
presentation but um

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,920
essentially uh if you go to uh

00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,160
asuscentral.com uh

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,520
you can find links to all this stuff so

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,880
i'm gonna hopefully be able to do this

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,319
real fast i don't know

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,560
um okay it worked you can

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,319
see my my safari screen yes all right

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,079
great so in here uh this is

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,680
asiancentral.com this is the home page

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,680
that you'll get when you leave that up

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,040
if you go up to the top uh of the menu

00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,920
bar there's a thing that says working

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,079
groups

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,760
and if you go there there's a working

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,599
groups home page and that way it kind of

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,480
gives you an overview of all the active

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,319
working groups

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,920
and has links directly to each one of

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,839
their their home pages

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,359
uh tells you who's chairing it when it

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,839
was started and

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,640
its purpose and just as it's basically

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,720
its log line

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,720
equivalent uh you can also go directly

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,319
to them on the menu by going to the

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,680
active groups and if you want to go to

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,040
say the gamut mapping group you can

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,280
click on that

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,560
and it takes you to this dropbox paper

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,760
site which is what we've been using

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,280
because it's kind of a live

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,319
uh site and and kind of lets us do some

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,400
cool things and really

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,560
so this this has an overview of sort of

00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,200
uh lots of stuff that the group has been

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,760
doing

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,720
there's uh information on here about the

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,480
work in progress

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,839
uh that's going on and there's this

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,119
little table of contents on the side so

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,880
if you wanted to jump down to the past

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,400
meetings because you can see

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,599
here for example there's been 24

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,040
meetings in this group they've been

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,079
meeting weekly so that's why there's

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,839
been so many

00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,760
uh and if you jump to one of those

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,960
they're doing a great job of putting

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,319
summaries uh on asus so everything here

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,319
is linked and this is a way you can get

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,920
up to speed on what's been going on

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,599
there is a lot of information especially

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,760
for this group because carol

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,720
uh and matthias have been doing a great

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,960
job uh

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,560
documenting their progress so you can

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,480
really see kind of just a bulleted list

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,920
of what happened in each meeting and all

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,680
that stuff so this is a way you can go

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,480
and catch up on any groups that interest

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,599
you

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,599
and uh really asuscentral.com is the the

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,520
jumping off point for any of this stuff

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,200
so go there and check it out poke around

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,240
and if you have questions feel free to

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,280
uh ask us

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,359
later uh and we'll be happy to

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,800
scott you want to show the calendar i

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,800
think the calendars

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,200
oh yeah do that uh yeah

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,560
yeah we didn't realize we'd have time to

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,960
to show the website so much

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,400
but i think this is a great uh well

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,560
scott's bringing that up i'll also just

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,240
throw into that there are uh recordings

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,640
of every meeting and a transcript

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,640
uh so you can watch the the recording

00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,599
and jump around the recording based on

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,720
the transcript

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,280
so that's kind of a neat feature

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,240
yeah so let's see i'll just go to a

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,760
different group here

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,800
um so like calendar we have

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,160
oh my goodness i think on the

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,920
asus central resources oh sure yeah yeah

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,440
the one on the actual aces

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,280
that's a great idea yeah so if you go if

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,680
you go on the asus central home page

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,200
again

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,720
thank you chris i don't know i don't

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,280
even know how to navigate no

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,000
here it is calendar click calendar boom

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,240
there's this thing

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,200
and you can see an overview of when

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,720
these are each

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,880
uh working group has its own little

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,720
color and you can go and see

00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,720
like oh the gown mapping group is

00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,880
actually meeting tomorrow at 5 pm

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,560
pacific and you can actually click on

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,000
that and it'll give you a link right to

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,960
all the relevant information so you can

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,599
see upcoming uh

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,960
events uh and meetings including the

00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,119
session we're in right now so

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,000
yeah it's always up to date with uh all

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,920
the various goings-ons with aces

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,599
all right cool thanks chris thanks a lot

00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,200
scott that's super handy

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,079
um we had a question from uh clairefox

00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,760
uh

00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,240
can you speak about the role that moving

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,000
image archivists play within the group

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,920
i'm curious how the relationship between

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,119
stakeholders in production and in

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,800
archiving

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,359
has been developing in practice and

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,880
i i'm still going to hand this off to

00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,599
scott and alex for most of the answer

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,760
but i

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,960
do want to say that archiving of aces

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,240
has been a big

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:31,200
aspect of where we've gotten to today

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:34,319
that the standard for the asus container

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,640
and uh that went through symptom

00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,640
a lot of these things were with a mind

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,480
towards what it means to do archiving

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,559
and so we also of course in our partners

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,520
folks like chris clark who are at

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,680
netflix

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,720
also care a good deal about archiving so

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,640
we

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,839
we have worked within the studio system

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,960
i think largely

00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:58,319
for how archiving works uh but i've let

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,960
other folks jump in here

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,559
um actually chris did you want to kick

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,680
in anything is there anything

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,880
information that you would add on the

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,160
archiving front um

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,079
no i think that was a good summary i

00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,559
think every studio has a slightly

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,520
different

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,400
approach to archiving but um i know the

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,920
academy has

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,000
has always been um you know a

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,880
an advocate for having a strong archive

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,800
with things like the digital dilemma and

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,079
a lot of work done there so i would

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,280
actually

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,480
um bounce it back to alex or scott to

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,559
see if there's any

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,480
work in terms of academy preservation

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,480
how that relates to uh to aces

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,040
yeah i would just say that um archival

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,079
is obviously a very important aspect of

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,400
aces

00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,760
and we're always looking for

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,240
participation from

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:53,359
people who specialize in in archival um

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,400
that that's getting that viewpoint into

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:57,200
the discussion

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,480
is i think critical to making sure that

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,000
we develop

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,119
an architecture which doesn't

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,240
um unintentionally

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:11,280
cause pain down the line for

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,280
uh for the archive

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,599
yeah thanks one of the things that

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,520
wasn't mentioned is that

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,720
asus is under the governance of the

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,079
academy itself

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,599
and there's something called the science

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,000
council and the science council does

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,680
have

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,040
archive members on it and so

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,040
there's a lot of awareness and

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,480
discussion that happens at that level

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,839
as well so it's so i think the answer is

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,119
yes it's active

00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:41,760
but any more involvement that you can

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,720
and would like to provide we would be

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:48,160
encouraging you to do so

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:51,040
uh so uh a quick question here

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,760
in the middle is uh is the raw to asus

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,680
project still being actively developed

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,520
and i'll admit i don't know the answer

00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,960
to that so i'd like to know

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:04,319
too so i'll jump on that um rod asus

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,960
uh we lost our academy developer a few

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,800
years ago

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,240
um who was working on that and and

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,000
fostering that along

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,240
um so it's been a little bit of a

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,040
dormant state since then but that being

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,400
said

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,280
we're looking at ways to not only

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,400
reactivate that project but also move

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,359
that project

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,400
to a home that might be a little more

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,599
appropriate for it

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:31,200
such as the academy software foundation

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,839
um so i don't want to pre-announce

00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,520
anything yet

00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:38,640
but um i would maybe

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,520
keep an eye on marota aces it's a

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,359
project that

00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,200
a lot of people got pretty excited about

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,960
which was really just a skunk works

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,440
project when we started it at the

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,440
academy

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,520
okay so uh last question that's

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,800
currently in the in the q a is an

00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,760
interesting one is

00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,480
uh do asus workflows have a bigger

00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,119
impact

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,400
on the cg world than in 2d and

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,119
presumably 2d

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,880
may just mean camera capture but uh

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,839
which is how i'm going to interpret the

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,119
this question i and then continues to

00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:11,520
say i ask this because

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,240
online resources mostly speak about

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:17,440
setting up a cg pipeline which is great

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,440
but i'm curious to know more about

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,880
transitioning to aces and a 2d shop that

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,640
does not work with

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,760
cj and it's a good question because the

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,000
original

00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,880
motivation for asus was a good deal

00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,079
about

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,319
image exchange between

00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,559
facilities and at the time many of those

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,319
facilities were visual effects

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,280
facilities and so a lot of cg was

00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,520
involved

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,880
but it had to do with there was a lot of

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,800
live action and then

00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,000
how do you hand something to someone

00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,760
else and make sure that they're seeing

00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,119
things the same way

00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:54,000
and so yes it's uh

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,319
that's the genesis of this whole thing

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,079
uh

00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,680
but when all said and done asus is used

00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,400
on projects that are

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,440
simply just how do i get i've got three

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,680
different cameras

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,599
on a show and i want one kind of

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,520
deliverable that makes sense

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,040
and so there's been television shows

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,079
with no visual effects at all

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,599
which had been entirely using spaces for

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,720
their pipeline

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,839
so it's it's shown up

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,319
as the more common need was how do

00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,200
we make things that are different look

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:29,280
the same

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,599
or and as well as how do we all make it

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,280
look

00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,760
good in the end when there's a

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,240
deliverable all right

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,599
i yeah i'll allow anybody else to answer

00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,440
but chris you might have some good

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,359
perspective from a studio

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,119
yeah i was just gonna uh the way i

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,720
interpreted that question was mainly in

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:49,200
the context of animation

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:52,800
um 2d innovation versus 3d animation and

00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,760
i think if that's the way it was it was

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,640
um asked i think what we found at

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,400
netflix because

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,960
we do have a lot more animation projects

00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,680
now is that the tools used to

00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,040
create cg animation support asus more

00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,559
often than the 2d

00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,359
tools and so that's that's a bit of a

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,240
blocker for

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:14,559
certain 2d projects to jump over to an

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,880
ace to fully aces pipeline

00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,839
i'm sure a lot of people listening have

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,839
tried

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,920
uh you know doing asus and photoshop and

00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,640
it's difficult at best

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,440
so you know there's areas for

00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,319
improvement definitely in terms of

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,359
the tools and you know adobe software

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:34,960
things like that for

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:37,760
for 2d to to utilize aces

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,880
yeah no okay good good point and

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,720
actually the original

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,720
uh poster there if if that

00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,400
if you can clarify whether or not we got

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,839
to your question

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,680
via one of the two answers that we're

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,000
given um that

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,200
that'd be helpful but uh at this point

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,960
it looks like we don't have any

00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,559
additional questions that

00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,640
are on the table and we are coming

00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,000
towards the end of our time

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,240
so maybe this would be just a good time

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,520
to wrap it up here i certainly want to

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,480
thank all the speakers

00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,319
and and all the folks and very much all

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,480
the folks who have been involved in asus

00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,480
along the way there's been a lot of

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,960
contribution from a lot of different

00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,760
people

00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,920
and it's been really great to see uh

00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,480
when we kicked off this asus next effort

00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,079
we weren't sure how it was going to go

00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,520
because we were doing a lot of

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,359
experimental things and as

00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,040
chris clark some people were guinea pigs

00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,040
as we were learning how to do it

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,079
but i do really feel like we've made a

00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,040
lot of progress

00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,400
and has been very successful and and

00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,319
it's really great to see

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,240
the the uptake and the the

00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,240
adoption of asus in general into

00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,559
products as well into projects so it's

00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,839
been

00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:48,240
that's been really terrific so thanks

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,240
everybody

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,480
and i think we'll let let our folks

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,760
wrap us up however it is that this thing

00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,359
ends

00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:04,160
it probably just all goes dark that's

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:04,160
