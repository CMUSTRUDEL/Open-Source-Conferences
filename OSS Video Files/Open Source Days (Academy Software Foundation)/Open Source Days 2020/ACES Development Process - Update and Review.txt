Join ACES community members including a working group chair, working group participant and ACES team members as they discuss their recent development and integration efforts. With a new development process influenced by the ASWF development model, the ACESNext efforts have included two ‘minor’ releases (ACES 1.1 and ACES 1.2) with significant work now underway toward ACES 2.0. Bring your questions to add to this lively discussion of successes, challenges and how you can help.
