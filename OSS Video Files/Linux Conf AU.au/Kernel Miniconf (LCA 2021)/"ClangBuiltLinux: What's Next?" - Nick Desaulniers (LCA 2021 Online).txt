2020 saw further adoption of LLVM for building Linux kernels by Linux distros, kernel developers, and CI systems.  But what tradeoffs exist, and what should be the focus of 2021?  Come join us for a quick retrospective of 2020, help us review outstanding work to be done/what use of LLVM unlocks, and learn how to get involved and participate in kernel AND toolchain development.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
