The idea behind resource control is to distribute resources between workloads so that machines can be shared among different tasks without them interfering with each other - be that service and management tasks on a server, or a web browser and a build job on a laptop. While developing and deploying resource control strategies at facebook to improve reliability and utilization, we've encountered many surprises and had to relearn what we thought we already knew.

Resource Control Demo (https://github.com/facebookexperimental/resctl-demo) is an interactive tool which documents various aspects of cgroup2 resource control using live resource contention scenarios. This presentation gives a tour of various cgroup2 resource control mechanisms and strategies using resctl-demo.
