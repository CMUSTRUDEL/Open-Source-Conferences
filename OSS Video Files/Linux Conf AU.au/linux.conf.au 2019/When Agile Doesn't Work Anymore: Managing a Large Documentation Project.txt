Title: When Agile Doesn't Work Anymore: Managing a Large Documentation Project
Publication date: 2020-01-09

We all age. Some more gracefully than others. Our documentation ages, too, and sadly it's not always glamorous. Docs that start out as a thing of sartorial elegance can, many years and patches later, become tired and sad and badly in need of retirement. Sometimes the content is so out of date and incorrect, the format so anachronistic that it needs to be consigned to a recycling bin. But not all documentation should be euthanised. Sometimes, it just needs a face lift.

Agile documentation is, by its very nature, piecemeal, which can make it difficult to maintain a large documentation suite, and almost impossible to perform a large project that requires meticulous planning and extensive testing. In this talk I'll cover situations that require a complete documentation overhaul, how to go about planning for and undertaking such a project, and (perhaps most importantly) how to sell a Waterfall-style project to your Agile Product Owner.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

[Applause]

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:11,219
thank you very much this talk is called

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,700
when agile hit when you when you present

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,710
her fails it's definitely filing sales

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,710
it's not it was working a minute ago

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:41,680
when I drop files hey we all age

00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:44,620
some of us age more gracefully than

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,780
others our documentation ages as well

00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:52,449
and again it's not always glamorous

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,510
Doc's sometimes start out as this thing

00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:56,409
of sartorial sartorial elegance it is

00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,140
late in the day isn't it

00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:01,720
sartorial elegance and then many many

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,080
years later and many many patches later

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:09,039
they become tired and sad and badly in

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,670
need of retirement sometimes the content

00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:15,759
is so out of date and so incorrect the

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,729
format so anachronistic that all we can

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,020
do is put it in the recycling bin

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,170
not all documentation should be

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:27,369
euthanized though sometimes it just

00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:29,380
needs a facelift the documentation suite

00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:32,320
I'm currently working on is one of these

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,630
the content is great it's been lovingly

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,250
maintained by an interesting interested

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,829
group of engineers for a really long

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,659
time interested and interesting the

00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:42,970
suite got a structure reorganization

00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:46,119
about three years ago it got converted

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,950
from docbook xml to a skew dock and put

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,899
through a new tool chain and they meant

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,790
well they had the best intentions but

00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:56,290
what really happened is it wound up

00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:58,990
still badly organized but differently so

00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,969
to give you some context the product I'm

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,549
working on it's an agile team they care

00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:06,880
very much about doing agile the right

00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:09,190
way and while I have been and still am a

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,780
big advocate of agile documentation

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,489
practices in fact I have no doubt that

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,709
at least some of you have been to one of

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:17,920
my Argyl documentation talks in the past

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,370
I was instantly faced with a dilemma

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,440
with this particular documentation suite

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,120
this was a documentation suite that

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,410
required really big structural changes

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,109
those changes were going to have to be

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:37,630
based on solid research and really good

00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:38,500
sorry okay's on solid research and it's

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,290
going to have to be based on best

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,180
practices so the engineering team and

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,160
the larger Doc's team were going to need

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,790
to be engaged and they were going to

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,349
need to be some

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,200
port of of the changes if we were going

00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:51,909
to be able to get them through also we

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,280
wanted to implement some tooling and

00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:55,989
some publication changes as well so it

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,090
was really important that we had a lot

00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,739
of rigorous testing through the tool

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,909
chain as well as the documentation to

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:06,730
ensure we were delivering the right

00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:08,650
thing so first of all the first thing

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,629
you want to do is is do a proof of

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,939
concept of some description it's

00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:14,829
important to get the lay of the land but

00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,269
it's also about building engagement with

00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,389
other teams this is a word you're gonna

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:22,180
hear me say a lot today engagement I

00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:23,919
took luckily at Suzhou we we have what

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,189
we call hack week twice a year and so I

00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,569
used to have we used my hack week to

00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:31,000
basically sketch out a proof of concept

00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:33,159
for our documentation took a week did a

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,319
really rough review of the existing

00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:38,109
content identified the key areas that

00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,650
needed work and develops a really rough

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,389
idea of what the docs could look like

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,310
this was literally printing out tables

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,379
of contents highlighting them to

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,760
indicate how the content didn't flow

00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:50,229
correctly and that kind of thing so I

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,690
could show someone a picture of a

00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:54,489
highlighted page and go see where we've

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,889
got green yellow pink green pink yellow

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:00,669
green green green yellow pink what that

00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:02,859
should be is green yellow pink make it

00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:06,459
really really obvious what I was trying

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:08,560
to achieve where the problems were so

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,349
the way you need to work will need to be

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,060
really structured so you need to sort of

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,069
lay out roughly how long you will need

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,489
to do the work in our case I asked for a

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,440
year and then we tried to make that line

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,970
up with some big upcoming events which

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,900
means I got pushed back to about nine

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,310
months in our case it was a major

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,449
software earlier a new version for our

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,449
software and we'd say we're going to

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,729
release new documentation with it so the

00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,440
second thing plan plan plan and I know I

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,870
kind of said that in the last slide but

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,150
I'm saying it again once you have

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,620
engagement you've spoken to people what

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,050
you want and people like your proof of

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,360
concept start hearing positive noises

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,560
from people in power then you can go

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,630
ahead and actually structure your

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,599
project timeline so now I knew I had

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,310
nine months I based our project on the

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,229
high cost five phase model which is a

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,389
really old fashion model now and when I

00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,669
first started tech writing that's what I

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,960
was working off

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,050
so I worked off it because I was

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,749
familiar with it for starters but the

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:10,169
other accepted bonus the other added

00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:11,580
bonus sorry of an accepted model is that

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:14,099
you can encourage people to read the

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,840
book and I've been doing this I've been

00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,060
telling people go to a books you can get

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,800
a secondhand copy really cheap go and

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,270
have a look read what I'm talking about

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,520
even if you just read the first two

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,759
pages of every chapter you will you will

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,680
then understand where I'm coming from

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,120
also even if they don't read the book if

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,719
you've recommended a book for them to

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,800
read it makes it seem totally legit so

00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:36,930
once you have a structure for your

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,879
project set the dates and advertise them

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,770
we put them up on a wiki and I did not

00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,620
stop talking about those damn dates for

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,639
a good few weeks so advertisement make

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,060
sure people know what you're talking

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,430
about

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,340
I also like to make a point of doing at

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,250
least one presentation to the team for

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,400
each phase I'll talk a little bit more

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,499
about that later on but again it's about

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,789
engagement for every phase every time

00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,560
I'm doing something new something

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,539
different I'm starting on a new little

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,159
piece of the project I go and tell

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,409
people about it all the time because

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,939
then they know they might not remember

00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,169
what I was talking about but they'll

00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,029
know that I'm the one who was talking

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,819
about it so they'll be able to come back

00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,740
to me go what was that thing

00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:19,550
so again keeps your project top of mind

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,899
for your team and keeps engagement up

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,149
third research and yes I know we're

00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,270
still in planning I appreciate that this

00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:29,789
is another third phase of planning get

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,129
in contact with your readers in any way

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,349
you can but remember that your readers

00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:38,610
are not always and sometimes not even

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:40,620
mainly your customers depending on your

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,659
product you may find that sales and

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,389
support staff use your docks more than

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:48,719
your customers do and sometimes finding

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,580
that out can be surprising so we did a

00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,080
series of one-on-one interviews with

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,599
sales and support staff and our

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,750
consultants and we sent a seven

00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:00,149
questions survey to a number of internal

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,729
company mailing lists for internal staff

00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,319
to complete but then for our sales and

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:07,020
support staff to go and ask their

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,029
customers to complete we ended up

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,949
getting something just under 30

00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:13,080
responses by memory which was certainly

00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,620
more than I expected since it was only

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,290
out there

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,030
about two weeks and again I didn't

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,500
approach any customers directly I did it

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,040
all indirectly through my sales and

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,960
support teams so it serves a few

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,760
purposes all this research want the

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,979
one-on-one talk with the with the

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,470
consultants and then the the secondary

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,389
stuff with the surveys one it gives us

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,540
direct feedback on our current Docs and

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,220
it also lets a larger group of people

00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,060
know that there is someone who cares

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,729
about these Doc's weeks months years

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,610
later when someone's looking at our

00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:50,190
documentation and going oh this sucks

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,960
they'll go there was a thing on a

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:56,639
mailing list who was that right someone

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,710
cares about these dogs again it's

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,690
outreach and it's engagement someone

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,000
cares about these dogs I'll go back and

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:07,560
I'll find out who that person was and

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,020
I'll ask them a question it's on the

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,479
first point in terms of getting direct

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,800
feedback we had a lot of our suspicions

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,110
confirmed about some of the pain points

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,639
and that's great because we now have

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,060
data to back up the things we wanted to

00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,039
do anyway on the second point in terms

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,380
of a building engagement and that kind

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,889
of thing you might not get any immediate

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,590
advantage but it's that feedback loop

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:32,789
that happens later on all that all that

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,409
you're really doing is saying hello

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,990
someone cares about this thing

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:41,339
please remember that so builds

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,959
engagement in the long term user task

00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,880
analysis is the fourth thing yes I

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,779
appreciate this is the fourth stage of

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,459
planning this is technically part of

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,230
research but I also think it's

00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,690
absolutely important enough to break it

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,420
out to its own point once you've

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,300
completed surveys you can identify three

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,900
to five main reader types along with the

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,060
main probably five to ten tasks that

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,300
they're performing then you can create a

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,470
matrix marking how frequently each user

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,440
consults the documentation to perform

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,959
that task note that what I'm saying is

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,870
how do you how frequently the user

00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,150
consults the documentation to do a task

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,400
we're not asking how frequently the user

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,630
does that task because that's a

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,200
different question so here's an example

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,200
for you

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,090
so this is a slightly fictionalized

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,000
version of my own most recent one so our

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,460
main users are sis admins sales and

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,380
support and our top three tasks we've

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,880
got he obviously this goes much longer a

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,350
top three tasks of product research

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:49,620
planning for installation and managing

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:51,480
clients now we know that sales use our

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,330
documentation to do product research a

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,430
lot okay that's them one of their main

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,440
focuses that they do we know that

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,510
supports sometimes use our Doc's to do

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,710
product research and we know that SS

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,970
admins really don't see admins are much

00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,430
more likely to be trying to manage

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,650
clients using our documentation and so

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,960
we can make these assumptions because

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,000
we've done our research right then what

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,710
we do is we do some simple math we score

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,330
a three for higher to four medium or one

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,120
for low the one with the biggest number

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,470
wins it's not to say that the things

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,630
further down the matrix are not

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,880
important they are and they will still

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,980
be in the documentation but it tells us

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,220
where we need to focus and where we need

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:36,210
to make sure our best work is product

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,740
research scored quite highly so we need

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,150
to make sure we've got lots of concept

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,130
information in there we're talking about

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:44,070
what the thing is not just how it works

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,380
and then by going back and looking what

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,000
we had our existing Doc's we could tell

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,980
we didn't have a lot of concepts we had

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,260
a huge amount of tasks though so

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,660
instantly we've found a gap something

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,720
that we need to work on this is a really

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,310
insightful and useful tool it's also a

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,920
really good thing to show your manager

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,050
to say this is what I'm working on and

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,310
especially if you show sales and support

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,600
people people are actually looking at

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,870
your docks like oh yeah that's right I

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,110
do do that a lot it's a really good

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,970
conversation to see if we're just going

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,560
to do the thing and I've put this all

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,470
into one face because you know what you

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,140
can break this up however you like if it

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,460
makes sense to draft and then do no more

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,590
drafts and more drafts and then do a

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,960
whole bunch of reviewing for months

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,210
months that's fine do what whatever way

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,320
works for you we are breaking the agile

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:38,130
system so be aware that just do whatever

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,750
works within your own processes one of

00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,279
the most important things in this phase

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,610
though however you break it

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,610
is that you need to track your work in

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,949
our case we're moving from long files

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,589
for each chapter you know several

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:55,319
hundreds or even thousands of lines in

00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:58,920
some cases just smaller files for each

00:11:55,319 --> 00:12:01,230
section it's more of a not quite topic

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,970
based if I can use that term we also

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,740
have three people in three different

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,379
time zones working on it

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,209
so just tracking that work is a big

00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,399
exercise to make sure that every file

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:13,470
gets transferred over and split up

00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,379
correctly reorganize it into the right

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,149
place and we're not double handling how

00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,149
you do that and how you track that

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,740
obviously is entirely up to you and

00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:24,240
entirely up to the way you work and the

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,459
way you work best with the rest of your

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,350
team but whatever you choose make sure

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:30,569
you've discussed it ahead of time you

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,519
have a plan in place before you begin

00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:34,050
don't just assume that a spreadsheet

00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,839
will be fine and then have someone else

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,009
go maybe we should automate it um and

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,509
you don't throw u46 in the process and

00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:44,670
yeah also have a plan always have a plan

00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:46,199
in place before you begin there might

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,819
the other most important thing with the

00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:50,730
plan is make sure you've got buy-in for

00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,990
your plan if someone's nodding along and

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,250
going yeah a spreadsheet will be fine

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,720
we'll just track in a spreadsheet a

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,579
Google Doc yeah that'll be great that'll

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,819
be great and then they dump the let's

00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,360
automate it on you then you're in

00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,800
trouble

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,120
because you got to write a whole lot of

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,370
automation that you weren't planning for

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,110
do the automation that's fine but get it

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,550
in ahead of time if you have someone

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,529
come in and late in the plan you can

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,939
push back now sorry we discussed how

00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,600
we're going to do this and you signed

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:19,649
off on it so the final thing is to

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,449
review review review review it's the

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:24,240
second most important thing after all

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:26,189
the planning it doesn't need to be a

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,589
lengthy process and it doesn't even need

00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:30,360
to be a particularly formal process but

00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,399
at some point you do need an airing of

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,209
grievances

00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,500
you've guy who wanted to automate

00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:37,889
everything might want to have a whinge

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,740
about that so my one tip here is to

00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:43,379
ensure you focus on the problem and not

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:47,610
on the people like Maya was mentioning

00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,500
we're using I statements I feel I feel

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,689
this you know because that happened

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,949
whatever things like and don't don't say

00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:54,350
things like Janet wouldn't give me the

00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:56,180
information I needed

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,920
things like i found it difficult to get

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,470
the information I needed keep the names

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,450
out of it that way you get closer to

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,490
identifying the real problem it's not

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,800
about Janet really it's about getting

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,910
the information and you know sometimes

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,850
there's a process that needs to be

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,020
picked up they're not a human being

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,420
obviously human beings can be at fault

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,300
for things do that stuff in private try

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,400
not to do it in your review meeting like

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,160
again I will just refer to Myers talk at

00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,600
this point

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,220
so finally agile this is something else

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,910
this is very clearly not an agile

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,720
process it is in fact a very very dare I

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,750
say it

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,690
Waterfall process please don't let that

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,720
put you off the fact is agile has its

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,330
uses there are some types of processes

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,820
that simply do not fit that model well

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,560
and I mean it's a fact that even many

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,690
software developers I'm sure would agree

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,590
with it's definitely true of

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:58,160
documentation that said if you find you

00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:00,560
can do projects of this type within your

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,750
own particular a jar model you don't

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,280
have any issues with that go right ahead

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,270
knock yourself out please see me

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,920
afterwards and let me know what you see

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,810
prettiest because I'd love to know um

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,010
yeah

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,440
obviously if you can make it work do it

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,360
if you can't don't don't be afraid to

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,980
break that our jaw model and role isn't

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,170
necessarily the be-all and end-all so

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,380
cut the tips for working outside the

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,090
agile model first of all is outreach I

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,660
did say I would talk about our outreach

00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,820
and engagement a lot absolutely do this

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,550
if you are talking to your product owner

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,680
about what you're doing and perhaps more

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,750
importantly why you're doing it like

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,530
this then hopefully you'll be on firm

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:47,840
footing if you can start with your

00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,550
product owner or whoever serves that

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,110
role within your organization and

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,630
whoever is at the top of the food chain

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,970
for you as an individual start with them

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,950
first before you even begin it's the

00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,660
very very first step that way you get a

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,640
heads up you're going to need to make

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,450
some fundamental changes and they will

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,130
factor it into their show join secondly

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,160
track your work

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:12,560
so you will need to track this in some

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,440
way within your agile processes in your

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,800
in your ecosystem if your ecosystem uses

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,410
epochs create an epoch sketch out the

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,740
phases that I mentioned before as as

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,420
tasks or within that epoch and then

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,040
depending on the length of your sprint

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,440
the amount of time you have scheduled

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,900
for each each phase of the project and

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,880
you might even need to have an epoch for

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,070
each phase and then have an epoch of

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,960
epochs it really depends on your own

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,380
agile ecosystem and what works best for

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,670
you be aware though you're not trying to

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,200
track everything that you're doing

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,990
you're not going to be a set this all up

00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,160
as user user stories and take all the

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,390
things off because you're just going to

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,620
end up spending all your time trying to

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,020
track something that doesn't really

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,540
track well within that system all you're

00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,070
really doing here and again this is why

00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,210
the outreach is important all you're

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,040
really doing here saying there's this

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,690
thing that I'm working on it's taking a

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,780
lot of my time and I need to make sure

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,420
you're aware of it so it's sitting there

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,030
in your system as an epic or something

00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,340
similar so it gets looked at and

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,200
approached as you go without the

00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,760
overhead in the burden of trying to

00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,070
actually track it as an agile project

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,480
it's just there for people don't forget

00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:25,700
about you finally keep talking to people

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,920
your outreach to your team should never

00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,110
ever stop if you have a sprint review

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,700
session at the end of every sprint where

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,680
you get a chance to make presentations

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,980
make sure you do one at least one in

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,540
every phase twice if it's a long phase

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,350
or if you've got to getting a lot done

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,820
if you don't have an opportunity to give

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,670
presentations at a sprint review meeting

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,770
great any other opportunity you have to

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,900
talk about what you're doing it could be

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,100
a lunchtime Brown Bag session

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,470
it could be grabbing a slot in a

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,350
planning meeting you could run a regular

00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,590
drop in office hours session something

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,940
like that and if all else fails talk too

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,590
long and stand-ups and eventually

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,490
someone will find a way for you to talk

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,920
about it trust me

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,630
so to conclude I'm absolutely in favor

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,130
of agile development and I will quite

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,840
happily talk to anyone about agile

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,880
documentation for as long as they're

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,010
willing to listen but agile

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,140
documentation is not a one-size-fits-all

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,780
solution especially

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,910
big projects like this for documentation

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,860
don't be afraid to break out of the add

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:35,390
your mold if that's what your project

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:36,170
requires thank you very much thank you

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,810
very much

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:42,430
do we have any questions for LA no and

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:44,660
we have about five minutes left

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,790
you know what to argue with her for a

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,980
while

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,260
oh I'm not arguing and I'm not even

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,300
asking questions but a quick statement

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,600
that was a great product development

00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,090
talk just happens to be a great

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,040
documentation talk but as the product

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,670
person yeah that works

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:07,460
I mean look docks is what I do right

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,620
right I appreciate that there is product

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,870
management product development software

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,520
development these are just different

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,100
labels we put on the same thing

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,690
essentially the actual work underneath

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,900
may be it may be different the nuts and

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,580
bolts level absolutely same process

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:31,310
different different deliverable I like

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:33,880
them my question is related to the

00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,620
content of the documentation

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,930
particularly when you talk about making

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,880
sure that you reach your audience I can

00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,190
imagine that that cool create conflicts

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,800
if the audience are extremely different

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,030
and one of those audiences are really

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,100
really technical the other one is a

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:53,480
little bit more not so technical and

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:58,490
they need do you suggest separating then

00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,080
the documentation into two or again it

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,230
comes down to your own analysis if

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,120
you've discovered that one of your main

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,250
audiences needs something way more

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,810
technical than one other it may even be

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,050
that they don't both need documentation

00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:15,980
one might need videos when one might

00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:17,570
need wiki style every pages page one

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,430
click on the things to drill down or

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,110
more information one might need a series

00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,080
of dot points to remind themselves of

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,300
the different flags on that command it

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,200
really comes down to user analysis task

00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,090
analysis

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,200
find the find the tool find the

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,950
mechanism that's the right thing for

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:43,700
that audience sorry I don't have a

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:45,440
an answer that requires less work yes

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,570
I'm gonna dock right there either I

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,970
think this really does apply to software

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,760
development so there was one thing going

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,890
back to the planning phase you keep kept

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,570
talking about creating engagement

00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,150
getting people to come back to you and

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,990
associating you with with the project

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,240
and kind of one issue that I've had is

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,560
becoming a bottleneck or kind of

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,180
creating burnouts that once you've

00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,950
pitched an idea you're starting to build

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,360
up a feature in people sets and they

00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,410
start to associate you with it they kind

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,510
of start coming to you all the time

00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,510
about what to do about and you kind of

00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:25,330
wonder if you have some having having

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,950
been that bottleneck on several projects

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,750
you know it's funny how often I go to

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,230
conferences and they go oh you're the

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,700
agile Docs lady or you're the

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,730
whatever product that I'm currently

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,910
working on lady um the only thing I

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:43,610
would say is it's okay to say no it's

00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:46,280
important to know who else has expertise

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,680
and also I mean it's probably just a

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,050
general leadership / management thing as

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,030
well is appreciate that other people

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,650
have skills that you don't sometimes

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,320
when people come to you with a question

00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:00,440
the best thing to do is you know what go

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,790
see Jane she's great at that for

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,370
starters that helps with your outreach

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,660
as well because you're sharing sharing

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,280
information and you're bringing other

00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,080
people in especially if they're younger

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,750
or haven't got quite as much experience

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,860
you probably know as well as I do when

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,600
you've been hanging around in a

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,580
particular community for a long time you

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,310
get known in that community and people

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,330
tend to come to you more frequently so

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,550
sometimes being able to lift other

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,650
people up is is a really valuable thing

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,210
and then again it comes down to you're

00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,400
allowed to just sale actually I've got

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,020
far too much on my plate right now how

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,030
about you let someone else have a look

00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,500
at that and if they have any trouble

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:37,400
they can get back to me and ask me some

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:41,090
questions all right I think we can

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,470
further discussion as we exit but I

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,870
would like to thank Lana one more time

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,200
for her talk

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,650
you

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,650
