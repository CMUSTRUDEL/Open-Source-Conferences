A lot of the newer free software projects use either cloud providers or a small set of mirrors located in Europe or the USA to provide access to their software and packages. New Zealand has a unique situation where we have ubiquitous access to fast fibre in urban centres and high latency low bandwidth to International destinations. In order to improve access to popular and new free software projects a number of local sysadmins from different companies formed “The Free Software Mirror Group” (FSMG). 

We will take this opportunity to introduce the community to FSMG and propose the ways we want to help the community in future. This talk will cover what happened in FSMG’s first year of operation, from how we started the project to how we operate the project day to day.

FSMG are currently official mirrors in New Zealand for Debian, Kali, Raspbian, CentOS, Arch Linux, OpenBSD and other projects.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

	00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:09,389
we have two speakers for you your

00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:11,099
information both Brad and James are

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,420
going to talk to us about the free

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,850
software mirror group in New Zealand so

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,430
I'm Brad I work for the University of

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,920
Waikato in New Zealand and for the one

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,960
network Cooke group and this is James

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,359
I'm James I work for a catalyst IT and

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,340
Wellington is Linux is admin and sadly

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,439
Michael couldn't make it to LCA today

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:39,780
but he's the other member of our team

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:42,480
and so a little bit of a history lesson

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,780
to start off with in New Zealand so back

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,730
in 2016 all of our sort of you know app

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,190
mirrors and rpm mirrors that kind of

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,410
thing there's all sort of one service

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,329
and that company that was providing that

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,640
was fantastic for the community and that

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,949
kind of thing but it did mean that when

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,989
their service wasn't running that people

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,899
couldn't get apt updates in New Zealand

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,990
so that was a little bit annoying so

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:09,990
what kind of happened is Michael during

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,549
a particular outage into knee-jerk email

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,470
to the New Zealand network operators

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,680
group and said hey he wants to help me

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,439
start summers and he got a little bit of

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,670
interest apparently this was a sore

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,600
point that a lot of other people have

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,150
been thinking about and so you know the

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,979
hard part is how do you actually turn

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:34,110
all that offers of hardware and help and

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,960
hosting how do you actually convert that

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,790
to some kind of action so that was the

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,070
big sort of first step for our project

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,350
so and if these steps we kind of did

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,869
that helped us early on as we formed a

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,460
small tight team that worked really well

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,880
together and had the same sort of goals

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,950
and we went off trying to build

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,020
something and this whole process of

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,719
building the first version of he assumed

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,640
an FSM G took about a year so it wasn't

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,259
a fast process because we were all we

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,590
all got regular day jobs this was a side

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,939
project but the big thing that sort of

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,729
helped that was all our sponsors who

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,649
came on early and we picked out a couple

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,780
that we really wanted to work with so

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,010
insomnia security their particular

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,890
interest was that

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,989
Kali Linux wasn't being married in New

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,209
Zealand or anywhere really in the

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,190
southern hemisphere so they gave us hard

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,890
drives in exchange for us hosting a car

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,780
we were for them in New Zealand RIANZ

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,819
were fantastic saurians for those who

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,230
don't know is the National Education

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,500
Network in New Zealand for all the

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,660
universities and see our eyes and they

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,580
basically said whatever you need we'll

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,370
be there to help so they're doing all of

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,050
our Rackspace power and they provide us

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,900
free bandwidth international and

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,640
national and limited and that's been

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,980
really great another great thing about

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,989
Ryann's is there a non-commercial

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,330
provider so they don't have incentives

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,420
to limit us they in fact want us to

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,819
provide bits Linux bits to as many

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,610
people as possible so that's been quite

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,850
nice and they're also giving us free IPS

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,950
which is cool Kenna list have given us

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,380
our initial hardware so all of our

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,780
machines are X machines from from

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,360
callused and a particular shout-out to

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,390
our friend Wolfie whose father happened

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,250
to be in Wellington and he put a machine

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,920
in the back of his car drove it to the

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,859
city I live in which is where L

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,989
redundant fighters and that was great

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,660
for a time where we didn't have enough

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,269
money to pay for shipping ourselves so

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,519
at the moment the servers are sort of

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,500
out of support they recycled but and

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,820
there's a slide later on talking about

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:45,269
how we want to fix that so our goals

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,620
were pretty simple so we wanted to

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,030
supply service that was just doing

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,370
mirroring so we don't have anything that

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,890
distracts us from from that goal so we

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,700
don't have a business on the side it's

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,700
purely existing to host Linux ISOs

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,420
because we're a small volunteer team we

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,850
need everything to be redundant and

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,709
resilient so if something fails you know

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,359
we don't stress out about having to fly

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,639
somewhere or drive somewhere to swap out

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,799
drives or machines or that kind of thing

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,569
we have a few days to fix things when

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,400
things go wrong and no one here will

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:21,329
notice because it's all redundant so we

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,039
also wanted to make sure we are

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,860
mirroring things that weren't already in

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,879
New Zealand as well as also helping out

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,189
who are already meringue in New Zealand

00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,860
by becoming and the country code MERS

00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:34,300
for a New Zealand for a bunch of stuff

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,439
we also want to be kind of modern so we

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,689
do be circus and HTTP and you know main

00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,250
goal is to make everyone's F get updates

00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:44,229
quicker and we get pretty good feedback

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:48,099
on Twitter so we must be doing something

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:50,020
at least semi-reasonable alright so what

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,780
exactly did we build so we've got two

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,539
sites to see what data centers this is

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,919
the rianne's network map and they've got

00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:59,229
a backbone of 100 gigabit right

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,750
throughout New Zealand and there are all

00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:03,159
the major internet peering points and

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,500
they have a very open and permissive

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:10,330
peering policy so if anyone wants better

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Linux ISOs good appearing DB and go pair

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,199
with them somewhere we're doing high

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,210
availability with any cost

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:21,190
so apps and sort of any Linux mirrors

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,889
you can there's not much state there so

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,349
what happens is each node advertises the

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,659
same IP in BGP and then that's what we

00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:31,180
publish in DNS so you'll get routed

00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:32,680
depending on where you're closest to one

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,590
of our nodes either in Hamilton or

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,900
Wellington and each node knows how to

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,599
check itself that it's serving content

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,159
and it pulls its BGP advertisement when

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,300
something goes wrong and that means

00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:47,589
you'll always hit another node and so

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,900
here's a little bit of insight into how

00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:54,279
many people use our Murs yes

00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:00,279
very fair request that's why every

00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:02,620
fisherman likes to see you and we like

00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,599
to be quite conscious of privacy so we

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,580
only keep 14 days with a log so I can

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,319
only give you the last 14 well when I

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,490
generated this the other day 14 days

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,930
with the logs and so a lot of those

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,089
requests are the internal health check

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,710
so real requests that we serve to

00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:22,990
clients 3.5 million in two weeks which

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,289
is about seven terabytes and two weeks

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,940
we serve a lot of files our processing

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:31,389
that log took a little while it's a gig

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,000
just in logs and 78,000 unique IPS which

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,589
is quite cool these are the areas were

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,719
servicing at the moment so originally

00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:40,270
the plan was you know improve New

00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,569
Zealand's meringue but while they do the

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,449
most

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:47,740
number of files Australia by far

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:49,629
outweighs everyone in size so we do in a

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,819
month that's right in two weeks three

00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:54,009
point two terabytes to Australia and

00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:55,629
most of that seems to be the callee iso

00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,479
and we're not quite sure why everyone

00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:00,189
needs to download that so much but

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,419
honestly if we wanted to serve about 95

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,349
percent of our requests we would serve

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:06,819
that one file and if something would be

00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:09,610
still show up in the stats in the same

00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:11,529
way and I think the reason why we serve

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,599
so much Carly is we're effectively the

00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,839
only mirrors in the southern hemisphere

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,689
and there's a couple in China and in

00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,389
Europe but they're they're contained in

00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:26,979
their regions they don't get advertised

00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,149
outside of that and so this is a system

00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,309
of mini comp we thought we've talked a

00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:32,619
little bit about challenges that we came

00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:35,439
to and so we actually use Apache for

00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,180
everything and we thought would be cool

00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,699
and would use NPM event which is the

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,679
engine X type thing and Apache and we

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:46,029
thought hey that will probably work

00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:47,529
right we were using Debian Apache which

00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:49,509
was a little bit older and it had this

00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:51,519
fun bug with SSL that would just mean

00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,199
the Apache threads would just all lock

00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,629
up at the same time which was quite

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,849
annoying but luckily was the BGP tool

00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:59,199
that Michael wrote and whenever a node

00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,579
locked up and stopped serving

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,889
it gets pulled from BGP and everyone

00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,360
automatically gets redirected so all we

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,629
get is a Hugh bunch of our arms and our

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,819
phones but actually impact users weren't

00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:11,229
impacted so then we're like oh let's

00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:15,369
just go back to MPN worker I'm sure

00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:17,349
that'll work and then we just keep we're

00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,849
serving a lot of files so by this point

00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:20,529
where the official mer is for Kali and

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:24,639
Debian a bunch of stuff and we were

00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:26,949
doing a lot so we kind of like the 90s

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,059
we thought they were cool and it turns

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,039
out then you had a right web service

00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:32,469
back then so we're now using pre fork

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:37,089
which is pretty much the original worker

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:39,130
thread model from what is it 1999 and we

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:42,699
haven't had really a single issue since

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:46,060
dealing with load and some achievements

00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:48,370
to date so we helped 2° notice a problem

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,410
on there so they were large New Zealand

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,360
ASP for those that don't know we helped

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,280
them notice a problem with some of the

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,100
Accord rollout to some of their Jennifer

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,920
notes and I took them a little while to

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,100
track it down but with the help of FSM

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,080
G's like they could grab ice lows from

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,880
us in different parts of the country

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,590
they use that to track down their v6

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,010
problem and now you can get really fast

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:15,610
v6 through them which is great and I

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,400
think so

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,680
we have also fully automated the mirror

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,150
set up with ansible and our maintenance

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,410
stuff is that which we're hoping to

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,630
release this year we don't think we've

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,000
actually put it up yet and we've also

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,460
released our XO bt p health check stuff

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,490
which is available on github at that URL

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:38,020
which is MIT license so feel free to use

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:40,270
it as you desire how do you use our

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,260
mirrors everything is just mirror dot F

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,880
smg2 oak and Zed is HTTP HTTPS and I

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,610
think available for everything that we

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,220
do we're official mirrors for DB and the

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,950
raspbian ubuntu centers Arch Linux Carly

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,450
and OpenBSD so you're probably already

00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:01,030
using Elmer's if you use one of those

00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:03,010
without realizing it where to now so our

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,410
main goal for 2019 is to get some newer

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,610
server hardware ideally something that

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,650
we can fit more than four hard drives

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:13,300
into and we would like to open source

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,850
the rest of our infrastructure interval

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,030
and allow other mirrors to modernize

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,500
themselves a little bit and keep up to

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:25,870
date with what we're trying to do and

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,339
set standards with so if you want to

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,500
join us if you're not already using our

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:31,060
mirrors please help us if you know

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,250
someone that's willing to sponsor say

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,589
new hardware new hard drives bigger hard

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,110
drives some SSDs fication

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:40,600
you know anything like this please feel

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,740
free to get in touch if you would like

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,900
us tomorrow something that we're not

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,190
already mirroring there's already a few

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,600
things that we aren't officially

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,100
mirroring that aren't on these slides

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,190
that you can go and have a look at on

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,110
the website but let us know there's a

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,450
github issue tracker that's full of

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,370
people's requests so feel free to add

00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,560
jewels there and please feel free to

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,740
join us in the hash FSM J channel on

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,740
freenode

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,140
and thanks again to our sponsors so

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,730
Ryann's who give us the Rackspace and

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,850
connectivity in the two data centers

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,520
spells all of our IP space and some neo

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,140
provided us with all the hard drives

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,310
catalyst provided us with the service

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,520
that we're now trying to replace into

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,350
our DNS hosting Zedeck security gave us

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,140
some more Hardware meta name give us

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,150
domain registrations one give us general

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,800
support and advantage provided us with

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,300
some more RAM so that we could speed up

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,900
requests that we're serving yeah does

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,900
anyone have any questions

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,980
[Laughter]

00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:05,369
first of all thanks for the service guys

00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:08,459
I'm already using it and the question is

00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:11,220
I noticed that there's people sponsoring

00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,139
but what if you want to help up in an

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,100
individual's basis so if I wanted to

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:18,199
give you a hundred bucks or something

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,199
like that is there a way I can do so

00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:24,779
about that but if you yeah pop into the

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:27,419
IRC and have a chat to us we've already

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:30,179
personally put in money so we upgraded

00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,589
all of our recycled hardware using a

00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,629
favorite website eBay

00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:35,160
turns out if you buy Zeon's from a few

00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,989
generations ago you can get some pretty

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,600
decent stuff so that's what we're

00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:42,169
running at the moment and be a pop in

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,169
and have a chat

00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,050
boring why not ex question but um why

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,120
not

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,520
nginx why I go straight to Apache for

00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,550
the main mirror yeah good question you

00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:02,750
can say we're really stubborn a kind of

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,820
makes things a bit easier for us to sing

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,420
Apache so one weird

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,460
so the Marine community really strange

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,230
in a lot of way he's an old school and

00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,810
you actually when you Marissa you are

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,730
sink often in an HDX while that applies

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,000
to their thing and that's kind of the

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,500
only main reason but yeah we thought

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
we'd give ourselves a challenge and see

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,970
if we can make it work as a paper since

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,960
you should be able to and we kind of

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:37,820
have for our current level and to add me

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:39,170
into that licensing because up until

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,470
very recently you couldn't even monitor

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,810
engine X through him without the

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,750
proprietary version anyway question

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:50,870
about the Apache worker set up he said

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,460
you just ran into the limits did you do

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,200
any more than that was there a reason

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,700
why I ended up having to go back to

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,290
event because normally you can up those

00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,050
limits quite a great deal and that's

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,910
usually enough to do everything we went

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,010
through a period of a month where every

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,800
time we had an outage which and it's

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,450
worth got to every day we wouldn't up

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,030
duel those limits and would always hit

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,620
something strange and because you know

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,480
we're doing our day job and then also

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,520
trying to fix it if assume gee we didn't

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,260
always have the best time to debug it so

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,100
occasionally I'd run a stress and that

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,839
was about as deep as we got and

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,630
eventually we just you gave up and went

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,339
full nuclear went pretty fork we have

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,680
enough memory and pre fork is only

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,930
limited by how much memory you have and

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,070
turns out it's quite a small number well

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,770
so you don't have too many clients

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:40,160
sitting around and keep alive or trying

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:43,250
to do pipelining so it's an okay it's

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,310
applicable for our code okay one more

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,310
question

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,330
and you samara we haven't talked to them

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,300
we have talked to other mirrors in New

00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:02,300
Zealand in particular so citylink have

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,730
been running services New Zealand

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,150
forever for Linux murmuring and they

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,130
welcome that there's someone there

00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,900
separate now because they used every

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:15,410
time we are Linux murrow's down so they

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,210
do FTP to NZ Debian and the Ubuntu

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,800
they would get calls to the ISP hard

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,970
disk from randoms that are not their

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,710
customers being like when are you

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,030
flexing your legs mirrors and so they

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,490
enjoyed that they get less phone calls

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,950
now and but no we don't know who runs

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:31,730
you Sumer if you know who was introduced

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:34,430
us and would love to have a chat okay

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:41,590
thank you very much

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:41,590
