Just-in-time learning, the act of learning when you need it rather than spending weeks/months/years on it up front, is part and parcel of modern software development. It's how we make it though the ever-changing industry we're in and how we make use of all the abstraction layers we have. But does it really work for everything?

Drawing on specific stories from my first few years as a software developer, we'll explore some of the underlying assumptions of JIT learning, some notable instances where it falls apart and some ways of addressing those issues.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

take it away as was mentioned I'm Tessa

00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:13,590
just to give you some context for who I

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,920
am and where I come from I am currently

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,680
a web developer I have currently working

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,869
for a Silicon Valley startup ee type

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,330
company I have previously worked in

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,140
government and a start-up in Canberra

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,730
and I did a fair bit of tutoring work at

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,309
the University where I did computer

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,070
science so the fact that I have a

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,530
computer science degree influences my

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,809
opinions on how learning is done oil

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,620
isn't done so you just take that under

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,050
advisement but first up I am currently

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,649
working for bugcrowd they are helping me

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,620
be here so thanks to them if you want to

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,660
know any more about crowd-sourced

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,460
cybersecurity platforms come chat with

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,550
me that is not what this talk is about

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,370
this talk these comments are my own and

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:08,580
opinions are my own but thank you bugger

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:11,909
it so this question in our modern

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,030
software world there is a lot going on

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,549
there's a lot of bits and pieces and

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,860
underlying concepts and if we tried to

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,110
learn all of it up front we would

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,000
probably spend 10 years learning and

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,890
never actually get anywhere and then

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
when we try to actually do something

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,060
with that we'd realize three-quarters of

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,549
it wasn't useful and a whole bunch of

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,900
stuffs changed anyway and we could have

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,290
just googled it in the first place why

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,689
did we spend four years of university so

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,450
all of that comes up in a lot of

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,140
conversations a lot of us are either

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,149
people who did not go through any long

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,829
formal education and have just landed on

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,409
our own or we know people who have done

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:56,369
it that way and to do a fantastic job

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,960
being developers or designers or

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,700
Hardware people that we work with

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,310
whoever it is so when should we learn

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,590
stuff obviously doing it all up front

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,170
isn't really going to work in our

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,430
industry and we have this awesome thing

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,910
called the internet where we can just go

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,390
find information

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,840
so I put JIT on my opening slide without

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,430
a definition of what it stood for

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,950
apologies for that but I was running out

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:31,360
of space just in time originally started

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,710
in manufacturing instead of

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,030
manufacturing large quantities of stuff

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,180
and having to store it in a warehouse

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,490
and hope that you can sell it and having

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,630
to move stuff around all of the time

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:47,330
with all of those costs they what about

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,250
this change in process to learn to

00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,850
manufacture things just in time for

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:56,500
their entire pipeline so the idea is to

00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:59,440
minimize waste to minimize costs upfront

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,630
by doing things just as you need it

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,210
perhaps more relevant to this audience I

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:09,590
first came across the term just in time

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:11,240
for compilers which is a similar thing

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,220
like we compile our stuff when we need

00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,780
it we don't have to compile code that's

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:20,900
never executed that sort of thing I

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,150
heard someone somewhere some time ago

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,400
which I cannot attribute because I don't

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,850
remember mention the phrase just-in-time

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,010
learning and I was like yes I understand

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,660
what that means this is the way I live

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:40,640
my life I'm glad I have a name for this

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:43,490
thing so what is this thing we have a

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,970
normal process normal process for me

00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:50,330
maybe not for you but we'll see you

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,100
write some code something goes wrong you

00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,340
figure out what on earth is going wrong

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,380
you google it or you ask somebody you

00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,840
figure out how to fix it and then you

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:04,550
rinse and repeat hands up if you've ever

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:08,630
done this that's basically everybody

00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:12,020
thank you for the participation but

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,810
sometimes this doesn't work and it's

00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,549
great when it works but sometimes we

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,330
need to remember where it doesn't work

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:22,850
so that we can remember those when

00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,669
talking to each other see them when they

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,910
appear if at all possible and figure out

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:27,910
how to

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,830
document things teach each other and

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:38,330
focus when we're teaching on the things

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,530
that people can't just google so I'm

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,720
gonna have a bit of a look at this

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,199
diagram and look at the bits where it

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:49,340
doesn't quite work the way we hope it

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,069
will and give some examples from my life

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:56,180
which may or may not resonate with

00:04:52,069 --> 00:05:00,289
examples from yours so what happens if

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,880
we never actually hit the problem that

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:05,210
will get us where we want to go what

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,460
happens if we never actually ask the

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,169
question that we need to ask to get to a

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:15,440
particular answer so this happened from

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:17,900
me in the accessibility area I do web

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,830
development but I was not trained in web

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,509
development my first job was not a web

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,860
development shop we built an appliance

00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:30,050
but it had a web interface

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,280
administration thing that was not sort

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,020
of the primary product they were not

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,870
sort of strong web developers in the

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,449
team necessarily I like to code by

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,419
pattern matching and copy-paste I'm like

00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:44,060
I need a checkbox on this page there's a

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,820
checkbox there if I just find all the

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,340
places that say that and put another one

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,880
underneath I should get a second

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,229
checkbox and that was basically how I

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,289
did all of my development that fights

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:59,599
that and Stack Overflow and at worst I'd

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,039
asked my manager but I don't want to bug

00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:03,069
him about everything right like I'm

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,240
gonna look like I'm actually competent

00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:11,360
so that was how I did all my web dev and

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,699
then I got new job I was working for the

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,830
digital transformation agency of the

00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:20,599
government in Australia and they had

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,130
amazing people there who knew what they

00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,789
were doing knew what they were talking

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,780
about knew the best practices and

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:30,440
accessibility was in that thing where

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,509
they're like so color blindness is a

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,919
thing and you shouldn't put your red and

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,990
your green on top of each other with no

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,339
other indication right apart from the

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,470
fact that it looks ugly people can't

00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:43,070
actually see it

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,590
you need to make sure your forms have

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,270
labels to go with your text boxes so

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,270
people know that this is actually the

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:56,390
username field not just it's a text box

00:06:52,270 --> 00:07:00,050
cool so all that stuff

00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:02,590
I learnt there I got to see people using

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,420
the thing that we've built using

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,580
accessibility tools which was amazing

00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,250
and a great privilege there is no

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,710
competition for actually seeing someone

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,120
use a screen reader to make you go oh

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,680
right

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:21,290
I should write better software but I

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,900
would never have come across it unless

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,420
someone had told me I just never asked

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,610
that question I never hit an issue

00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,170
because I could use my site and my boss

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,640
could use my site and most of my

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:36,350
customers that I knew about could use

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:38,870
myself so I never actually got there but

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:42,460
okay sometimes we know there's something

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:48,290
wrong what happens then

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:50,630
we know it's broken but sometimes we

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,770
can't really figure out what we actually

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:57,550
need to go to from there the biggest one

00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:03,580
for this for me has been race conditions

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:07,910
so concurrency is hard I had a fun bug

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:13,160
where our CI system we had automatically

00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:17,960
run our tests in CI and about a couple

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,070
times a day one of them would hang well

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,720
it would timeout

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,910
not necessarily didn't know for sure

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,350
that it was hanging we'd previously had

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,000
resource constraint issues where it

00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,800
actually wasn't hanging so much as just

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,720
took too long but we're getting these

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,450
timeouts and this went for months and

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:38,060
months and we just couldn't like when he

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:42,560
started you Google rails timeouts specs

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,909
and hit enter and you don't it's I

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:50,930
wouldn't recommend it it's not very

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:53,030
helpful whereas because I've actually

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,740
done some of this stuff

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,360
at university and I had some prior

00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,580
training in it I knew we were probably

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,860
deadlocking I knew that the easiest way

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,690
to find that out is to find out what's

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,590
currently being executed at the time

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:12,050
that it hangs so I managed to do some

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,230
very very stupid debugging things that

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,210
involved SSH into the CI server and just

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,090
hoping that nobody in our San Francisco

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,530
office would just delete that server

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,540
overnight because they totally could

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:26,990
they had no like I'm not supposed to be

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:30,860
doing this but we got there we debugged

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:35,510
it eventually turns out rails can

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:39,080
deadlock but without having had prior

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:41,570
knowledge and training in concurrency it

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:47,870
is not intuitive it's very hard to

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:53,990
figure out what's going on so what

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:56,510
happens if okay you figured out you've

00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:01,580
got something wrong you figured out

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:04,750
what's wrong but can you always find the

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:08,000
solution this is the one most people hit

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,530
most often when talking about this what

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,240
happens if you actually can't we assume

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,320
that you can Google for everything and

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,090
in open source you've got a pretty good

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,920
bet of being able to find what you need

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,710
to know if worse comes to worst you just

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,640
go read the source code but sometimes

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,800
we're not in open source sometimes we

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,840
need to interact with proprietary stuff

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,580
and know we're at linux con but this

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:43,160
this happens in the real world I had the

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:46,700
fun of having to write a SSL client

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,800
which did which had client certificates

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:53,660
and such and had to verify server

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,540
certificates and we had to have a

00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:00,230
Windows version and the Windows version

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:03,560
had to use the windows SSL libraries

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,600
which was s channel and the

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,800
documentation if you've ever used the

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,430
windows

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:16,730
documentation for their api's is very

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:19,070
verbose but light on actual details so

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,920
you can spend many hours reading it but

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:29,480
not actually find what you're looking

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:31,400
for which is what I did so we assumed

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,710
that Google is going to be able to give

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,020
us our answers sometimes Google actually

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:43,210
can't give us our answers sometimes

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:45,530
there isn't somebody should just ask and

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:51,170
as you might guess where the question

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:54,380
mark goes next sometimes it can be very

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:58,550
hard to figure out what code you should

00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,590
write after having found your solution

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:06,140
you've googled for it you've got your

00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:07,490
Stack Overflow answer but sometimes you

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,140
don't know how to fix it or sometimes

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:17,540
you don't know if what you're doing is

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:19,910
actually a good idea or not I have a

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,520
computer science degree but I also have

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,700
an actuarial studies degree hands up who

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,770
knows what actuarial studies is that is

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:31,720
more than I was expecting which is to

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:37,580
say not very many it's basically

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:39,770
statistics for insurance I wanted to do

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,030
applied maths and got told do actuarial

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:45,140
studies my okay I don't know what that

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:46,400
is but sure so I have more of a

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:51,070
statistics background than your average

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:54,250
for Emma and a lot of people will

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:58,820
implement things in statistics which are

00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:03,530
close and how do you tell the difference

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:05,050
so the one most recently where I had

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:11,920
this was at bugcrowd

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:15,080
we effectively a bug tracking system for

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,090
security issues there's a whole bunch of

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,160
the spoke stuff there for our business

00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,870
but roughly speaking it's a bug tracker

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,270
and one of the

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:28,820
mystics we wanted to show was how long

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:32,660
it takes until bugs validated and fixed

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,920
and this seems like a useful piece of

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,400
information that people would want to

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,910
know right if you just take the length

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,790
of time until each bug that's been fixed

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,230
takes and you average all of those which

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,020
is what people think when they think

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,620
average time to something is fixed you

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:55,580
will get a number that is lower than the

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,800
actual number because what if you've had

00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,990
10 bugs that are fixed that all took a

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,680
week but you've got one bug that isn't

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:06,529
fixed that's still open after three

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
months your average should probably be

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,950
more than a week correct because you've

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,960
got this three month long one but

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:18,589
because it hasn't been fixed yet you

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:20,920
don't take it into account and so some

00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,420
of these things without more knowledge

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,510
than half an hour of Google is going to

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,040
give you you're not going to know

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:37,400
whether you've solved the problem

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:39,140
correctly and then as I was thinking

00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,670
about this I have my pretty diagram and

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,390
I drew my arrows and I thought and I'm

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,740
like wait a minute

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:50,890
I missed something there's some

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:54,920
assumptions in the whole system that

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:59,120
maybe we need to have another look at as

00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,880
well so this whole system is based on

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,820
the assumption that we should build it

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,890
now and not spend ages and ages learning

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,730
out front that it is worth building it

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:13,190
now that the benefit of getting it done

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:16,670
now outweighs the cost of getting it

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:19,580
wrong and often this is true this is

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:24,020
what agile teaches us we should try it

00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:28,279
now and get more information but and we

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:31,329
can just fix it if it goes wrong but

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:34,750
what do you actually if we get it wrong

00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:38,690
wearing a whole lot of trouble

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:41,060
what if the cost of the mistake is that

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,430
someone now has every credit card number

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,370
that went through your system what if

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:48,740
the cost of making a mistake is someone

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,210
else now has all of all of your

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,000
customers personal identifying

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,900
information what if the cost of a

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,060
mistake is perhaps you happened to be

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:02,750
keeping track you may be a bug tracker

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:06,470
for security vulnerabilities and if you

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,970
make a mistake someone gets access to

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,450
all of your customers security

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:15,470
vulnerabilities the the cost of mistakes

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:21,290
can be higher than we think of when we

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:25,940
first start out and we may not think of

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:31,010
security upfront I can tell you the

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:33,680
first website I wrote had XSS in it it

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,810
was it was written in PHP it was just

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,860
all cross-site security vulnerabilities

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,880
because I am what

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,340
what would those like repeat those

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,180
letters for me again I didn't I had to

00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:54,470
have my boss be like sorry cross-site

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:59,770
scripting is what's Java Script so some

00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:04,940
things we do actually need to remember

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:07,220
so what I started by saying learning

00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,440
everything up front doesn't work I then

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:14,630
said that we need to learn stuff up

00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,730
front my point isn't that everything is

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:21,520
horrible and that we can't make it work

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:24,589
my point is that it isn't all on earth

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:29,510
we don't have to learn everything up

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:31,160
front or scrap all formal training and

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,320
just learn everything on the job and

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,190
only learn what you need to ship this

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:40,490
particular feature we need to think

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,760
critically about which things we need to

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,280
train for and which things we just grew

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,990
awful don't really need to train people

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,880
how to make a background blue

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,279
Google knows how to do that pretty easy

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,770
but we do need to train people and

00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,370
things like security accessibility

00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:02,000
concurrency the stuff that are not

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:04,370
intuitive and that people won't find on

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:12,830
their own at the time that they need it

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:15,169
Oh slide behind but this is my point cuz

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:17,870
let's face it we're all actually going

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:21,770
to work like this the vast majority of

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:24,080
the time and most of the time this is

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,419
the most productive way to do things but

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,320
every now and again we need to step back

00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:35,350
and think and learn something outside

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:49,909
this cycle so that we can build the best

00:18:35,350 --> 00:19:02,000
future that we can thank you awesome do

00:18:49,909 --> 00:19:04,370
we have any questions yes hi there so

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,720
when it comes to learning up front when

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,390
risks if you pick something you've

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,860
decided that is the best option

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,840
what's your views though on is the

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,760
University the best way of learning that

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,590
up front versus the other options out

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,590
there likely online learning tools

00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:28,990
different people work differently I

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:33,440
learn way better face to face than I do

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:36,710
from text or just from even from an

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,470
audio recording so I found a lot of

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:44,529
value in lectures a lot of the people I

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:49,210
studied with would say differently I

00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:52,309
also think the self-directed thing

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,980
there's a lot of data that says lots of

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:57,860
people will sign up for online courses

00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,080
like MOOCs things like that and then not

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,290
even make it to like never watch your

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,810
recording never make it to

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:07,140
first assignment the fact that at

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:10,920
university I am dedicated my time to

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,470
this and there are assignments that I

00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,180
need to actually put in the work to

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,790
learn the things to be able to do the

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,710
assignments like having that direction

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:24,000
from someone outside of me on what I

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:27,030
should learn super valuable whether

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,060
university education as it currently

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:35,730
stands it can certainly be improved but

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:39,770
I think there is a lot of value in

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:42,960
structured education if done well

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,070
whether it is done well is a question

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:54,810
I'm more than happy to have a chat with

00:20:44,070 --> 00:21:01,650
you over coffee probably is a

00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:03,390
continuation of that actually just the

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,050
implication to a certain extent is what

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:11,070
you're saying is that you get an upfront

00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:17,520
learning at university and and then use

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:19,440
that on ongoing but surely during this

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,560
just-in-time part of your career you

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,900
also got to sort of step back and say

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:28,740
now I need another input of more

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:31,020
formalized education you know that sort

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,880
of learning he have fun because you know

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,070
things will go off I mean some of the

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,360
some of the concepts won't but some

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:40,650
there will be new things that come out

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:43,950
that need to be at that higher level I

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,930
mean this conference is that right you

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,250
you go to a talk and someone talks about

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,930
it something I've never thought of that

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:53,190
like that that's exactly what this is

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:54,780
well I've also had been like alright I

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,630
actually need to learn this thing

00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,700
properly for some reason so I'll go off

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,280
and spend like a week or two weeks just

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,170
going and learning Ruby on Rails or

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,180
going and learning JavaScript or going

00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,350
and learning react which was not stuff I

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,060
did at university so there's multiple

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,800
parts to it and they're all a little bit

00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,010
different and they all have value in

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,010
different

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,600
hello I'm just wondering if you've got

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,090
any of your personal techniques that

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,280
you'd like to share for when you are

00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,410
going down your Google rabbit hole of

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,990
trying to fix something and then you're

00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,870
like wait maybe I need to actually take

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,210
a step out of here and justify spending

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,370
a couple of days hanging learning some

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,380
concurrency fundamentals or whatever the

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,820
problem is so I can fix this properly

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,710
instead of just kind of monkey patching

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:57,520
it and having something else break

00:22:47,710 --> 00:23:00,090
further down the line bunch of it is

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:06,460
just practice um

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:08,080
but I will so something is broken if I

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,669
know what to do I just fix it if I don't

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,530
know what to do I google it if I get a

00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:17,010
good answer I just fix it those are the

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:20,200
easy ones the hard ones is how do I go

00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:25,200
how do I know whether I justify the time

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,200
in putting in more effort I think is Oh

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,510
or going yeah cuz on the one hand I

00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:35,559
really like the rabbit hole I thoroughly

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:38,799
enjoy the rabbit hole I still have a job

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:45,250
to do and I still have features to ship

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:48,580
for our uses making ballpark estimates

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,890
of how long it's gonna be how much work

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,580
it's gonna be a very hard but I still

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,590
try trying to figure out the value so

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,059
the one for the deadlock situation where

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:02,650
I spent two days trying to debug this

00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:06,730
thing I had it had been broken for about

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:10,840
four months and I had previously done a

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,580
like half hour go and then didn't get

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,350
anywhere and then a few weeks later I

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,929
did I spent like an hour on it when I

00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,400
had a hole of time and then it was 5:00

00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:20,830
p.m. and I went home and then I bailed

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,990
out and then a couple months later I

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,340
spent a couple more hours on it and then

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,770
realized I wasn't getting anywhere on

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,310
bail that so I think timeboxing is

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:32,470
probably timeboxing based on the value

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:35,350
that I think I'm gonna get for fixing it

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,540
properly the reason I kept coming back

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,670
to it is it kept continuing to break so

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,920
my value judgment when actually the

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:49,000
value of fixing this is going up I

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:50,440
should actually spend more time well I

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,200
just asked the audience a quick question

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,180
how many of you here are effectively

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,120
together yourselves as developers or

00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,680
take that kind of mindset to solve a

00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,800
problem how many of you would probably

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,600
become more from an Operations hands-on

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,910
yes so that's that's not all expose

00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,500
about fifty-fifty cuz you know I've

00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:11,050
worked in both kind of roles over the

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,670
years and so I appreciate where you're

00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,950
coming from there's the the you

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,260
prototyping something you've got to

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,670
solve the problem and sometimes you've

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:25,660
got a sound time box that effort and

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:28,630
we're very good at procrastinating do

00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:32,440
you have any tips on avoiding that

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:37,030
procrastination you turn off IRC and

00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:41,980
ignore your email and what's your thing

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:45,070
I have the benefit of working for a

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:49,570
predominantly San Francisco company so

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:51,490
time zones work in my favor of which the

00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,130
mornings and meetings because time zones

00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,650
overlap and afternoons are very low on

00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,350
communication but I will turn off slack

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,470
notifications and email notifications

00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,240
and I have been known to go into the

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,860
meeting room for two hours when nobody

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,660
can bug me and just like block out stuff

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:16,960
because otherwise I never get enough

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:18,790
momentum yeah and like from a personal

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,270
perspective building and running

00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:24,610
operations seems in in previous roles

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:28,150
when you're fighting the fire and you've

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:31,120
got to do the fix you've got that

00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:33,310
contention because your email inbox is

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,480
going mad and the phone is ringing and

00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:37,690
they're wondering why you haven't fixed

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,910
the problem my advice to anyone here in

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,490
that situation is get yourself a damn

00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,770
good

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:46,110
because they can pick up the phone they

00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,330
can defect the flag they can be between

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,460
you and the other party organization and

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:54,090
if the halfway good a job that means

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,620
that you can hit all the resources that

00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,570
you've got available to try and resolve

00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:01,310
the problem but sometimes you need

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,310
somebody in the way that you can trust

00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,230
not operations person but the closest

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,780
thing to an Operations person in

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:15,330
Australia that we have I have been known

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:17,040
to run communications for the if there's

00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,450
something's gone wrong I'm running

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,660
communications for the person who's

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,640
actually trying to fix it to try and

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,130
separate out the communications part

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,470
from the actual operation spot so I

00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,390
think correct me if I'm wrong but for

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,710
sort of day-to-day life you want your

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,080
manager to be doing that but for like

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,670
everything is on fire moments it can be

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,760
good to have a structured role for comms

00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:41,040
and a role for actually fixing it mister

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,500
chime in on that conversation I think I

00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,360
fear a few of us here have had sort of

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,810
doesn't matter if you're in operations

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,250
or web dev or engineering you've

00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,480
probably been involved in some sort of

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,480
production incident that you have

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:58,140
context to help fix and having five

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,780
people crowd around you not necessarily

00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,910
in a sort of pair or mob programming

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,080
mentality but just trying to like is it

00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,390
fixed yet is it fixed yet and that

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,870
really doesn't help it adds fuel to the

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:12,450
fire so having a yeah having a strong

00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,920
manager kind of protects you or take the

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:18,080
heat in that sort of situation

00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,080
definitely helps yeah

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:29,309
- some comments when you're dealing with

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,500
those fire situations the ones that

00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:33,289
aren't have to be fixed right now if you

00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,380
haven't fixed it in ten minutes

00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:39,270
trusty gut stop walk away do something

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,679
else your brain will think about it when

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,809
you're not actually thinking about it

00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,390
and you'll be sitting on the toilet and

00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:50,429
will pop in your head that's what I need

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:53,309
to do that's where the magic happens the

00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:56,520
other good one is if you're wanting to

00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:58,890
learn something new to set yourself a

00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,720
goal that's really simple like how do I

00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,830
copy or far from here to there and

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,500
you're going to do it with a new

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,900
language do that really simple thing

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,390
instead of how do I populate the file

00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,960
with log data that's in JSON that's

00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:16,470
that's the last step you make it simple

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:23,789
so you can build your experience as a

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:27,270
positive experience like making it

00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:28,740
simple to build a thing or when you're

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,510
learning something building something

00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,280
different there was a talk at the

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:36,120
developers developers mini conf last

00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,679
year on using games to learn new tools

00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,100
because you're building something cool

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,409
and fun while also learning a language

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,510
or a framework or whatever so it can be

00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:48,120
good to try and learn in a slightly

00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:52,440
different context to the application you

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:55,200
need it for office they work just a

00:29:52,440 --> 00:30:00,480
query who in the room actually has a

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:03,390
bachelor qualification ok those with

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,840
their hands up with with your bachelor

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:09,120
qualification who then had a post

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:14,820
qualification verification three to five

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:17,700
years after they got their bachelor so I

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,470
did Bachelor of engineering which means

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,710
that when I go out into the workforce

00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,600
I'm not an engineer I have technical

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,419
understanding I've been exposed to

00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,340
things I'm not an engineer until three

00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:32,010
to five years later when engineers

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,290
Australia puts me on a board I have to

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:37,170
say I have this experience now I know

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:39,780
how the world works I know how to come

00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:43,680
act competently in my field and then I

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:45,540
am an engineer so engineers Australia is

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,390
is essentially the the body that

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:51,810
certifies universities to provide an

00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:54,360
engineering bachelor from there you

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,070
could then go and say I've got okay I've

00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,710
got my technical understanding and then

00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:04,320
I've got my experience I wonder whether

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:09,180
the IT industry now that it is a mature

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:11,130
industry needs some framework other than

00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,050
what is provided by the big companies

00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,030
like if you're in the networking space

00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:17,490
your Cisco qualifications if you're in

00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:20,070
other spaces that qualifications that

00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:41,160
say yes I'm competent at Oracle

00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:43,260
databases or whatever and there's a big

00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,840
issue around certain approaches to

00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:48,540
hiring policies I mean the number of

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,790
github commits you've had is not always

00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,360
a perfect indication of your coding

00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:57,570
skills yeah I'm measuring the quality

00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,570
and yet there is a lot of issues around

00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:02,580
how do you properly recognize someone's

00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,770
experience and there's enough awful lot

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,630
of people who have very very very good

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,810
senior people in the industry who have

00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,820
never got any formal qualifications at

00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:15,180
one point I was inside an organization

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,830
and I define their hiring policy for new

00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,550
team members and realized to put myself

00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,690
out of a job

00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,400
because I didn't have any of the

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:26,280
qualifications required to be member of

00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:28,590
my own team yeah maybe this is time to

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,150
wrap this and we can chat at the

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,770
corridor down the front if people want

00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:35,890
to chat but thanks everybody

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,890
