The XArray has been merged for Linux 4.21.  Initially conceived as a replacement for the Radix Tree, it should also be used as a replacement for the IDR and can be used instead of a doubly-linked list in some circumstances.

Future improvements to the XArray may make this the only data structure we need, replacing linked lists under all circumstances, the rbtree and even hash tables.

Come to this talk and learn how to use the XArray now and how to use it in the future.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
