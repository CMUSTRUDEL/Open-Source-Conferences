Working in the IT industry today is hard, but it is even harder if you are a woman. There is still lots of â€œold school thinking" that women face daily. This talk is a survival guide based on real-life stories and different challenges from women of different ages, cultural backgrounds and roles in the Australian IT industry.
Like any survival guide, this one provides you with the essential information to help you identify and overcome the most frequently encountered hazards. Each chapter contains useful tips, instructions and practical advice on a particular issue so you can implement the skills and techniques even under the most stressful circumstances. From the hiring process to promotions and corporate events, you'll have the tools to survive.
 
You will learn these skills and more:
* Assess your situation and prioritize your needs;
* Surviving techniques for the hiring process;
* Assemble your own custom emergency kit with essentials tools;
* Manage extreme work conditions and overtime;
* Survive corporate parties and drinks;
* Build trust network and create allies; 
* Identify your enemies and their habits.
Preparation is the key. If you are starting your career in IT or navigating through it - this guide is for you.

okay we're going to carry you straight

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,210
on with our next speaker Anna is going

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:19,260
to talk to us and give us a little bit

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:21,300
of a survival guide for woman in IT my

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,300
name is Anna I'm a software engineer at

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,660
real estate at comdata you and today I

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,390
will tell you about women in IT industry

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:33,450
please don't ask me how it's related to

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,360
system in mini-cons but they invited me

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,649
and I'm here first I would like to start

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,899
with some statistics

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,730
I'm sorry New Zealand I have on the

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:47,760
Australian numbers so according to

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,399
Australian Bureau of Statistics women

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,610
account for more than 50% of Australia

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,059
population but only 47 percent of the

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,640
workforce if you drill down into IT

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,870
industry you will find there even less

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,450
diversity only 28% of women but if

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,420
you're gonna look into tech roles there

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,390
it's gonna be under 20 percent which is

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,130
probably very obvious from this room

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,439
here if you look around for me my

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,860
personal journey into IT industry was

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,020
quite challenging I remember in the

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,320
university sometimes I was not taken

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,740
seriously some professors even even

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,290
accuse me of cheating because for them

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,659
maybe it was hard to believe that the

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,110
goal can understand a difficult subject

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,600
like computer networks I remember my

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,899
first job back in Ukraine was in small

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,930
IT company and my boss only hired me

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,170
because he was tired from other guys

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,729
wearing all day and he figured if he

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:59,030
hires a girl they would stop swearing

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:02,070
well did it for the first few months

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,290
when I came in Australia I thought that

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,869
maybe my journey is not an industry

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,140
average and maybe for women in Australia

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:13,390
or New Zealand it's much easier to build

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,900
a career in a team so about a year ago

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,560
I ask as many women as I could possibly

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,240
find to share their stories with me to

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,060
write me about the struggles or

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,760
successful stories and the most story

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,710
started to come the more upset they

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,040
became because almost every single story

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:39,160
had something about harassment

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,290
underpayment or ignorance though you

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,140
might think that situation is improving

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,140
and population of women in a tea

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,740
industry is growing in recent years but

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,530
I believe that we still in dark ages we

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:57,610
are not talking about prosperity yet we

00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,250
are talking about Bible because IT

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,410
industry today is full of threats you

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,870
can be overrun by zombie ops team or

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,810
drown in a fast stream of overtimes

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,450
I think that women needs to be warned

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,980
and trained against common hazards in

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,130
order to survive in this male-dominated

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,120
environment desperate times call for

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,290
desperate measures

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:24,100
that's why I created this manual let's

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,880
start with job search don't give too

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:31,019
much credence to job descriptions

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,690
treated is a wish list if you recognize

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,910
2030 percent of those hieroglyphs you

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:41,200
definitely qualified and you need to

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:44,130
apply in your search endeavors your

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,470
number-one enemy might be a recruiter

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:51,600
his natural habitat is a murky swamp

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,600
between his mobile phone and link event

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,670
he has very nasty habits he can tell you

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,030
all I teach the boys club you look too

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:07,379
young or not senior enough don't listen

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,870
to him apply anyway your second enemy

00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,819
may be yourself

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:15,889
if you think that you're not smart

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:20,639
enough and IT industry is not for you

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:23,370
well I can't help you you should look

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,740
for the job with less requirements and

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,910
lower bar maybe president of United

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:35,340
States you know any fool can get the job

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:38,250
nowadays like any on your first day in

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,610
office your main task is study your

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:46,139
battlefield terrain so create a detailed

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,930
map of the office and premises memorize

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,410
exit locations plan new escape strategy

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,750
and find safety shelters that's normally

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:59,570
bathrooms they can be great panic rooms

00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:03,120
as well blend into you team environment

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:07,530
dress appropriately in very glasses to

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,660
look more thority welcome you team mates

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,979
with sugary snacks and form of cake

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,169
cupcakes or donuts be organized and be

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,510
efficient assemble your everyday

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:23,690
emergency kit that should include items

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:26,430
like spare clothes headphone loudspeaker

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,950
emergency food supply it will be very

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,800
handy during office hours and over times

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:37,169
so keep it at your desk or in your

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:41,610
locker safety in numbers so you need to

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:43,800
build your trust Network start with

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,919
looking for other women in your company

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,669
look at reception desk maybe it finance

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:54,570
department if no women found look for

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:57,990
gay men they can be found anywhere

00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:05,250
if neither phones designers are your

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:08,160
last hope it can be hard to spot allies

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,190
so look for people who are genuinely

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,580
supportive of others people who ask

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,830
questions rather than telling and people

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,160
who notice discrimination and call it

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:23,520
out after finding potential candidates

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,440
recruit them invite them for lunch for

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,440
coffee share with them your health

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,020
snacks and ask for informal mentorship

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:35,090
it's very important to have a regular

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:38,720
ketchups moving on to meetings very

00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:41,780
dangerous environment potential hazards

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,940
ignorance miscommunication and

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,970
undermining of your opinion remember you

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:52,410
emergency kit use loudspeaker if you

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:54,990
want to be heard or ask an older man to

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,880
repeat everything what she's saying if

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,880
you want to contribute to discussion

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,690
corporate parties and drinks as always

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,630
be prepared

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:10,110
find out about venue and activities

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,480
beforehand and dress appropriately have

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,720
a good meal before unless you big fan of

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,650
beer and pizza plan your escape strategy

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,130
have an uber app handy don't post

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,890
anything on social media especially

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:28,440
pictures stay close to trust network

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:31,820
watch out for each other drink within

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:36,930
your limits whatever you do do not dance

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:39,540
never if you feel like you want to

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,660
gossip about your colleagues it's time

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,790
to call the cab it's up for all of us to

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,740
improve survival rates and make sure the

00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,710
population of women energy grows

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,510
steadily that's all that I prepared for

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,000
you for today I'm very keen on your

00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,000
feedback please share it with me in any

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,690
shape or form thank you very much for

00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,690
listening my talk

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,120
we have time for a few questions while

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,819
the next two speakers sit up does anyone

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,819
have any questions for our speaker

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,610
when recruiting how can we encourage

00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:30,009
more females to apply for our job

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,800
positions well first of all start with

00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,140
the Job Description like if you say

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,630
something like I need a ninja

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,579
I need a superhero to come and solve the

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,950
problems like that's never gonna work

00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:43,120
most of women that I noticed when they

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,790
read the Job Description

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,769
if they think that they meet like 90

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,380
percent of those requirements they might

00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,779
not apply for this job so try to keep it

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,209
to minimum put something like you know

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:58,180
we're looking for people who have

00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:59,709
creative thinking or try not to put the

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,470
specific technologies that's not

00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,940
relevant unless for example if your

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,490
whole company is Ruby and you need a

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,680
ruby developer just put their Ruby don't

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,920
put all of the versions and all of the

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,140
like frameworks and like you read this

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,329
like okay you need five years in Ruby

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:20,829
five years in JavaScript five years in

00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:22,600
Scala unlike those people exist even try

00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:25,810
to keep it to a minimum try to use more

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,860
I would say maybe like feminine words to

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:43,360
describe it like communication you know

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:45,070
like interesting creative people my

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,709
question is here can you take the

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:51,149
initiative with recruiters and get them

00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:53,920
to do you have any tips that sort of

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:58,199
push them back onto their heels and sort

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,480
of make them do what you want to do I

00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:03,490
found that in my personal experience

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,250
it's good to give them examples of the

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,250
highly successful women in IT and say

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:12,459
like look those women exist they're here

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:16,390
so if somebody comes to you as a

00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:18,970
recruiter try to not do your like

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,100
old-school thinking of scanning this

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,140
candidate resume and if you don't find

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,560
the specific words that matching your

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,779
description just reject them most of

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,930
things that we found in our company we

00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:34,930
just ask most of the recruiters just to

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,180
file the submissions back to us and we

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,670
do the anonymous submissions

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:43,450
we try to look at the resume and at the

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:46,150
court without any names because we found

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:49,600
in the past that if we have a name of

00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,430
the person in the code submission let's

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,740
say if it's a woman named we found the

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,930
comments are more harsh and the bar is

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,780
much higher so that's why if you do

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:02,730
anonymous submissions it's kind of like

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,730
