You've fallen in love with open source and now you want to volunteer some of your time for a nice project! You've read several guides on how to raise good tickets, how to make good questions, and you feel ready to learn more. But when you attempt to dip your toe in the water and create a pull request, you are bitten but some rather nasty comments which make you question your ability to code. Or maybe you never tried to join a community because you've seen how aggressive they can be. You've heard about bullying and harassment that can happen. In this talk, I'm going to talk about tips and tricks on how to find an open source project that's worth your time and doesn't cost your mental health.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
