You've fallen in love with open source and now you want to volunteer some of your time for a nice project! You've read several guides on how to raise good tickets, how to make good questions, and you feel ready to learn more. But when you attempt to dip your toe in the water and create a pull request, you are bitten but some rather nasty comments which make you question your ability to code. Or maybe you never tried to join a community because you've seen how aggressive they can be. You've heard about bullying and harassment that can happen. In this talk, I'm going to talk about tips and tricks on how to find an open source project that's worth your time and doesn't cost your mental health.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

so please make her feel welcome thanks

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,960
everyone for Tommy can everyone hear me

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:16,070
awesome so I'm going to be talking to

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,420
about how to identifying a good

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,310
inclusive open source community for and

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,570
a bad one so make sure you're in the

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,000
right hook I do live on the other side

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,269
of the pond on the western New Zealand

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,700
Island and that's what it was on the

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,399
email so I love it and I've been doing

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,890
the Bob saying for the last six seven

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,120
years before that I was a Java developer

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,280
and I've been working at balloons here

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,460
for an open-source project called opera

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,710
Maya's as a DevOps work and leadership

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,210
infrastructure and if you want to know

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,039
more about these communities and about

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,230
this project I did a talk last year

00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,359
on Linux convoys so you can check it out

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:04,559
what is it about and when I seven-minute

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,530
this talk my main reason was that hey I

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,640
do remember when I was a I'd just

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,320
graduated I actually heard a lot of bad

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,479
things about some open source

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,960
communities how aggressive they were how

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,729
toxic they were and while I actually was

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,619
really interested in contributing I

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,290
didn't know what a what should be

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,200
looking for and I did not want to go and

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,869
find those dark spots by myself

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,909
and that so many talks about how to give

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,460
your first contributions and how to find

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,600
a ticket and how to find the projects to

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,790
contribute and so many other talks about

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,070
how how to make your community more

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,009
inclusive but I didn't find anything

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,960
in between those things and while I was

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,030
doing the research for this talk I was

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,159
looking for a daughter a lot of data was

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,369
looking for resources and things and I

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,259
couldn't find so I did the second best

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,090
thing that I could do is just ask semi

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,270
random people who the internet what they

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,759
thought and this talk is a lot of

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,300
opinions from myself and for a lot of

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,090
friends that I have and why are they are

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,560
our opinions if you disagree with one or

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,270
two other things it's fine

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,840
you're totally entitled to have your

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,150
wrong opinion as well if you want but

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,470
it's the kind of thing that I think you

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,760
should be aware this is the kind of

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,650
thing as we we've received and this is a

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,599
neck-and-neck total evidence that we

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,080
have but that's all the best that we

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,400
have for now and I think it's quite

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,970
interesting when we talk about open

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,130
source we think a lot of things but it's

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,870
actually in my opinion there are three

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,300
things we call open source that they

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,549
have three distinctive things so first

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,560
is the product or library that you

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,420
actually download so for example you

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,480
download firefox and install on your

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,670
machine the code for this product or

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,670
library is released on the own open

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,950
source library and this product is

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,500
released using the open source

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,360
development process is the process that

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,610
you have the core developers that they

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,870
are the main maintainer of these library

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,819
or two and and anyone air quotes on the

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,830
Internet can possibly create a pull

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,640
request and ask for chains or feature

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:23,040
and everything else the third thing that

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,980
we think when we talk about open source

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
is the community that gathers around the

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,569
product around the development process

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,940
so it's a group of people that will be

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,670
using the open-source development

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,519
process to create an open source product

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,799
know if there are things are independent

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,540
just because you have a product as a

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,609
release under US open source library

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,459
does not mean that it has an open source

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:52,470
community behind it and why there's a

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,239
fair bit of open sources that is

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,880
actually created by companies and people

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,069
being paid to their day job on open

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,500
source there's a lot of people that

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,560
actually volunteer their time to open

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,870
source and there are so many different

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,930
reasons and there is data actually about

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:15,180
why people volunteer the spare times you

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,220
open source and you can I think it's

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,320
particularly important to realize why

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,000
you want to contribute because that is

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:26,800
going to make a difference of which one

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,139
you're going to trust or not and I have

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,389
feeling that when you arrive for the

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,240
first time see github or to get leverage

00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:37,599
a bit pocket the whole thing is

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,060
particularly overwhelming so you have so

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:43,360
many repositories available they are all

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,069
there and it's really hard to know where

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,409
do you start what what are the things

00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:51,280
that you actually find on github

00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:53,500
available for you so I do believe there

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,419
are three types of code that is

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,780
available on github or bitbucket or

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:03,389
whatever choose your poison the first

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:07,479
one is what we call source available

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:10,270
there are tools or libraries that

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,300
someone inside a company decides to make

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:16,840
the code available on github so for

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,879
example there is a developer at Facebook

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,879
and I decide you know manages to

00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,909
convince management to make this this

00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,729
code available and github it's new

00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:30,099
everyone that the core developers are

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,400
all from inside Facebook the roadmap

00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:36,340
happens inside Facebook on the meanings

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,099
on the internal weak from Facebook the

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:42,460
code is available but it's actually

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,380
backed by these companies and when I say

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,259
company I'm saying companies that do not

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:50,560
have open-source at their business model

00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:52,659
so I'm not going it's not a code that is

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,500
actually backed by Red Hat god bless

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,810
them or or hash hope they because those

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,789
companies actually have open source that

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,060
purposes communities on their business

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:06,719
model I'm talking about AWS or Facebook

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,569
or things like that

00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:12,639
what is interesting I'm not saying do

00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:15,099
not contribute by outsourced available

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,680
library at all what I'm saying is that

00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:19,509
keep in mind that you don't really have

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,330
contacts because mostly communication

00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,699
happens internally to the company you

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,520
are not going to be probably able to

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,259
influence much the roadmap chances are

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,800
regardless of how much you can

00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:35,529
contribute in here you have you you've

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,630
be seen as an outsider chances are

00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,510
you're going to be seen as a guess why

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,610
are pretty nice care that helps a lot

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,740
there are very few projects that

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,620
actually pass these files from source

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,100
available to actually become something

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,910
bigger and it's not personal it's just

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,910
the way they are

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,830
the second type and I'm going to guess

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,690
this is a majority of code that we

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,240
haven't get her based on the data that

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:07,420
they have been releasing is what I'm

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,240
going to call one person bad so you have

00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,270
this single developer that had to fix a

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,400
certain thing and they actually created

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,980
is open source to solve the problem and

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,930
actually made it that and this is the

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,300
only person they do on their spare time

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,310
they are probably not being paid at all

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,620
to do that because that's what we've

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,060
learned from the maintainer all the

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,680
conference's that we have around that

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:37,150
and this is extremely common even for

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,100
very popular libraries and tools it's a

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,710
lot more common that you think so and

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,790
that's you you have a lot of examples

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:49,300
from the node and the Java ecosystem

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,250
it's very very common and you have to

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,820
understand that you're talking about one

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,460
single person which means that if there

00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,160
is any problem if the person has any

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,900
single problem on their life if they're

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,230
part of a counter that'll isn't a

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,960
revolution you actually had the

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,540
development is going to be taking a lot

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,070
longer than that and doesn't have their

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,090
own problems and their personal

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:18,400
circumstances and things can change and

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,650
if you're going to actually happen

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,650
volunteer for one of those things it's

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,350
not really a community person you have

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:29,710
to get along with this one or two people

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,210
that maybe the project have and of

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,190
course you're talking about a very

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,260
resource there are very few resources

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,910
you just have probably one developer or

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,510
two developers and that's it they don't

00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:42,220
have a lot of different skills it's

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,410
perceived and it's not really true but

00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,420
it's something should be aware but if

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,090
you have just one person that is let's

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,300
say the dictator of that project they

00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,279
might not handle conflict that well

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,350
compare

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,660
to the committee and things like that so

00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,600
that's something to keep aware how

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:05,009
things are being how that person is

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:08,040
actually handling that the third type

00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:10,769
and this is the one that we actually

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,410
think when we talk about open source are

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:17,879
the ones that actually have a community

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:20,670
around so you have a committee of Corman

00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,249
tina's you have sometimes we have

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:27,569
conference org or summit or something

00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:30,420
you have multiple core developers in a

00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:31,980
lot of satellite developers they are

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,680
creating pull requests and creating

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,259
features and you have usually multiple

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:41,160
companies that might be contributing to

00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:44,519
this this community you're going to read

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,439
in one of the really strong signs in the

00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,170
community is that you have a code of

00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:50,959
conduct so you have more than two people

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,059
so you actually have to establish some

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,100
communication rules and you have

00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:58,470
explicitly communication channels so you

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,259
have forums

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,449
it's like mailing lists and things like

00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:08,339
that when you have two people it's you

00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:11,519
usually don't need that and except for

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:15,029
the source available one both the one

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,949
person band and the communities the good

00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:19,680
thing is that almost everything is

00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,569
public so you can see every information

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,120
that is already there what happened on

00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:28,230
the path and what are they doing and how

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,240
they handle conflict and everything the

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,240
first thing that you always have taxes

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,000
to take a look is that it's a project

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,329
that you can't be part of a tribe that

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,550
is already dead so the full thing that

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:44,339
you have to look tomates

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,199
issues are in diny recent commits are

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,300
there any new issues that people are

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,730
actually answering and actually closing

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,889
do you have requests that were raised

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,809
three years ago and no one actually took

00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,660
a look or decline it or put a comment or

00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:59,879
anything if you have a mainly society

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,709
message if you have you put a message on

00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,389
this black is anyone going to come back

00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,389
to you in one two or three days

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,300
and then if you establish that the

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,899
person is not that it's a those are very

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:18,450
same things you can use to discover how

00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,550
aggressive they are it's a four commit

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,760
because if people are swearing commit to

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,950
son if you if you you can take a local

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,450
Nicias poor requires any communication

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,410
channels the very same way that he did

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:36,450
for to establish if it was that or not

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:39,720
so I usually go for the kill so I try to

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,790
find a body she bad eye means that there

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,709
is there was a user and they don't

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,630
really know how to report things how to

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:47,940
establish the logs didn't really know

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,890
how to answer question it's not an

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,510
aggressive user that came saying that

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,000
everything was terrible someone that

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,370
lizard didn't know how to ask a good

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,520
question and take a look at how people

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:02,399
answered and how they stopped what kind

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,670
of answer they'd have note that no

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,500
answer is different of saying being

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,390
aggressive on your answer no once I

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,860
could just mean that they didn't have

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,050
the time I didn't have the priority to

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,279
actually could answer that can be just a

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:19,980
matter of lack of resources second thing

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,290
is that poori crisis and specifically if

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,589
there is any decline of request that is

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:27,480
in my opinion one source of what could

00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,250
be bad is probably going to show up any

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,610
hair in that because people are asking

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,240
for for for comments on reveal their

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:38,490
code so if there is a protocol because

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,209
it doesn't matter if you know nothing of

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,839
love coding or programming it doesn't

00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:49,649
matter you have to look for the comments

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:52,079
and understand pleased that the maintain

00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:54,450
is do not have any application of

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,430
merging up request you don't really know

00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,560
the context why there was not merge and

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,810
why there was not Montaigne about so the

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,290
cloning of request is not bad is always

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:09,959
about how they handle gracefully that

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:12,810
the decline and this was a sentence of

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:15,600
one colleague and I thought it was great

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:18,810
and you can take it for life if there is

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,730
a main lease is in a trash fire usually

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,260
it's pretty easy to identify when

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,740
things a trash fire and it's

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:29,910
particularly it's not hard to see and I

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:33,180
would highly recommend doing that and a

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,010
lot of times suppose and you have this I

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,490
think this is not fair

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:40,320
there's a lot of that say no we

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,720
are not aggressive

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,230
we are just straightforward we're not

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,750
emotional we are just you know you're

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,550
taking things personally first when

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,959
someone say that I call it it

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,910
straight away someone say they're not

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,760
emotional that is the biggest line that

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,440
you can possibly have but I've learned

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,149
this trick someone told me and I

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,930
couldn't find that talk anymore

00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:06,089
is that can you please rule for someone

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,339
that can for anyone that can understand

00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,860
irony in circles but this is the best

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,410
room that I've ever told so take this

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,220
example imagine disease on on your

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,139
prayer request

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,079
change the invitation for library guide

00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,459
lights can you actually make a can you

00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,550
please and make it nice

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,500
does it sound there Roenick no so yes

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,260
good this is straightforward this is if

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:33,269
it sounds ironic this is not a good sign

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:36,420
this is actually being nasty and this is

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:42,029
an example from a certain project that

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:44,069
I'm not going to make I suppose you

00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:46,170
can't make this not ironic you cannot

00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:49,980
rely this on any possible way keeping

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:52,199
the wards and not making ironic so it's

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,300
an it's it's a trash fire you can you

00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:59,610
can access as you know that's a the

00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:02,459
technical term this is the the feel that

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,980
we actually could get some data on top

00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:09,120
of it that is the presence of code of

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,860
conduct and be enforced so take a look

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,380
on when the code of conduct was

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,420
implemented take a look of how hard it

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,220
is how much backslash there was take a

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,199
look um there was a lot of comments of

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,990
people saying I was absolutely

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,420
yes so that is the kind of thing that is

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,310
quite quite nice you're not going to

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,290
find code of conduct if there is just

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,689
one person there so this is something

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,470
that is particularly important to see on

00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,470
communities

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,300
and why are your accessing y'all though

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,660
things I mean to show some things that I

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,610
believe are plus-ones things so you say

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,080
okay this is a good thing if it's there

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,510
it's a good thing it doesn't mean that

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:53,820
it's perfect but it's we can kind kind

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:56,850
of count some points in here I really

00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,060
think that communities where non-coding

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:03,000
work is valued it's a good committee by

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,570
non-coding ami triaging issues answering

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,940
users and writing the communication that

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,770
is something it doesn't sometimes as the

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,490
competition is absolutely terrible it

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,310
doesn't matter

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,290
is about being recognized I thank you so

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:20,210
much that he spent the time doing this

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,210
documentation that was much needed

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,510
second thing is that this is only

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,930
applicable for product not really for

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:30,000
translate for libraries but I do believe

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:33,420
that products that have two different

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,910
translations for the end users tends to

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:43,440
be better communities than their orders

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:47,010
I also think that when you already a

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,130
community is a really diverse group it

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:53,040
tends to be it's a sign of a better

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,390
community and you have two ways of

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,340
looking that so you take a look on the

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,130
mailing list and see the name of people

00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,650
and see you can gather back either

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,570
cultural background or if it's a big

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,640
enough community that'll be conferences

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,470
and summits you go for the photos that

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,839
is going to give you a really good hint

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,110
or on things this is a press conference

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:18,420
one year ago as you can see it's a very

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:19,890
fun group and why are you accessing the

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,440
community even though issues and

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,740
everything you're going to find a lot of

00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,290
drama mistakes and typos and you have to

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,670
type is often here both thrown in people

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,790
that speak English as a second language

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,440
and native and how do people behave on

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,860
that if it's so can people just

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,320
naturally behave and they actually just

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:43,130
continue like in life like normally that

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,870
is in my opinion a good sign

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,940
this comp came over and over again for

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,690
pretty much almost everyone

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:55,050
if the product if the the community has

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,160
a getting started documentation or even

00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:00,570
the tag saying first issue or newbie or

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,090
boot camp or something like that that

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,650
tends to be a sign of someone that wants

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,840
you on board people and in actually and

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,130
sometimes I'm against admit that the

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,050
committee is a terrible and you cannot

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,120
follow the issues are impossible to

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,370
start but that's about the intention of

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:21,300
the person that was there not really if

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:24,600
they actually did a great job and this

00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,860
is a much smaller session about things

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:33,090
that if you see you should be aware and

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:35,370
and take out a closer look this is a

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,570
pretty controversial one but I'm seeing

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,900
buying for it

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,540
I do believe then when a project is in a

00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,170
cool language Michael today I would say

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:49,230
like gold it tends to attract the kind

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:53,010
of people that tends to be more toxic

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:55,140
than all the products it does not mean

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,380
that every gold projects a bad community

00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,930
absolutely not but take a look closely

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,840
in there because that they have this

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:06,420
tendency cool project high projects and

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,350
cool language tend to attract this kind

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:12,900
of people this is the only red light

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,360
that I have in here and first because

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,120
for count it's awesome and seconds

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,610
because these C's if you if you just

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,950
have to take one thing home is data

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:28,500
slide so I was told by one friend that

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,960
Jax will be everywhere very always going

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,550
to be a jerk wherever you want but I

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,340
believe it's always a matter of Rachel

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:38,760
and the power that each one of those

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,520
those persons yelled so if you have a

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,190
particularly toxic person that is part

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,530
of the Carmel Tennessee if it's part

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,800
isn't someone that has a lot of power

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:52,560
and influence on the community I would

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,679
really ask you to York says if you

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,630
really want to be close that if you have

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,600
some joke that is just yellow the void

00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,130
and

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,559
one is really paying attention you can

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,740
suddenly live with that but someone that

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,710
is actually in a leadership position

00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,370
they should not be doing that the it

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:18,429
effect deeply the community and that is

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:21,400
the return that you say don't and I

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:24,400
think because in open-source we we are

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,490
pretty I like to believe that we are

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,770
pretty friendly mostly we are always

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,080
here to help if you're thinking about

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,990
going to starting on a certain community

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,520
inside volunteer on a certain place ask

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,559

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,809

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:46,720
good or bad about community acts we

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,030
always know someone and know someone

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,740
it's a fact we talk okay there is this

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,620
all network it's an open secret that we

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:58,030
know the good things and where to avoid

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,890
so if you're in question ask we are we

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,320

one you can drop me an email later it's

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,100
fine I'm going so as I as far as said I

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,350
can this is one person that I respect a

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,080
lot and he answered that when I asked

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,840
about communities and that's a thing

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,200
that he had to keep in mind you're a

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:24,130
volunteer you are literally not being

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,770
paid to be on that project so you have

00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,570
to remember what did he join they tried

00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,980
to George's open-source anyway what was

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,409
the reason the very beginning of the

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,419
topic I said why do you want to be here

00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:37,000
is it actually fulfilling what you

00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:40,960
actually wanted to be you can leave

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,059
anytime for any reason it just drop a

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,610
message and say hey turns out I can't

00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,010
finish a tizzy ticket and go you're a

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,710
volunteer when we're part of a community

00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,200
we never when we people who stick around

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,240
we're pretty grateful but it's okay to

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,970
leave no one is going to force you and

00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,490
you should not force him and force

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:06,280
yourself to stay for Mother health is in

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:09,010
danger in here and that is the thing

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,760
that you have to ask is that a good

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,830
version is it really making my life

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,740
but do I feel fulfilling what it

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:20,070
actually started and just like Mary

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,190
Connor if it's not a spark enjoy anymore

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:39,210
