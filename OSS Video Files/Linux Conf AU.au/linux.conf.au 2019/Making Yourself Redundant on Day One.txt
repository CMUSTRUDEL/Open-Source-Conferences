The first few weeks at a new job are hard. There seem to be too many questions and not enough answers, and so much assumed knowledge about the company you joined and the products they make.

I’m going to talk about how you can make those first few weeks your most productive and valuable to your new company. By writing internal documentation that answers all the questions only someone new on the block knows to ask, you can help pave the way for new hires in the future, and even help identify and solve customer pain points.

Drawing from my own experiences working as an intern and support agent among highly technical teams, I will go over deciding what to document based on the level of technical proficiency you would expect the reader to have, how to use tone to convey the company’s spirit and keep a future reader interested, and how to future-proof your internal documentation so it doesn’t stop being updated when you move on.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,820
we'll see how it goes all right we're

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,420
gonna start with a question who here has

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,170
ever started of a new job oh okay a lot

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,389
of you that's good

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,430
well this this this should work for you

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,970
whether you're doing developing

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,160
operations acting you should be able to

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,960
get something from this so it doesn't

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,269
really matter how great you did in your

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,340
interview or how much of an expert you

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,320
are in your field or who you know who

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,390
works at the company when you first

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,219
start off it's pretty horrible you don't

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,260
know what's going on you're gonna be

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,730
looking around at everybody else they

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,280
all know what's going on and you're just

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,980
going to be completely clueless and it

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,350
kind of sucks but this is actually a

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,149
good thing

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,460
hiring new people is one of the great

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,800
opportunities for a workplace because

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,020
the feeling of being lost and not

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,920
knowing what's going on is something

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,030
that you can use when people show you

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,710
how to do something if you document it

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:11,400
you can help them when they hire new

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:13,560
people in the future so first I'll just

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,409
say a little bit about myself I

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,530
currently work as a technical support

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,689
agent for fast mail it's a number of

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,970
jobs that I've had working in technology

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,040
but I actually studied a Bachelor of

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,810
Arts majoring in anthropology and that's

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,369
Betty White in community who is probably

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,970
the most famous anthropologist I could

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,530
think of I have a fair amount of

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,630
practice in trying to pick up

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,509
information really quickly from more

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,939
technical colleagues than me and I have

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,030
a lot of experience in being the person

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,009
in the room who knows the least and in

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,250
most places I've worked documentation

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,250
has been pretty sparse I worked in one

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,149
place where all the documentation was

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,110
stored as uploads on a Facebook group

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:02,590
don't do this

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:04,300
I've worked in other places where they

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,400
don't have much documentation apart from

00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,000
comments in code which is very useful

00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,710
for those of us who don't code and even

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,600
companies that I've worked in that do

00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:18,400
have strong documentation practices can

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,900
overlay on assumes knowledge which also

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,060
doesn't help people when they're just

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,770
starting out and then there's my

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,500
personal favorite which I'd like to show

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,810
you this is perfectly good documentation

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,900
it's stored in a subfolder of a

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,980
subfolder in a shared folder as

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,510
Microsoft Word documents and they're

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,990
labeled only by the dates they were

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,400
created and you may not shock you to

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,910
realize that this was all drastically

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,960
out of date

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,960
[Music]

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,340
so what I'll be talking about I'm going

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,560
to go over why you and your company

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,770
should invest time and documentation in

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,580
your very first weeks I'll go over what

00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,110
you should choose documents and how you

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,900
can document when you're first starting

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,660
and then the steps for after your

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,200
practice how to continue building on the

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:12,880
work you've already put in so why should

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,650
I invest this time because you know the

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,140
right questions to ask when you first

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,519
arrive and everything is new and so

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,320
that's something that might seem easy

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,360
and natural to an employee who has been

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,370
doing the job for two years is going to

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,410
seem alien and impossible to somebody

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,760
who's just starting out the person who's

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:32,800
been there for a couple of years might

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:36,250
not even realize that it's hard in some

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,130
companies there's limited or no

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:45,450
documentation in others they just assume

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:47,650
that you already know so when you do

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,600
when you do write down these questions

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,100
and the answers to these questions you

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,160
can cut down the time spent training

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,430
significantly and that benefits both

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,810
your company and it benefits new hires

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,030
when they come in I actually just

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,540
recently had one of our brand new

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,610
support staff start off searching logs

00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,910
which is really really hard and she

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,130
started that about a month after after

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,819
she started working it took us it took

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,780
us several

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:18,970
to get to that points because we we did

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,600
implement this practice of documenting

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,039
things so documentation you write when

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,560
you saw it it'll go into a key middle of

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,780
knowledge repository it's something that

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
you can use because nobody remembers

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,949
things when they first when they first

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,780
start I suddenly forgot everything that

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,729
I was taught immediately when I started

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,449
writing things down I went back to him

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:42,460
all the time and most importantly apart

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,830
from training internal documentation

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,930
helps foster a personality diverse and

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,759
inclusive team it's a

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,729
non-confrontational way for all team

00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,410
members to access information there are

00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:55,509
team members who might be introverted or

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,460
suffer from anxiety and they can find it

00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,680
really difficult in certain teams to

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,139
access knowledge and that problem just

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,090
gets significantly worse if there's

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,699
issue any issues of clique eNOS among

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,500
senior staff or if staff members are

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,229
just not willing to make the time to

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,120
answer questions we've all heard the

00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:16,090
phrase there are no stupid questions

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,330
but in practice that's not really how

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,430
people act sometimes but documentation

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,900
is always a completely non-judgmental

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:27,280
way for everybody to get up to speed so

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,090
what should you document when you first

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,400
start out you should document anything

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,530
that you find hard about your job or

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,240
about the company if you find something

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,699
difficult there's a chance that there's

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,590
a knowledge gap that you can use you can

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:46,509
remedy it and make life easier for

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,280
somebody who's coming up so when you

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,139
start a new job you should consider what

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,530
kinds of people will get value for the

00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,300
documentation that you're writing most

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,219
of what you're documenting will ideally

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,860
be focused around your own work because

00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:01,389
you're the expert there but you also you

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,300
need to keep in mind who will need to

00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:07,240
access the documentation apart from

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,919
people in your own job description so

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,630
for instance I do technical support

00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,259
right now anybody who's following me

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,150
into my role will need a pretty broad

00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,979
scattergun approach they don't need to

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,630
know how to fix bugs they do need to

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,599
know how to find them and diagnose them

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:26,050
and who to approach when there is a bug

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,020
discovered so you can expect somebody

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,580
like me to be

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,560
quite technically competent although

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:35,449
maybe not as secondly competence as a

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,789
developer and if you have somebody like

00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,740
me who's a support person who needs to

00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:42,770
do anything a highly technical like get

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,419
or the occasional bit of coding it needs

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,229
to be spelled out step by step I

00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:51,530
actually do to get in my job and I have

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:53,120
written about git so most of what your

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,210
write will be aimed at somebody exactly

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,080
like you but anyone anything that you're

00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,569
writing about that's outside your

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,740
immediate Job Description

00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,389
might need to be accessed by somebody

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,580
with less technical ability and that

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,039
includes things like how to book leave

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,509
in your internal company system that's

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,690
something that everybody needs to know

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:13,669
how to do but they might not be able

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:17,389
they might not be able to do it if they

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:20,090
not very practiced with computers so you

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,940
might consider documenting log into the

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,969
portal and make a leave request which

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,340
that might sound fine but if your if

00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:30,020
your portal is quite complicated for

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,719
somebody who does not have much

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,330
experience beyond opening opening their

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:39,949
email then you might need to write some

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:41,330
more concrete instructions so you just

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:48,370
got a new job and you're just starting

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:50,840
out what do you do then you should

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,060
ideally your company will already have a

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,800
wiki or a SharePoint or some sort of

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,409
quick easy way to create and edit

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,229
documentation if you're lucky you'll

00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:02,779
have access to both reading and editing

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:06,110
it and that's that's the perfect place

00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:07,580
to start it's pretty rare to start a new

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,919
job that doesn't have any sort of

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,930
documentation practice although it's a

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,870
little more common that you might not

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,279
have access to editing it so if you

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,979
don't have editing priveleges when you

00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,779
begin just do it anyway do it on your

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,389
own computer do it a note notepad just

00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:27,229
do it somewhere and get it out there

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,909
and that's really important because if

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,370
you just keep thinking I'll do it later

00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:33,459
you are going to end up forgetting the

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,690
tiny points that actually make it work

00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:37,219
it'd be wonderful if you could do it all

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,130
perfectly the first time and have it be

00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,820
accurate and entertaining and get it out

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,640
to the rest of the

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,760
company it's not particularly likely but

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,500
you can always fix it up later and the

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,330
ability to ask good questions and

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,890
identify knowledge gaps that's something

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:56,930
you can't really recreate after you've

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:59,270
been in the job for a couple of years so

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,250
since I work in support one of the

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,320
things I use for documentation is

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,750
actually a lot of saved support tickets

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,760
and this is something I find

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,130
surprisingly useful more useful than you

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,250
might expect because support tickets can

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,170
show you a window into how your how your

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,510
customers are using your product and

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,690
they might find little idiosyncrasies

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,280
that you weren't even aware of so it's

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,140
it's well worth a look through they can

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,870
they can serve as part of your queue

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,700
middle of knowledge repository you can

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,760
even write notes to yourself on slack I

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,070
do this a fair bit sometimes I might

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,840
learn something very useful but I might

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,200
not have time to figure out exactly how

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,470
it works and document it in the wiki so

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,780
for instance command-line tools at fast

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:48,050
mail we use a lot of command line tools

00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:50,030
to search logs and support staff needs

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,950
to do this quite a lot somebody asks

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,040
what happened to my message where to be

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,450
able to find it it can be sometimes

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,700
difficult to understand the syntax

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,680
because it's a highly technical so

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,850
sometimes I have people you know help me

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,860
craft a search for something

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,620
particularly difficult and if I don't

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,510
have time to figure out how it works

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,490
then and there and documents it I'll

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,230
write out the command in a in a slack

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,630
note to myself and then later when I do

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,760
have time I'll run the command again and

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,180
figure out how it works and then

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,350
documents it properly

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,570
so I think that the best thing about

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,400
internal documentation is that it is

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,410
internal and that means you can do it

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,920
really quickly you can worry about

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,550
things like spelling Galatia you can

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,720
also you can have a bit of fun I think

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,910
it can be a great place to welcome

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,340
people to the company it's not

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,640
customer-facing you don't need to worry

00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,290
about every little choice of words so

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,960
you can use writing as a way to welcome

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:51,200
something somebody new I write an awful

00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,090
lot of tutorials which I enjoy I like to

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,810
use metaphors and characters to explain

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,240
more difficult concept

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,800
and that makes it easier for me to write

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,230
and hopefully it makes it easier for

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,350
somebody else to read the first tutorial

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:07,260
I wrote was on log searching and I wrote

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,940
it I wrote a tutorial on how to tell

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,620
from the logs what has happens to an

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,600
email that came in from the point of

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,839
view of Ironman wondering why Captain

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,279
America wasn't sending him any emails

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,900
and that's something you can play around

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,300
with that you wouldn't be able to do for

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,089
any kind of external thing and that

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,310
really that helps make it get concepts

00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,680
clear in my mind's the other kind of

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,390
tutorial I prefer to write is an

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,730
interactive one in which the person

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,940
following the tutorial creates and

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,680
results their own problem so I've been

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,510
talking a lot about searching mail logs

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,720
being a huge part of my job because it

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,310
is I've written a few tutorials that

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,080
involve the reader sending themselves an

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,360
email and then going through how to find

00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,800
that email and the logs

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,550
I find it's really helpful to get

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,170
practical practical contents because

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,050
that accounts for a huge breadth of

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,030
learning styles and I've also retaken

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,950
layer and tutorials quite a few times to

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,600
get a better grasp of things which just

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,370
goes to show that you know this is for

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,540
you too you're not going to remember

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,850
everything the first time you learn it

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,470
so keep in mind that technical tips on

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,589
how to do the core requirements of your

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,330
job only recover one area there's an

00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,950
awful lot of assumed social knowledge in

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,440
a workplace and I think it's really

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,430
important to document that - - to make

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,130
your workplace a more welcoming

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,589
environment so that includes things like

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,600
if when and where these stuff might hang

00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:32,970
out after work if they have a favorite

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,860
pub that goes through on Fridays I think

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,339
it's important to write that down so

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,690
that others are aware and it's I think

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,790
it's just as important to pay attention

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,010
to this when you first arrive as it is

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,560
to ever to pay attention to all the

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:50,660
technical things again your the best

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,660
place to find it when you're brand new

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,480
so future proofing this is the next

00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,010
steps after your first few months you

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,279
already been in the job six months

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,260
you've found your fish now you've got

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,440
all this documentation and it's great

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:11,070
it's not perfect and in

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,940
to be solidified and and made to be

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,740
continually updated after you leave so

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,290
the most essential part of that is I

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,350
believe accessibility so that means

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:26,000
everybody can read it but also everybody

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:28,110
or most people can edit it as well so

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,400
the internal documentation needs to be

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,290
stored somewhere everyone will be able

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,800
to access and that's regardless of

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,900
technical expertise and even edit

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,410
regardless of technical expertise and

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,080
that might require a bit of input by the

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,690
employer but it's it's really important

00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,610
I believe a company neglecting

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,830
accessibility for their internal

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,650
documentation is basically like refusing

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,480
to have a website because the customers

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,900
should just be expected to know your

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,060
product it's very for example the legal

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,360
team might not have had much training

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,340
with computers but they they need to be

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,650
able to make a lot of edits to internal

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,320
documentation for instance policy

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,650
information they need to be able to do

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,200
that without a high level of technical

00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:19,290
expertise so it also needs to be

00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,000
searchable I don't think that's that's

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,190
really that's really important

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,100
preventing knowledge loss is what is

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,050
what documentation is all about big part

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,720
of that is making sure people can access

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,760
things that are written after you and

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,480
everybody else involved has left to the

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,740
company or forgotten about it if someone

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,830
has a question they should be able to

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:45,030
ask a search engine for help search

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:48,000
engines not going to quit and new

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,070
changes to policy or process so the

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,890
longer in your role the more changes

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,020
that there are to that role so you need

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,180
to tell two kinds of people about any

00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,980
kind of policy or product change at your

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,960
workplace and that's your future

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,990
replacements and your colleagues here

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,510
and now so there's a fantastic way to

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,950
start documenting changes that are made

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,960
at your company and that's through

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,820
emailing your employees that's a great

00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,860
place to start but it's a terrible place

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,320
to end because people are going to

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,360
forget and if there's an established

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,160
habit of going to one place for

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,000
knowledge and that place is not updated

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,000
where

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,490
the emails come through then it's gone

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,770
new hires won't have the opportunity to

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,540
learn from this change and documentation

00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:36,240
goes stale so at fast mail we use emails

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,310
through topic box groups to let others

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,020
know about any changes including

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,330
significant changes to the documentation

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:46,080
and that's fantastic for me making

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:48,600
others aware but it's not it's not it's

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,900
not going to it's not going to help

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,610
update the permanent documentation so

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,860
one idea to encourage continuous

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,500
documentation is to establish a company

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,920
policy that if you email the update you

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,620
write the documentation and another idea

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,300
is to have a rotation of people to do it

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,070
for each week it's a new person's

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,110
responsibility to document all newly

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,670
announced changes and that will help

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,310
keep updates coming after you've left

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,320
the company and then there's the

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,050
opposite risk updating the documentation

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,730
without telling others you have done so

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,160
people need to be made aware of changes

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,980
to documentation so that it can become a

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,750
collaborative process so whenever I make

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,880
a significant change to the internal

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,830
documentation I send an email to the

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,560
relevant topic books group about it

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:38,460
and I ask for feedback from two groups

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,380
those who are newer LS familiar with

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,440
what whatever I'm writing about and

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,030
those who are more familiar than me and

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,830
those who are more familiar than me

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:49,920
obviously they can they can read it over

00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,660
and they can they can let me know if

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,940
there's any factual errors or clear up

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,620
clear up anything from that perspective

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,660
but the people who have less experience

00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,820
than me in whatever I'm describing are

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,460
just as important because they can tell

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,829
me if I've made it hard to follow or if

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,170
I've assumed some sort of knowledge and

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:09,240
I think that's a fantastic way to get

00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,910
new people involved in the process and

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,709
make them feel welcome and show their

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:19,310
contributions are valued so quality

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,800
internal documentation it should be

00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:25,230
accessible and that means it's a very

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,660
low technical literacy bar to access the

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,610
documentation and it should be

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,790
accessible by anyone who just uses the

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,380
computer for web browsing and email it

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,360
should be editable also

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,760
by somebody with low technical skill and

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,550
I think also by junior staff members

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,850
they should be able to edit it as well

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,920
it should be searchable because that

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,710
will help find particularly obscure

00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,610
knowledge that nobody in the company has

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,800
any has any current memory of and it

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,140
should be peer-reviewed I've been

00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,970
talking about the how the best person to

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,120
write internal documentation is the new

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:05,280
hire because they can see gaps where

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,620
somebody can't somebody with more

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,750
experience can't but this can all be

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,070
ruined if you if your work is not

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,530
checked by somebody who's been there

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,480
longer because the only thing worse in

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,180
dispensing no information is dispensing

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,340
wrong information and you also need to

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,720
recruit new employees to review your

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:29,040
work needs to be a really strong

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:35,840
practice of ongoing peer review yeah so

00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:39,780
documentation is can be a great way to

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,290
help you help you learn on a steep

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:45,780
learning curve and serve as a memory for

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,270
you when there's no room in your brain

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,470
to store all the new information and it

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,260
cuts down on training time significantly

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:55,890
we've seen that at fast mail it's been

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:59,130
fantastic and helps cut down on the on

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,450
fragmented knowledge so yes thank you

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,140
very much

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,249
[Applause]

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,249
[Music]

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,130
all right well luckily we have about

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,700
five minutes for any questions okay

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:27,790
brilliant

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:30,340
yes I'm just comment to make with your

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,990
future proofing anyone who has

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,910
documentation make sure it's backed up

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,910
and it can be restored

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,410
sorry not a question but one thing I

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,420
didn't a new job I started it I created

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,780
a map of where the meeting rooms are

00:19:52,420 --> 00:20:00,930
sorry a map of the meeting rooms in our

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,930
back yeah

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,640
this is probably more of a cultural

00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,940
thing I've just started as a junior

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,410
asari at a place and and they they did

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,880
the usual spill well you know if you

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,010
find anything wrong on the wiki go and

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,600
update it and it's like okay so I'm

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,790
learning stuff here and hideously

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,140
complex environment and I've made

00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,010
updates and they've immediately gone

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,390
they don't back them out that's wrong so

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:28,300
to the point where I stopped making

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,310
updates to the wiki and I spoke to other

00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,690
engineers there had been recently fresh

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,970
and they've gone through the same

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,670
process so I'm not sure how to

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,230
culturally address that change it's

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,350
quite hard especially when you're

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,240
starting and I think that's um

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:46,030
fortunately I work in a place which is

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,940
really fantastic in terms of in terms of

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:55,810
that I've been very lucky sorry sorry

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:59,470
are you Hari yeah actually yeah it's

00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:01,770
yeah I think that's um there's a part of

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:06,550
it where I feel that you might need some

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:08,620
input from seeing yourself in either in

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,810
terms of senior in terms of management

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,480
or people who've been there for six

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:17,270
years who know everybody and very

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,690
well-liked so I'm not sure how to

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:33,440
how to fix that wait is it a problem

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:35,150
yeah yeah hi um I'm an ex fast mailer

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,910
and I'd be interested in talking to you

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,130
offline about some experiences starting

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,750
there but one of the problems that I've

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,920
had in the past at various companies has

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,840
been like there's a whole lot of

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,450
documentation that you know in wiki

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,830
pages they get out of date and I've

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,720
really started to look at how to like

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:54,010
say okay this is all documentation how

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,930
do we maintain it how do we make time to

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,430
review all of our you know all of our

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,380
documentation and find and clean out the

00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,870
stuff that's you know no longer relevant

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,010
or or updated do you have any any

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,890
information on that in a more generic

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:10,010
sense yeah we've heard that a little bit

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:13,070
that's why I mentioned that one of these

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,750
new support team members is actually two

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,280
of them one of them it's the one who

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,930
told me about it

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,630
they're both searching the logs after

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:25,340
only being here a month it took us many

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:28,610
months we ended up setting aside you

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:33,800
know a couple of hours a day or a week

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:36,410
or whatever to just do one thing because

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,030
as I mentioned I wasn't terribly

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,210
concerned about wording or anything so I

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:43,880
just did it really quickly and I think a

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,070
big a big way to do it quickly is just

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,780
separate out things into categories that

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,150
doesn't even require writing we just

00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,410
copied and pasted a bunch of stuff and

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,660
moved it into a different section

00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,190
because it had been a little bit of oh

00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,750
there's another bit of information I'll

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:02,750
just add that I like that I like that

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:04,100
and then ya became a huge thing so yeah

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,720
I mean even half an hour a week

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,480
honestly I found that made a huge

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,640
difference in terms of in terms of that

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,130
and also getting lots and lots of people

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,740
to do it not just one person I don't

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:19,000
know anything about you know certain

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,890
parts of what other people do operations

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,650
they can they can sort that out and I'll

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:31,910
do other my own area yeah speaking to

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:35,929
that direct problem there sorry

00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:38,900
what things we do at my company is that

00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:41,390
each of the pages has kind of a directly

00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,790
responsible person who it looks after

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,410
that particularly components and their

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,030
name is on the dots and it also has a

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,250
date of when they've last reviewed it

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,950
that's shown on the page that says hey

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,590
this person is the reviewer this is the

00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,240
last time they reviewed it and after it

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,580
gets passed a configurable player to say

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,679
six months or 12 months there's a little

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,929
warning that says this is outdated and

00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,210
automatically submits a bug against them

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:06,799
to go and review it and check that it's

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,540
all up to date and all that is is they

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,179
just go and increment the date as like

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:15,460
yep they're still good and it kind of

00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:15,460
avoids that sort of documentation rots

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,049
yeah we don't we don't have that at the

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:30,500
moment but that's it that's a that's a

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:32,630
really fantastic idea yeah reading some

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,450
maths books recently oh the thing that

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,840
helped me the most was the glossary so

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:42,350
if you use a Jag and glossary oh yeah

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,720
it's a common thing and then you can use

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:48,110
the jargon freely because there's a

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,919
glossary the Tulsa detail yeah I've had

00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:55,580
a little bit I came across certain email

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,010
codes for in flags of what happens to an

00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,260
email yeah the next total sense when you

00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,910
know what they mean but you got you

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,100
gotta first learn what they mean so I'm

00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:09,340
I have tried to try to pay attention to

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,340
