Stephen joined the Wordfence Site Cleaning team part-time at the start of 2017, having virtually no experience with WordPress, Wordfence, or cleaning infected websites. His only real credentials were a love of PHP development, a keen interest in security, and the crazy idea that cleaning infected sites would be fun. Fast-forward to the end of 2018, Stephen has stepped back from site cleaning and has joined the Wordfence team full time as a developer, so now it's time for him to tell his story. In this talk he will share stories from the more memorable sites he cleaned (names changed to protect the innocent), including revealing his all-time favorite WP malware, and the epic tale of the persistent attacker that almost thwarted the Wordfence team completely. Scattered throughout will be tips and ideas to help protect your site from compromise and keep everyone (except the bad guys!) happy.

Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
