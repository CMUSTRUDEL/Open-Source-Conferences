Technical writing and user testing may seem like two compltetly different fields, but they actually intersect more often than not. If you think about it, they both share the same purpose of ensuring that the UX is smooth and streamlined.

When in the position of writing documentation, we are always told about the issues that users face on a daily basis. But what if we tumbled down the rabbithole and into the world of user testing, and actually witnessed the users issue first hand? 

In this talk I want to discuss the many benefits of intersecting user testing with technical documentation. I will share my experiences of writing documnetation and conducting user testing, while also going over several skills and techniques that can be used to convert the results from user testing into better documentation.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

please make him feel welcome thank you

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,809
very much introduction hi everybody

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,910
thank you very much for coming along

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,299
today and thank you anyone who is

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:20,820
watching in remotely as well my name is

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:22,590
Fraser I here for you from Melbourne

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,460
Australia I work for a company called

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,730
fast meal and today I wanted to talk to

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,619
you about how user testing Kidon give

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,340
technical writers better perspective

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,870
when writing documentation so I'll give

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,140
you a bit of background about and who I

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,059
am so I'm originally from Glasgow

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,350
Scotland you can tell by the obvious I

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:49,890
sent I studied marketing and business

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,440
law I've then went working to your

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,960
various jobs relating to customer

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,469
service the administration I moved to

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,730
Melbourne about 18 months ago and

00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:04,790
started working in a you know technical

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:08,010
support documentation with fast meal and

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:12,150
they've been so kind recently to let me

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,610
dabble in user testing and I'm very

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,930
happy today to share with you why I

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:22,409
believe I can give you know you better

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,080
perspective and rating documentation so

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,229
let's start with technical writing what

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,590
is the the main process of it well what

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,920
we generally want to do we want to give

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,170
our users or customers complex

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,590
information and a format that can be

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,759
understood and it's also engaging as

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,590
well you there really is no you know

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,840
rhyme or reason to write documentation

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,290
if it's going to go over your your

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,189
target audiences head they need to it

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,189
needs to be understood

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,200
I'll pose a question to the audience

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,820
here generally what what do you do when

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,090
you interact with anything you so say

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:10,229
you have a new smartphone or you use a

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,610
new email provider imagine most of you

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,590
just you know you

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,260
you test for yourselves you don't

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,630
necessarily go with the exception of

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,730
IKEA furniture and I had this issue last

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,410
weekend where I had to read the

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,910
instruction from the start but generally

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,830
with most other things you think hey

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,420
I've got this new thing I want to test

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,960
out and see what I can do can I do this

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,660
can I do that and for the most part

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:40,060
that's the same for technical writers as

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:44,650
well when we start a new position and we

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,270
get to grips with the product we we

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,780
don't immediately go to the help pages

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:54,040
we want to see what the product can do

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,720
and generally when any new help

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,020
documentation is written it's written

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,240
based on the ten who writers experience

00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,750
of it coming from the viewpoint of well

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,240
I did this and it produced this so this

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,410
is how this is how any customers or

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,480
users can solve the issue obviously

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,970
there's more than one solution to a

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,440
problem but when you're constructing the

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,630
narrative of the help page

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:22,120
what takes precedent is this is how I

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:24,670
did it so as a technical writer it's

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,700
very important to think about your

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,570
customer you you really need to to bear

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:34,030
in mind when writing the documentation

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,230
that when like a user or customer is

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,630
looking at the help documentation

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,110
they're not coming at it from know I

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,269
come in clear mindset you know something

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,820
that they're expecting to work as I'm

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:48,190
working and you know they're they're

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,019
desperately searching for answers and if

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,209
they're reading over the help page and

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:56,769
it's not making sense or if they can't

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:58,690
simply find what as there any documents

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,940
relating to the issue they're going to

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,709
get more and more frustrated with and

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,500
more agitated with each unsuccessful

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:15,610
click so what what can we do to improve

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:18,130
the users experience well how can

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,700
technical writing helping technical

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:24,160
writers benefit from user testing well

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,169
it can be used for evaluation purposes

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,999
first and foremost so

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,030
you already have your help documentation

00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:32,740
you want to make sure that that help

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,370
documentation makes sense first and

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,199
foremost at all and this is step one so

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,330
you've you've careful that you know what

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,849
you know what issues users are having

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,999
based on what you've been told you're

00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:48,400
triple-checked the the steps and now you

00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:50,499
want to to test them for real so you may

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,560
want to ask a colleague in a different

00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:55,180
Department hey can you try this out and

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,509
beat this and does this make any sense

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,789
to you and if you can go from there as

00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:04,840
to whether or not your help page needs

00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:06,009
any be working as technical writers as

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,430
well but we know the longer we were

00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:11,889
ingrained within you know before the

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,250
organization we're working for we become

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:19,210
far too familiar with the product or the

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,919
system that we use and you you know the

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,039
longer you work in the ER you forget and

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,839
you will say of that initial first

00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:30,339
feeling of what it is like you go all

00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:33,339
that this is over here and you know just

00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:34,870
general functionalities as well and user

00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,810
testing is very useful from the fact

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,710
that if you know you can sit and see

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,979
somebody go through their first

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,270
experience with a product you know

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:48,339
that's what you really need to be a

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,199
really restorative perspective and where

00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:53,439
that's we need to be focused on when

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,750
rating help documentation you know an

00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,699
example I always keep in mind in terms

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,680
of first interactions with something

00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:03,520
news the first time I ever used an

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,589
iPhone um I had got horrendous history

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,909
of like terrible phones I started out

00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,729
with like the the brick falling like the

00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:13,659
Nokia 3310 and gradually worked my way

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:15,759
up and sort of ten years ago no frost

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:18,490
had that I fall in and say how do i

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,409
unlock my phone how do I go to my text

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,719
messages I hope that share my email and

00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:25,389
just that general

00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:29,139
Canobie wildermann and as tingles on you

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:31,180
become more used to the product so I

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,180
keep that I always keep that in mind

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,599
when writing documentation because

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,770
primarily if users are having an issue

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,990
and they've newly

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,180
you know signed up to your product to

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,900
have newly bought your product there

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,460
won't be terribly familiar with it so I

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,650
want to introduce you to my good friend

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:57,949
Morpheus more efficient I we go way back

00:06:51,650 --> 00:07:00,530
just I'm hopefully a few people here are

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:03,620
familiar with the film The Matrix so as

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,250
ten operators more and more fuses giving

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,139
us an option

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,300
you know we we could see the blue pill

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,490
very easily you know we can wake up and

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,169
I bear the next day and pretend nothing

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,909
ever happened our documentation doesn't

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:17,599
need evaluation doesn't even proving

00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:19,340
it's fine the way as or we could take

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,370
the red pill we could do some user

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:28,099
testing and we can see just how far the

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:32,210
rabbit hole goes so what does user

00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:35,960
testing usually entail well from my

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:40,490
experience observation as a big factor

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,470
so as I touched on earlier as technical

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,669
writers or if you're working in support

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:49,580
you're constantly you're constantly told

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:52,580
issues that your customers in your users

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,310
are experiencing but what if you could

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,880
actually witness firsthand that if you

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,110
could see somebody if you're sitting in

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,780
the room of somebody and you're seeing

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,400
them struggle it can give you a whole

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:11,780
brand new and say when you're developing

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:14,900
new help documentation so how do we go

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,659
about user testing well there are a

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,479
variety of research methods and

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:24,080
techniques the one I found to be most

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:27,919
prominent as a contextual inquiry now a

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,319
contextual inquiry as a combination of a

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,870
contextual interview and observation

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,899
technique so what you're what you're

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:39,890
essentially doing you are giving the

00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:44,140
user a task to perform while also asking

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:48,140
questions as they perform these tasks

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,270
the data in relation to the user

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,100
performing these tasks and also the

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,390
questions you're asking this data can be

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,360
recorded through

00:08:53,390 --> 00:09:00,470
you know audio and video recording as

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:05,480
well once we've done that we want to

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:08,630
construct a user testing script so when

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,130
you're writing the script you have to

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,500
keep in mind you want to you want to

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,390
unleash your inner talk-show host to be

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,300
it you know Jimmy Fallon or Graham

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,890
Norton you just keep that might keep

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,860
that mindset that you you know you're

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,140
here to host the user make them feel as

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,570
comfortable as possible and get them to

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,660
talk about your product to construct

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,310
this user testing script you will need

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,709
to collaborate with your support team

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:37,390
you know your support team is at the

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:40,880
coalface every day they know the

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,070
customers issues and that of us all as a

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,060
great starting point to to focus in on

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:49,670
the pinpoints we also we want to you

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,970
know keep the script open-ended so when

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,170
I say all open-ended you know an example

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,209
could be like what do you expect to

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,589
happen when you click this or what do

00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:59,570
you expect to happen when you press that

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:03,110
you know we thought we would want to

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:05,720
limit it to yes or no you know questions

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,180
because it kind of limits the the data

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,040
we'll get back and we also don't want to

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,980
use words within the user interface as

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,079
well now the reason we don't use the

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,790
words within the user interface is it

00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:19,820
has the potential of skewing the data

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:22,010
and potentially leading the user or the

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,170
customer down a path that they might

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,350
Nestle have not have gone down on if

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:31,730
they weren't familiar with the UI so if

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:36,529
you have like if a user a customer is

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,940
looking for a chat a chat bot and you

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:41,029
know it's got a flashing tab in the

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,320
corner saying assist me like and the

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,209
users aren't able to find that and

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,680
you've given the task of finding the

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:50,029
chat bot and and you see something like

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,320
if they say to you oh I can't find the

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:52,880
chat bot and used to restate to user

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,260
well where do you think you can find

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,730
assistance with that and then they go

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,990
all this thing that says assist in the

00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,720
bottom right hand corner I'll click on

00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,149
that so we generally do want to do that

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,980
as a sec is it all leads the customer

00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,339
down up half that the mainus I've gone

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,339
down on

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:13,620
so slightly participants who did say it

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,770
gets to do user testing well you can do

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,460
this a variety of manners

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:23,100
you can select participate you can start

00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,540
internally not necessarily with khaalis

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,490
because you know they'll be familiar

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,680
with you know your your products or

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,980
software but they might know like a

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,020
family member or a friend that isn't

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,020
familiar and it would be easier to set

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,630
up a time to conduct the user testing

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:44,310
session you can also be show externally

00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,750
as well but generally to attract you

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,760
know external members of the public

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:54,690
you'd have to you know offer an

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:56,850
incentive like a gift card or cash know

00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:02,840
what we next want to do we want to

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:06,780
create the ideal testing environment so

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:10,410
ideally we're using the contextual

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:12,390
inquiry we want that you want to have a

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,660
technical writer in one room with the

00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:19,400
user and in another room you want to

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:23,040
have a colleague or several colleagues

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,820
and another the reason for this in the

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,610
testing environment will have the users

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,460
actions and monitored as well as what

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,470
they're seeing the reason about the bet

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,930
reason why this is a spice office all

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:40,440
your callers can assist you being in

00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:44,220
that situation several times it can be

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,940
very hard to run the user testing

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,150
session in terms of asking questions

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,890
taking notes checking the time

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,860
monitoring what the user is doing it is

00:12:52,890 --> 00:13:00,030
very hard now on impossible to do all

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,700
that at the same time you need to bear

00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,280
in mind as well if you're testing users

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,140
that are new to your product or software

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,080
they're receiving a lot of new

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:14,040
information data very fastest it's very

00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,140
much ok it could be quite intimidating

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,570
you know being given tasks to perform

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,670
being asked questions so you don't want

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,480
your testing session to go on

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:30,140
long I've found any more than half an

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:33,060
hour the the tester could potentially

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,620
not not switched off but you you the the

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,760
feedback you'll get what won't be as

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,820
prominent as you would be getting

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,730
earlier on in the testing session in

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:45,660
terms of the amount of participants she

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:48,180
needs there's been a usability testing

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,790
studies show that you only need five

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,390
participants five processor five

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:58,530
participants can show up to 80% of

00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:01,850
you're giving up products issues and

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:07,770
problems there was a study conducted by

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:11,070
the Nelson Norman group this is quite an

00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:13,320
old study it was probably 18 19 years

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,580
old but it's still quite relevant if in

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:21,000
a user testing today and they found that

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:23,910
if you capture user testing simple a lot

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,830
of organizations in the past the user

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,560
testing was quite convoluted and

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,590
expansive and you would have testing

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,830
sessions brought on for a long time

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,570
everybody

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,030
they wouldn't really the issues would

00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,550
relate so if you keep your testing

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,470
focused and small and use a small amount

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,030
of participants

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:50,580
you'll get greater feedback in the long

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:53,270
run now this is very key when running a

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,100
user testing session so you know we're

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:59,430
know as a technical writer or if you're

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,010
working in support or just as a human

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,800
being you know you if you see somebody

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:10,280
struggling if you see something neat you

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:13,490
want to help them and there will be

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,400
you'll be very surprised that where your

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,540
your user both check up on when

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,830
conducting the task that you've given to

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:26,490
them and you really you must fight the

00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:30,180
urge to leap them on or to to give them

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,660
a hint because it could they can secure

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,200
the data so you'll be aware of a few

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,510
paper

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:41,010
that the user will come across because

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,959
you've already collaborated with your

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,279
support team a little bit other ones

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,440
that will come as a complete surprise

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,170
you'll want to stop the testing session

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,910
right there run back to your desk hop

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,100
onto your desktop and start changing

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,750
some help pages but you can't do that

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,160
because this is only the first testing

00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:02,730
session we're on we've got still got a

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:06,300
few more to go through so once we have

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:11,040
conducted our user testing sessions we

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:14,010
need to plan our analysis early on so as

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,660
you go through your user testing session

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:21,750
we need to organize and digest the

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,610
results you can apply some affinity

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,260
diagramming methods as well for those of

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,230
you who don't know what affinity

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,480
diagramming is it's um as useful a

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:34,620
regular within the field of user

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,209
research basically any feedback given

00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,010
from testing sessions or put into groups

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:42,329
in terms of how they relate to one

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:45,110
another so like an example that we had

00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:51,089
recently when we ran one of our sessions

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:55,620
was users were having issues with our

00:16:51,089 --> 00:17:00,300
billing page in terms of how to renew or

00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:03,060
how to add or the preferred credit card

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,919
so if we had an affinity that diagram it

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,589
would come under billing then things

00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,020
such as you know adding a credit card or

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,640
renewing your account with really very

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:17,610
closer together because it all falls

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:22,309
onto billing so now we've done our

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:25,650
analysis we can extract some insights so

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,720
Rita think back to you know what was the

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,390
original purpose of conducting you know

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,280
user testing and that comes back to the

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,250
core of water is to be a technical

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,570
writer we want to we want to help we

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,480
want to help our users we want to help

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:42,750
our customers and by doing so we need to

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,049
give them complex information that they

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,550
can be understand be understood and if

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,200
you know using

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,900
user testing as a terms of evaluation

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,430
and in going forward that's certainly

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,580
the way in which we can improve our help

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,100
documentation we can also extract some

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:03,990
insights using storyboards or experience

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,850
Maps so when I say storyboards it you

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,040
know as the name is what it says on the

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,140
ten it could you

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,780
we have a conference room back at the

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,450
office in you know the walls probably

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,290
led just up to the penguin to the corner

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,970
wall there and it's just full of you

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,570
know from what what is it like when the

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:27,180
user wakes up in the morning and how

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,460
they go about their day any issues they

00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,000
might come across to say hey I want to I

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:38,610
want to create a real for my mailbox and

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,920
the sites they say men receive a Emil

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,260
and their inbox and but they don't know

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,910
where rooms necessarily live so they go

00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:52,200
to the help page and you get the idea so

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:56,370
now that we have extracted some insights

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,720
from our analysis what can we do how can

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,660
we take what we've learned from user

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,820
session today and you know apply and

00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:09,810
apply it in the future

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:11,580
what and to do that what I'll see is an

00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,530
example I used by the very first time I

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,260
read user testing so before I did user

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:21,030
testing either slowly worked in support

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:23,970
so they worked in documentation so when

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:26,460
I was a woman that came in lovely woman

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:30,360
and we went over the user testing script

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:36,570
and it was innocent in the scenario it

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:38,460
was like configuring your I just get

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,760
give away the story that actually ever

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,760
setting up yeah her iPhone with a fast

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,160
meal and within the help documentation

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,570
and I use this a lot and I just said

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,630
that there I see could actually

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:55,860
configure a lot and I've been told off

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:57,450
for out before it's and as soon as this

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,180
woman seen configure she went oh

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,010
configure and and it just didn't pray

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,290
she got from it was that it was a

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,900
relatively simple relatively simple

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,970
thing to set up but I made it sound

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,260
harder by using the words configure

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:17,290
rather than you can easily set up and I

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:19,030
always I've to dust freshmen I'm ain't

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,560
enough to take that forward no so when I

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,020
write my help documentation

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,560
I basically configure I just like no

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:31,060
it's a cut that Oh delete set off and

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,590
make it easier for I try not you know

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,970
users to feel so intimidated when

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:38,850
looking at the help documentation so

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:42,880
going forward

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:46,000
bear in mind tech writers are you know

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,860
we're on the side of the user and user

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,870
we're finding the grand scheme of things

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:54,910
within the organization users the users

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,680
don't have the biggest voice so it's

00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,840
very important for technical writers is

00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:04,510
very important for support to voice your

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:08,380
concerns the even to you colleagues in

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:11,530
the development department if if you see

00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:14,440
an issue and you go you go to a

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:16,300
developer and say I need to say I'm

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,580
sorry to say but we're getting repeated

00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,760
issues with us I have data to back up I

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,950
have user testing too and I have a video

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,140
I have an audio recording to show the

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,340
five people are struggling with this

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,170
potential part maybe we need to rethink

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,830
this or how can we make this easier for

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:36,600
our users keep your users at the

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:40,390
forefront of your mind when writing new

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,840
documentation as well while integrating

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:46,420
user testing I mean I thought the first

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,090
testing session I ran was a good six

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,360
months ago but actually still picture

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,830
clear in my mind because they're not

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,650
they're not users to me though they're

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,020
not the they're not just names in an

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,850
email that these are people you know

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,530
with real-life problems just trying to

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,680
go about their day with this you know

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,000
with no hassle and you you want to make

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,010
things easier all you want you want them

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,810
to like your products so you need to

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,420
keep your users at the forefront of your

00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,700
mind and also the main purpose as I said

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,410
for you

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,800
integrating user testing of technical

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,600
writing is evaluation documentation

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,890
doesn't have a long lifespan you know it

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,220
gets dated very quickly and because your

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,960
product is constantly changing so as

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,670
your product constantly changes your

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,640
documentation is to constantly change as

00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:37,940
well and what better way to to keep up

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,660
your high standard documentation line

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:44,190
evaluating using user testing that is

00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,470
everything I wanted to speak to you

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,900
about today everybody thank you very

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,550
much for your time if you have any

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:59,850
questions it's all I'll be more happy to

00:22:50,550 --> 00:23:01,740
answer them thank you very much we have

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:09,000
about three minutes for questions if

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:10,560
anyone has one thank you very much those

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,900
user tests you're describing they sound

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,700
very similar and it's not unintentional

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,440
obviously to what user experience people

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,200
do when they're evaluating their product

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,720
do you see any differences in the types

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,520
of user scripts that you provide for

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,960
your documentation test so this is a

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,700
user experience or could you use the

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,440
same test for teams of people you could

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,580
probably use the same in some scenarios

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,520
I would say the the skeleton of it is

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,440
most most of the same but the maybe

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,810
element you may have to swap in in here

00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,120
and then the follow-on question is how

00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,730
often do you look at an issue that a

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,130
user faces and say oh that's such a

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,840
glaring error that they've made that it

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,200
we don't we shouldn't document it we

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,510
could get someone to fix the product to

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,570
document a good question we don't

00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:03,870
necessarily have a set policy for that

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:06,420
but if it was up to me I would say you

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,450
know every three to six months I think

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:12,090
it's a good a good policy I've obviously

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,290
that's my ideal because if you faint or

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,690
if you're looking for external

00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,790
applicants you're having to because they

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,810
are giving you your time you it's you

00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,430
know there's a nice gesture to

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,300
compensate them for giving your time in

00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,300
resources

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:35,739
I have a question if no one else does

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:37,840
can I have a question yeah Mike I was

00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:39,070
just wondering if you wash it two

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,080
questions Allah says do one now because

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,059
we have time but do you combine this

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,340
with any other types of testing for

00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:46,779
example we recently discovered that one

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,759
of the reasons that people weren't using

00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:50,739
a certain feature was because it was

00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,200
broken but we didn't know it because we

00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,340
don't use the product you know that

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,989
particular thing like they couldn't even

00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,639
get to the whatever it was they were

00:24:55,989 --> 00:25:00,190
trying to get to and we didn't actually

00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:02,320
realize it and so do you do any sort of

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,480
say I don't know if you have a web

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,919
web-based thing like selenium testing or

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,019
something like that right do you do you

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,869
have that as well so testing in terms of

00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:12,190
all of all features of the whole product

00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:13,809
well I mean obviously that would be on

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,549
the the development side but like from

00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,989
sort of a dots this was actually from a

00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:19,509
Doc's perspective like we were having

00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:27,009
trouble getting people to our dogs all

00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:29,739
right okay I'm I'm sure it's not just

00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:31,239
offer on the support so therefore the

00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:36,669
technical writers perspective when we

00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:38,169
test these aspects of our product or I

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,690
guess the other thing is I mean maybe

00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,009
from your perspective being able to time

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,570
just make sure that something hasn't

00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:47,039
changed that they didn't tell you about

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,039
which is usually what happened to us

00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:53,249
know generally if there's a if we're

00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:55,720
getting a lot of support requests and

00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:58,749
regarding the same issue then that's

00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,059
when we speak to and the management team

00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:01,480
or to developers and say my scar hairs

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,700
together

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,299
I hit what can we do to improve the

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:10,539
situation for our users cool Cheers

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,899
that's nice so much and with that we are

00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,899
