Spreadsheets are peak civilization, and those who disagree will be turning in their cloud-based microservice blockchain of functional things by the end of this talk. Spreadsheets have a UI that most people are familiar with, come batteries included, and holy COUNTIF, have you heard about macros?

Join Josh for a joyride down the boulevard of boring technology and explore examples of the genuinely useful and sometimes ridiculous things you can do with spreadsheets.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
