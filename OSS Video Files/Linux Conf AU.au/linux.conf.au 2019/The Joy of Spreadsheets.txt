Spreadsheets are peak civilization, and those who disagree will be turning in their cloud-based microservice blockchain of functional things by the end of this talk. Spreadsheets have a UI that most people are familiar with, come batteries included, and holy COUNTIF, have you heard about macros?

Join Josh for a joyride down the boulevard of boring technology and explore examples of the genuinely useful and sometimes ridiculous things you can do with spreadsheets.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

thank you Chris yeah so hi I'm Josh and

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,120
this is a talk that initially meant was

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,790
meant to be sort of a lightning talk

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,230
stunt talk joke but actually the more I

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,299
work with spreadsheets the more serious

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,500
I am that they're awesome and we should

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,400
all be more familiar with them

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,350
so just real briefly disclaimer I am

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,029
here representing myself I do work for

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,260
Google I am a volunteer for the open

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:31,550
source initiative but I don't represent

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:34,649
either of them here today so this for me

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:37,440
can't hear me well no okay

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:41,370
I will work on projecting so this for me

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,600
is like an ode to old or boring or

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,660
uncool technology I think most of us

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,890
know many of us knows that in tech whoo

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,300
shiny is is sort of the the thing that

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:59,719
drives many hard careers in many of our

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:02,760
technical decisions unfortunately so I

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,680
was going through some things that I

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,280
inherited from my grandfather who passed

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,010
away last year and he worked for Hughes

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,229
Aircraft Company who worked on projects

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,909
like Voyager for NASA and I was going

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,310
through some of the manuals some of the

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,770
things that he had in his office and I

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,570
noticed that this one page

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:28,170
that seems timeless in this large report

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,210
about some technology I couldn't

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,829
understand I found this one little

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:38,720
nugget don't discard old old techniques

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,650
and they were saying this in 1983 and a

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,530
mechanical electrical engineering

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:49,130
context we know also that it's true in

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:52,829
software development as well and I think

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,990
there's a lot to that so

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,460
the vert the merits of spreadsheets why

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,229
am I here talking about spreadsheets

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,259
aside from the fact that I just have too

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,500
much fun with them they're familiar so a

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,299
lot of people inevitably end up using

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,340
spreadsheets whether it's for managing

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,670
their personal budgets for managing

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,840
projects you know whatever the case may

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,209
be most people who work with

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
Peter's ultimately at some point end up

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,790
working with spreadsheets so they're

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,190
familiar batteries are very much

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,160
included you've got string manipulation

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,750
functions you've got of course a ton of

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,690
things for working with numbers whether

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:36,250
it's statistics or geometry or calculus

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,019
or calculating interest rates you name

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,959
it it's it's all there of course it also

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,599
has a number of logical operators so

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,989
your formulas can get ridiculous and do

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:52,870
pretty sophisticated things they're

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,670
maintainable so one thing I've run into

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,209
you is I've I've built a bunch of tools

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,720
with spreadsheets and I've added a lot

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:04,150
of code to them which is makes them less

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,340
maintainable ideally you use

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,250
spreadsheets and mostly use formulas

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,040
only because formulas are things that

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,230
anybody can edit pretty freely

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,720
the idea behind me saying that

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,010
spreadsheets are maintainable ish is

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,299
that you don't necessarily need a

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,769
software developer to maintain a

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:25,269
spreadsheet which is great because

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,250
especially if you're like me and you

00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:30,190
work on a team of program managers who

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,440
do outreach some of us have technical

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,389
background some of us don't all of us

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,829
know spreadsheets so if I build tools

00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:39,639
and spreadsheets they feel comfortable

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:43,419
and urging them which is great they're

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:46,019
super extensible like really really

00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,310
extensible you can add custom formulas

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,419
yeah of course you can do macros which

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,930
means you can do basically anything

00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:55,530
because whether it's visual VBA or

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,230
Google Apps Script or whatever

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:02,230
LibreOffice calc uses you can basically

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,169
do anything plug spreadsheets into

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,299
anything and this is one thing that I

00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:09,069
really love is that because spreadsheets

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,609
applications that manage spreadsheets

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:15,310
come with other office applications they

00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:17,579
integrate pretty nicely with other back

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,160
office applications so that might be

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:25,659
Gmail that might be that might be

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,670
outlook that might be Docs so you can do

00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:31,620
some ridiculously

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,180
kissing's by gluing these together so

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm gonna tell you a little about what I

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:46,570
have been doing with spreadsheets so I'm

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,370
a CFO for the open source initiative so

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,770
I naturally have an excuse to work with

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,720
dollar figures a lot every year I build

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,610
an annual budget for us as well as

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,910
financial projections to help us figure

00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,570
out like help us you know make decisions

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:04,650
about how we spend money of course use

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,390
them to calculate interest payments was

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,370
2017 June of 2017 when Chris and I

00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,020
bought a new car and we were trying to

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,960
figure out how we should finance it and

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,370
I remember we were figuring out what the

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,490
trade-offs were between various

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:22,120
scenarios and Christmases want to do

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:26,170
pulls out a command you know pulls out

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,190
his terminal opens Python and starts

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,440
thinking about okay well how am I going

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,770
to do the math to figure out these

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,050
different scenarios being that I live in

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,620
spreadsheets practically I said wait a

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,060
second

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,190
I think there are some functions that

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,730
can help us do this and sure enough like

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:45,610
they're the built in so that was an

00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,370
obvious choice for us there are a lot of

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,610
other examples sort of moving up the

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,320
chain of complexity and ridiculousness

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,730
that I would like to share but really we

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,370
only have so much time so I'm just going

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,630
to jump to the most ridiculous thing

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,420
that I personally have done with

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:05,670
spreadsheets which is something just

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,670
build a tool that I call the generator

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,710
so through google Summer of Code and

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,100
google code-in which are outreach

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,980
programs that our team runs to get

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:21,250
students into open-source we have to do

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:25,060
a lot of say high-touch interaction with

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,130
people we have to send visa letters to

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,080
mentors who want to attend the mentor

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,970
summit we have to send visa letters to

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,490
students who won the google code-in

00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,950
contest and want to attend a grand prize

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:41,190
trip we have to send them certificates

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:45,009
and all manner of like things that are

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,810
personalized to them and could we do

00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:51,970
this with our web apps that run the

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:54,190
programs yeah we could but do we know

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,710
instead I built something called the

00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:00,669
generator and what it does is it takes a

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,250
data source which is a sheet and it

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,400
takes templates which take the form of

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,520
markdown documents or Google Docs and

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,310
what it does is it merges that data

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,919
source with those templates and it will

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,830
send personalized emails with

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:22,560
personalized attachments now this may

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:24,909
not sound all that exciting to you but

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,720
some back of the napkin math shows that

00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:32,889
I've saved about 0.6 of a full-time

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,199
employee just over the last year by

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,120
having created the generator there are

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,190
all manner of ridiculous things

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,509
repetitive error-prone things that we

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:44,699
were doing that we're no longer doing

00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:48,310
because the generator is doing it so

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:55,630
because we can I'm just going to show

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:57,940
you a little bit so this is a this is

00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,639
the generator you'll notice there's a

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,960
there's a preset worksheet there's an

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,340
archive with all the stuff that we've

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,020
already generated and sorted out and

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,909
then there's a queue of things that have

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,699
been recently done or still need to be

00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:12,580
done one thing that's a challenge with

00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:17,319
spreadsheets is frankly they're not that

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:20,440
readable and and so I've created a thing

00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,240
that allows you to select a row and view

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,729
its contents on the side and maybe take

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,560
some actions on it this is a pattern

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:28,830
that we actually see a lot at work so we

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,509
have a spreadsheet for lots of things

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,520
and tons of data and then and we use

00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,899
little sidebars that just load in the

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,640
key details for us that makes it a

00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:39,430
little easier for us to review them so

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,510
we're not scrolling horizontally across

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:45,490
massive spreadsheets all the time so

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,320
there's the side bar there's the menu

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,579
that I've added that has all manner of

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,860
things super exciting there's a total

00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:54,960
there's a workflow that I've built here

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,610
so initially

00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,860
what would happen is you would set the

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,800
generator off doing some work it would

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,350
do some work and after five minutes it

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,090
would die because with Google Apps

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,530
Script there's a time out if your script

00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:12,700
takes more than five minutes to complete

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:16,330
it will just timeout so what I've done

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:19,660
is I've built a an interface on top of a

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:22,660
spreadsheet questionable but it's been

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,200
done and what this does is it allows

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,160
people to go through the workflow and

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,730
then ultimately you know configure

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,610
configure things

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,510
preview it some test emails etc and

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,720
ultimately arrive at something like this

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:42,850
that we'll use as a you know just makes

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,380
asynchronous JavaScript calls to

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,230
actually process the stuff on the back

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,390
end and one or two minute chunks and it

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,420
calls back reports on its progress and

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:55,270
then kicks off again so now we've got a

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,880
thing where I think there are maybe 20

00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,560
presets in this tool these are all

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,480
things that we need to do multiple times

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,470
every year with hundreds or thousands of

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,600
people we will go in to the generator

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,990
we'll pull up that preset we'll point it

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,540
to a data source and the templates and

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:16,240
then we will set it going and the nice

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,150
thing is we can actually like click

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:25,030
start and walk away and this will take

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:26,770
care of the work for us because you'll

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:30,340
notice here there's like there's a quota

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:35,170
I mentioned down here 1999 email

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:36,970
recipients left near quota as an

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,940
individual I can only send about 2,000

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,520
emails and every 24 hours before getting

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,960
my account lock down which is probably a

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,960
reasonable thing for Google to be doing

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:52,030
sometimes we have way more emails than

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,240
that to send out so what we do is we

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:58,090
will load things into the generator and

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,460
I will exhaust my quota and then I'll

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,470
tell my colleague to pick up where I

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,770
left off and so my colleague can go

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,770
ahead

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:11,639
figure out which things they want to

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:16,230
work on and go ahead and complete the

00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:19,529
task so this is a maybe going a little

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:22,860
too far with spreadsheets and you can

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:25,829
answer that yourself but it works and it

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:31,110
saves us a lot of time which is what

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:34,769
really matters for us so on the topic of

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,649
going too far when all you have a

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,759
spreadsheet all you have as a tool of

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,660
the spreadsheets and everything looks

00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,980
good problem you should probably solve

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,589
with spreadsheets and that's what I've

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,500
been doing

00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:49,649
until one day I thought maybe I've

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,750
someone who of all the formal training I

00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:55,620
have which is actually not a whole lot I

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,930
have formal training in SQL and working

00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,399
with databases and one day when I found

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,199
myself writing a function called left

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,199
join sheets I thought

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:12,209
yeah I thought maybe maybe I've gone too

00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:14,250
far that function still lives in a few

00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,660
things that I've made I have found other

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,350
ways to approach that that are far more

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,060
reasonable so you know if you hit if you

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,600
if you hit left joint sheets you've gone

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:29,370
too far but other people have taken this

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,680
far further than I have there is this is

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,660
a terrible screenshot I apologize for

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,949
that but there's an individual who has

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:41,850
built a version of the to 2048 game in

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:43,199
Excel they've actually also like changed

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,130
its format so it looks like you're

00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:52,230
working on financial statements a little

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:55,709
subversive there but you can do more

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,529
than things that you know are fun but

00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:05,550
still look ultimately like a spreadsheet

00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:14,130
you could build monopoly or you could

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:17,759
build a 3d game so not content to just

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:20,819
drop that and not show you what I'm

00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,230
talking about we're going to watch about

00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:25,699
a minute and seven seconds of this

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,699
glorious thing here

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,639
yeah the frame rates not great so

00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,990
now what's really incredible about this

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,980
so while I've gone off in built tools

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,900
with spreadsheets that use tons of code

00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:03,670
this can actually be accomplished with

00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:05,590
no code at all and just formulas the

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,420
Post that provides more information

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:12,190
about this is fascinating and it's it's

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:20,530
well worth the read I mean come on how

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:22,360
cool is that so that so that is where if

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,650
you read the original post you'll find

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,200
that the the author says they were able

00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:29,260
to build a 3d rendering engine and and

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,630
all manner of things with just formulas

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,940
but they did have to use macros or code

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,360
to actually accept keyboard input

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,770
otherwise they could only take action

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:53,110
when someone changes the value in a cell

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:55,810
right okay okay so that's all well and

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:59,650
good that's entertaining but seriously

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,770
could we actually use modern development

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,500
work flows around spreadsheets and the

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:08,620
answer is maybe

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:11,050
version control yeah yeah you can do

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,260
that no problem Libre Office article

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:17,380
here has notes that there's a way to

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,660
save the sheets as XML files so that

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,550
it's not a binary blob that's just

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,240
messing up your your get repo or

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:28,750
whatever with Excel it's a little um

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,210
little more complicated I wasn't able to

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,610
find an answer to whether you could

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,410
reasonably version the excel document

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:40,300
itself but you certainly can with VBA

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,960
code and it's built into sheets which is

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,790
very convenient

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:48,460
now both version control for the for the

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:52,510
document as well as the any code that

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,870
you write on top of it what about

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,870
deployment

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,490
I'm not sure really really not sure how

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,290
you would achieve that with calc or

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,880
Excel these are files that you're

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,180
shipping around they're not necessarily

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,690
like services that you could seamlessly

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,790
roll out updates to but you came with

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,980
Google sheets which is kind of cool

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,330
so there's a new tool within rolled out

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,250
in the last couple years called clasp

00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:23,200
which is a command-line utility for

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,340
working with Google Apps Script so you

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:31,540
can work on your code locally you can

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,490
deploy it you conversion it etc because

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,260
you have your code stored locally not

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,720
only then could you have it stored in

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,450
Google's own like Google Drive version

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,250
control version control system but you

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:47,050
could also have it in get or mercurial

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:49,900
or your favorite version control you can

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,700
also use add-ons so you know they're

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,470
like Chrome and Firefox and other

00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,260
browsers extensions turns out there are

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,600
also extensions and add-ons for for

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,870
individual applications within gee suite

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,650
and add-ons is a way where you actually

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:11,650
could roll out changes deploy changes to

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:14,770
your code to users so you couldn't

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,180
exactly have the most modern development

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,600
workflow around this kind of stuff not

00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,130
easily at least it takes some effort but

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,860
if you're using something like sheets

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:30,280
and clasp you can absolutely work on

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:33,580
your code locally have deploy it after

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,900
going through a code review process you

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,340
can have it in version control you can

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,790
do all of the things that you typically

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,080
want to do testing and ok maybe it's not

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,400
going to be completely modern workflow

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:50,500
but you can get a little closer ok so

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:52,360
what so what there's one thing in all of

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:57,280
this that I'm actually serious about and

00:17:52,360 --> 00:18:00,820
that's old technology established

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,310
technology it's really easy for us to

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,680
use whatever tool we're familiar with or

00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,420
using in the moment on any given problem

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,130
so for myself

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,940
I was a Drupal web developer for about

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,380
10 years and everything I built was on

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,730
Drupal whether it was a small

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:20,890
informational website a back-office

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:22,870
application or I actually built some

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,340
games on Drupal 2 which was kind of

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,430
ridiculous probably not the right choice

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:32,020
to make there so when we're thinking

00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:35,320
about making choosing technologies to

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:38,230
solve problems let's keep in mind that

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,270
there are established solutions that may

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,390
not be like the flavor of the moment but

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:47,230
are entirely adequate let's also keep in

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,700
mind that for a lot of things if this is

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,810
a tool that is going to be used by

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,400
people who don't don't code or this is a

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,320
tool that you want people to feel

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,870
ownership in and you want them to be

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,400
able to maintain it spreadsheets are

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:04,390
familiar to just about everybody who

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,070
works in an office so you know maybe

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,360
don't write an application and find

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,160
yourself writing a function called left

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,420
join sheets but consider spreadsheets

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:19,920
thank you

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:19,920
