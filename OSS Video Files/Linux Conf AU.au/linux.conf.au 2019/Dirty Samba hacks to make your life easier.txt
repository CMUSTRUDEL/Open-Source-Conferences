Thanks to the proliferation of IoT devices Samba is everywhere.
But what if you want to use it the "normal" way? You know, as a DC and file server for a large number of users?
What happens when you need to parse the directory for a list of disabled users and take action? Or have regular helpdesk guys deal with locked files?
For regularly running scripts what returns queries faster; pdbedit or ldapsearch?
Perhaps you'd like to setup a linux based hotdesk that will automatically RDP into whatever workstation a user happens to be logged into elsewhere on campus. How to you remotely (and securely) request that information from Samba?
How about a website that acts as a password reset portal? (don't forget your input validation!)
During this talk I will outline and demo a number of scripts and hacks used to make Samba work for our organization (including links to source code).

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
