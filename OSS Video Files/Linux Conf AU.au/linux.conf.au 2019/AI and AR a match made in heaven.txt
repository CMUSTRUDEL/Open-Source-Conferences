I will discuss my journey to bridge the digital world and the physical world with my Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence based artworks and demonstrate artworks made by other artists working in AR and AI while discussing the technologies involved and the impact they will have on development, art and the way we view the world. 

From computer vision to style transfers, Generative Adversarial Networks and Image Classifiers and Augmented Reality platforms, I will explore the highs, the lows, the creepy and the exciting moments that come from working as an artist collaborating with a computer.
