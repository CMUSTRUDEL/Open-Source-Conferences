https://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/219/

For Christmas 2018 I made an IoT-enabled LED star for our Christmas tree. 
I designed it in an afternoon and had the circuit boards in my hands 5 days later, for a cost of $5.00 for ten.

Learn how to get the most out of PCB design tools and PCB manufacture services to let your electronic circuits become a feature of your art.

A circuit board doesn't have to be green, and it doesn't have to be rectangular.  You can make your circuit part of your art by varying
  * the shape of the board itself, or
  * including artistic elements in the silk-screen overlay, or even
  * make your copper tracks an artwork of their own

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

that's time so Christopher's from

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,820
Brisbane I'm and he is an IOT expert I

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,120
would describe him as um he's convener

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,340
of the Brisbane IOT Internet group he

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,869
also has a consulting firm doing IOT

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,449
work he has a huge interest in

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,789
electronics he's shared a lot of really

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,410
interesting hardware and software

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:35,360
projects at LCA before what he's talking

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:39,360
about today is an LED Christmas star

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,730
which he made and designed in an

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,879
afternoon had the circuit boards

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,550
produced custom and he's going to walk

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,860
us through the process of how he made

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,920
that project and then take that a bit

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,039
further and looking at PCB reffered PCB

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,870
design tools and how everybody can make

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,390
the most of these opportunities - I'm

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,149
not just wire hardware and software

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,150
together but actually design the the

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,490
physical units to kind of reflect the

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,200
the kind of purpose that you want to put

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:16,680
them to and how we can turn that into a

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,870
creative art form so let's give her a

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,889
round of applause for Christopher

00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,889
[Applause]

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,560
lovely we're living ok so my name is

00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:44,920
Chris and today I want to tell you about

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,910
the things that I do on the intersection

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,230
of Technology and art and how hopefully

00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,910
I can convince you that you can do this

00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,080
too that it's not as frightening as you

00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,810
thought so I'm not an electronics

00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,790
engineer by training I'm a computer

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,770
programmer but I have been involved with

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,220
electronic gadgets since I was a

00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,810
teenager and as a hobby through our 20

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,290
odd years as a software engineering

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,170
manager and a few years ago I decided to

00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,360
to take that passion full-time and so

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,070
now in my day job I operate a business

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,590
called accelerator which helps

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,470
businesses use technology to reduce

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,690
stress because really that's what I

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,940
believe that technology is the gradual

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,050
process of freeing the human race from

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,670
drudgery and fear and so I started my

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,900
business because I wanted to contribute

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,680
to the kind of future that I would be

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,209
excited to live in at the last LCA I

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,430
talked about rapid manufacturing

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:45,160
techniques such as 3d printing and laser

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,140
cutting and I touched briefly on

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,790
electronics in that talk but I didn't

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,440
really have time to go into much detail

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:59,110
so here we are and I enter the year but

00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,390
first I want to talk about why I want to

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,180
talk about what I want to talk about did

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,980
you follow that there's a lot of

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,610
confusion about what the Internet of

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:13,420
Things really means as a sector and as a

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:17,440
movement like any new buzzword there's a

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,510
lot of piling on by existing players who

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,510
simply want to siphon off my chair

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:27,550
from a new technology but what the

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:30,489
Internet of Things means for me is using

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,880
low-cost computers and the

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:38,130
communications between large numbers of

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:40,889
them to improve our lives which

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,340
dovetails neatly into my approach to art

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,730
there's a perception

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,230
that technical folks are not arty but in

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:55,130
reality there's a there's a huge

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:57,680
movement and subculture among technical

00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:01,190
people of Creative Arts I think it stems

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,840
from the fact that technical people

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,730
spend a lot of time working on abstract

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,970
concepts or working on things that are

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:10,459
literally behind the walls and so when

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,900
you're at that Christmas barbecue or at

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,780
the pub and somebody says what what do

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,930
you do it's very difficult to show

00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,600
people what you do so having art is a

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,270
fabulous release for technologists in

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:30,250
being able to demonstrate something that

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:32,930
I made which is not always to say that

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,210
our creative inputs go in the wrong way

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:41,210
now as it's undeniable that people are

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:42,410
creative it's perhaps debatable as to

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,120
whether some of the things we create or

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:49,550
a good idea this is a television from

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,340
the 1930s and the reason I'm showing it

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,260
to you is I want to tell you about what

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,200
life was like before the technologies we

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,520
have today this is a bunch of electronic

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,490
components that are simply all wired

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,039
together maybe they're stuck to a bit of

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,789
cardboard or bakelite and then they're

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:10,250
wired up and each each television wasn't

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:15,139
was an individual work of of

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:17,110
construction and as electronics moved

00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,250
into taking over our lives this became

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:26,810
very much a break on the kind of things

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:29,210
that we could do and so experimentally

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,970
in the 20s and 30s but then increasingly

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,289
in the 1940s 50s we started using

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:41,510
different technologies to put together

00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:43,910
our electronics and in general I think

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,100
that technology is the art of thinking

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:50,150
about a better way of living our lives

00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:53,240
and building our society so the better

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,919
way from that Masson inside the the

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,210
1930s TV cabinet is what we call the

00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,160
printed circuit board and the idea is

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,199
that you've got a sheet of fiberglass

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,090
you've got a thin sheet of copper rolled

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,580
onto the side and then somehow you get

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,880
rid of the copper that you don't want in

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:14,970
order to in order to replace all those

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:18,000
wires with a a single set of connections

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,319
that are permanently fixed on onto that

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,440
piece of fiberglass now this is one that

00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,030
I actually made in my kitchen and I'll

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:30,780
be recommending that you don't do this

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:34,199
because it's easy it's relatively cheap

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,150
it's not particularly dangerous but

00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,530
we're at the point now where the

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:42,180
commercial services that will do this

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:45,320
for you are so painless and and quick

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,580
and and their quality is so good that

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,500
the number of ways that we used to do

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,599
this in the in the Oh all the other

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,690
small workshop are very much becoming

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,669
obsolete and this is what the front of

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,370
that board looks like this is a system

00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,770
that I made to try and had my children

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,690
off from there their tendency to get up

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,889
into the middle of our night turn on

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,120
every light in the house on the way to

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,380
the bathroom and then go straight back

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,960
to bed and leave them all and so this

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,669
controls with a motion sensor the

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,039
lighting in the bathroom and flips it on

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:16,169
it's been sitting in my in my bathroom

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,500
for about 15 years now and it's still

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:21,210
ticking along but the general

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,099
illustration here is you have a bunch of

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,800
electronic components that you stick to

00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,110
your board and then they're soldered on

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,699
the back side and this is how

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,740
practically everything that we interact

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:36,449
with it is electronic is is made today

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:38,400
and the interesting thing is that some

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:43,620
of our most commonly used appliances

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,690
like like televisions DVD players and

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,440
such like and not using techniques that

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,120
are much more complicated than this our

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,419
computers our phones especially are

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,169
using many many generations ahead of

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:02,639
this but it's interesting to me that a

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:03,960
lot of technological niches are really

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,599
quite conservative in that they're using

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:10,409
techniques that arose half a century ago

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,520
and they haven't changed them and so

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,919
today I'm going to talk to you about a

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,070
number of tools that you can use to get

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:21,839
from a jumble of wires to something that

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:24,089
is robust and able to be reproduced and

00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:29,990
will survive the journey in your

00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:34,229
suitcase from from A to B and this is a

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,810
program called Fritzing which is a tool

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:41,880
for guiding you through that process

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:44,910
from jumble of wires to to your finished

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,250
product and this is not unlike what

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,810
Jacob just shows this is a small device

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,510
for making making music and that's what

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,040
you might come up with if you had a

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,360
bunch of parts on your workbench in you

00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,940
just wore them together to see what you

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,140
could do and the next step is to turn

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,449
that into what we call a schematic

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,709
diagram to say okay I've got this part

00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:08,550
of got that part it's hooked up like

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:14,790
this and then we want to make a printed

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:16,709
circuit and up until perhaps the the

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,390
late 1980s this was done by engineers

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:21,570
who would sit there with a pen and paper

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,910
or overall a little black tape and they

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,029
would manually design that that

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,170
conversion from jumble of wires to to

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,720
printed circuit nowadays we have

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,190
software that does it for us so we we

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,600
merely need to say okay I want to put

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,880
this switch here and then that plug

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,070
there wire it up for me and you might

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,420
think I can't do that that's that's way

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,579
too complicated I don't understand

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,260
anything about what's happening here but

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:46,949
what I want to tell you today is that

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,529
you can and it's not that scary so meet

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:53,810
the most successful robot ever the

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:56,160
Roomba it's not actually very good it

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,829
doesn't do much more than drive around

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,260
and bump into things but the important

00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:03,420
thing that it does is it does a job that

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:10,230
we particularly don't want to do well

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:12,660
enough to to carve itself a niche and

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,170
before I go further I want to rewind a

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,570
little bit and look

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,310
look back at how he got here and artists

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:31,770
had a lot more to do with this than you

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:34,540
might think after the Second World War

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:37,120
we started using electronics to control

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,610
a lot of our lives and this is before

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,110
the computer as far as most of us knew

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:46,750
because computers at the time or a

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:48,550
military secret and so these devices

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,210
came along called the programmable logic

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,950
controller which essentially were the

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,450
encapsulation of a bunch of switches and

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,190
timers if you've ever fiddled with a

00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,600
with a washing machine when you have

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,880
that big clicky dial that you have to

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,410
turn to to get your spin cycle or

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,950
whatever this is the kind of technology

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:09,520
that the industrial world still uses

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:16,960
today it's it's remarkably norm

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:21,270
technical so let's fast-forward to to

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,620
the other 20 21st century this is a

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,390
device called the Arduino which which

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,180
many of you might have heard of it was

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,010
really the the watershed in technology

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,950
where it became possible for someone who

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:39,750
was not only an electrical engineer to

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:42,160
automate things to make blinking lights

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,080
musical instruments what-have-you and

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,300
there was actually a huge amount of

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,660
resistance to this from electrical

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,370
engineers it was it was asking for a

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,650
flame war to even talk about this

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,420
product on electrical engineering forums

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,880
because they they dismissed it out of

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,460
hand this is pointless this is junk this

00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,420
is too simple nobody won't like this and

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:06,820
what a lot of people don't know that

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:10,090
this was invented by artists a couple of

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:13,690
a couple of university lecturers in a

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:16,240
pub in Italy sat down and looked at why

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:20,110
is it so hard for our art students to

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:24,700
produce electronic art and the reason is

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:27,590
that the the technology that was there

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,590
for automation

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,670
designed and built by engineers

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,390
conservatively so in that it hadn't

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:41,130
changed significantly for decades and so

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:45,090
these people looked at what could we do

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:49,110
to to make electronics a friendly

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:53,310
workspace and so fast forwarding from

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:55,560
there the Arduino came along around 2005

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:59,900
over the next 10 years they got smaller

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:04,620
and faster more processors more memory

00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:07,800
and then Wi-Fi comes along so now we're

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,540
at a situation where for five bucks you

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,860
can buy a little circuit board that's

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:20,670
got a brain some memory perhaps a screen

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:22,020
like this one and you can talk to it

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,260
over their network and do all sorts of

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,270
interesting stuff with it

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:32,930
and this is what I think of as the

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:36,090
current sweet spot in in do-it-yourself

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:39,960
electronic installations it's a little

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,760
board called the Holland d1 and the good

00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,290
thing about this is there is no wiring

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,450
if you want to build something you just

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,270
stack them together I want to switch on

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,790
a screen I want a speaker I want some

00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:54,980
lights grab a bunch of modules they cost

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:59,610
a buck or two each stack them together

00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:03,380
and and there's a useful agglomeration

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,400
it doesn't actually look very pretty and

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,260
I'll talk a bit more about that later

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,010
but here we are living in the future and

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:14,460
I really mean that

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:19,650
I I think a lot about where technology

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:22,370
has bought us and and what it what it

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:25,170
might bring the forest in the future I

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:31,410
see a lot of a lot of electronic

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:34,200
scooters around the campus here and if

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,760
you if you invert the perc the progress

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,329
of history and look at one of the things

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,329
that we have now and then

00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:41,559
a start-up came along and said we've got

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:44,379
this new device we're going to call it

00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,249
the automobile and you just buy one and

00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:47,199
then you leave it wherever you want

00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:48,970
around the city for the day and then you

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,839
come back to it when you're finished it

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,839
sounds crazy

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,389
so thinking being about the context of

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:05,139
Technology is is the important thing for

00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:06,850
us to do and so what I want to do now is

00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:09,129
use some of the projects that I've done

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,600
in the last year to illustrate the

00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:14,739
journey from from concept to

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,499
installation and also I want to give you

00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:18,910
some tips about things to think about

00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,069
when you're when you're when you're

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,759
building electronic installations so

00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:26,799
here's a gadget that I built again out

00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,230
of the necessity of improving my

00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,239
children's lives because they are

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:35,829
essentially small biological machines

00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:37,989
for losing house keys so they come home

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:41,709
from school and I get a second thing

00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:43,209
that I like was over again so I built a

00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:45,399
system where they can open the front

00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:48,249
door from their phones it's not pretty

00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:51,910
it's a stack of those d1 modules that

00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:56,410
talks to her talks to a electronic door

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,879
latch and so I found myself wiring up

00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,910
the same little gadget over and over

00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,139
again for it for a couple of door door

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,119
installations around the house and

00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,949
around my office and I thought okay well

00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:12,100
obviously he's a component that I need

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:13,989
to build so I designed and built a

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,369
module that fits on that stack that does

00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:20,410
the particular thing I need to do talk

00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:21,999
to that door latch and one of the things

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,769
I want to point out about this is is

00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:29,529
going back to today's keynote the

00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:32,829
documentation all the connections about

00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:35,949
how to use it about what it does where

00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:36,970
to get the instructions even printed on

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:40,480
the circuit board as part of the

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,069
manufacturing process but that's still

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,649
that's a little bit messy

00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:46,420
that's stack of boards so let's think

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:50,220
about needing things up

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,220
and the good thing for us as

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,220
non-specialists electronic dabblers is

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,570
that there's a huge variety of

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,110
inexpensive little modules that we can

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:05,650
we can glom together to do our job so

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:09,669
these are essentially the process are in

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,829
memory and Wi-Fi out of out of one of

00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:14,380
those d1 boards stuck under a little

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,569
module that's an Australian 5 cent piece

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,600
there so we're looking at a module

00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:24,939
that's maybe eight or ten millimeters

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:27,640
across what this allows us to do is to

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,290
build remarkably complex stuff from

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,840
simple parts now this next one probably

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:36,160
gonna frighten you but this is something

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,049
that we built to help a client who was

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,700
building senses that they were going to

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:41,470
put under the road where they literally

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,470
drill a hole in the in the Asheville

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,880
drop it in there and concrete it in and

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,370
the problem with that is is if you stuff

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,640
it up its back our time to go and fix it

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,500
so they wanted a way to to turn these

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,110
things off and reboot them should they

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,179
go berserk and so we built this little

00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,809
system which just does that one thing it

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,220
fellas

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:09,040
allows you to talk to it over Wi-Fi and

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:10,809
control a relay and it's really just two

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,429
of those two of those little plugin

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,799
modules together you've got a brain

00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:16,960
you've got a relay you've got some

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,510
lights for helping you understand what

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:25,240
it's doing and this is something that

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:27,220
was designed by one of my team who had

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,770
never never never built a commercials

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:33,429
that could put before he he sat down and

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:36,100
in the course of a couple of days went

00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,110
from okay here's our prototype bundle of

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,000
wires to here's something that we can

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,370
build a few dozen of them and try them

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,360
out in the field and if you're wondering

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:49,480
look what you can do with the with the

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,950
little Raspberry Pi board that came in

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,230
your swag bag if you were lucky enough

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:57,580
to get one then our next iteration of

00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,049
that product got a little bit more

00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,630
complex we design something that would

00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:01,340
clip

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,690
the top of a Raspberry Pi so the

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,090
Raspberry Pi does all the thinking

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:08,260
that's a single board computer that's

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:11,290
approximately as as powerful as a

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:14,030
cellular phone from a few years ago

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,680
which is to say approximately power as

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:19,790
powerful as a supercomputer from a

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:23,000
decade ago and one of the things I want

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:30,560
to point it out to you as a possibility

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:33,320
is that you're not limited to the

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,120
rectangle so in this case we had some

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,540
switches we had some connections to

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,890
batteries and to to outside things that

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,810
we were powering and we built the

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:47,450
circuit board too to carry all that

00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:51,380
design along with it so that there was

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:58,250
only one way to put it together and we

00:19:51,380 --> 00:20:00,440
also incorporated the the light switch

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,540
which tell you what it's doing that

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,940
would become the control panel onto the

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,350
circuit board so when you're designing a

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,290
circuit board you have the ability to

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,870
think about the the physical form factor

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:20,000
of what you're going to do and shape it

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:20,840
however you want to to make it as simple

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,170
as possible

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:28,790
so next next step up the complexity

00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:30,170
chain perhaps to the extreme looks a

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,920
little more complex but again not really

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:36,980
it's it's again out a little Wi-Fi

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,480
module it's got a radio module for for

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,250
long long distance low-power

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,730
communications and all it does is

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,810
listens to your water meter and

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,310
transmits it's little blips that it

00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,030
makes every time the needle goes around

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,080
up to the internet which lets

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,180
multi-tenant dwellings understand the

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,010
water usage of their tendencies and such

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,980
things without having to go and replace

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:00,700
all their metering with smart metering

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:09,830
and again this was something that that

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:12,370
we prototypes as as a bit of wiring we

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:17,710
built a dozen or so of them to do

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:19,870
trials and the complexity is really just

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,550
at the level of of plugging Lego blocks

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,070
together now this is something that is

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:28,720
far more complicated this is an

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:31,990
evolution of our road traffic

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,250
underground control system but the

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,950
reason I'm telling you this is to point

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,840
out that even this which is far far

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,520
beyond my capabilities was designed by

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,429
one of my interns who's an undergraduate

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:49,230
so there is a long way that a non

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:51,910
specialist can get ya with modern tools

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,110
we did take us a couple of revisions and

00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,010
to get this right and one of the things

00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,059
I want to suggest to you is it if you

00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:01,179
you're getting printed circuit boards

00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:03,190
made the color is largely irrelevant

00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:05,140
except that if you make version one

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,470
yellow one version two green version

00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:16,630
three pink and four white you don't get

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:19,929
them mixed up so much another thing

00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:22,929
that's that's really helpful is touch

00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:25,780
screens are dirt cheap so nowadays you

00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:30,580
can get one for well under ten bucks

00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:32,470
which means that having to listen to

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,540
beeps to figure out why something's not

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,860
working or that horrible experience

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,059
we're trying to set the clock on your

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,309
car and you have to hold the button down

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,960
for five seconds wait till the flashes

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:41,950
and then push it again and if you stuff

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,970
it up you have to get back to the

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,290
beginning that's one of the things that

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,330
we really oughta consigned at the bit of

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,550
history because we're now at the point

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,660
where everything can have a screen for

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,660
basically no extra cost

00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:02,050
bonus tip again from this designer I

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,800
don't expect that any of us will be

00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,790
building things this complicated but

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,700
there's a little screw hold on it's

00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,990
calling that board and they're actually

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,700
mounted onto the circuit board as if as

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,309
if that was just solder on components so

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,110
it's not just electrical components that

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:19,720
we can put onto these assemblies we can

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,190
we can put screws this one's got fuses

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,570
this one's got connectors this one's

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,309
actually got other circuit boards which

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,049
plug in that I replaceable should it be

00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:30,470
like then we can rip that part out and

00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:33,909
replace it with another one so those are

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:39,860
the kinds of things that you can do to

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:43,690
to turn your jumble of of components and

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:47,090
wiring into something that's more robust

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:52,159
so I want to go through now a quick

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:56,690
journey from sketchbook idea to final

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,999
product to to show you again how the

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:03,019
tools help us do that quite simply so I

00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:04,700
was asked to come up with a with a

00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:06,889
display for an aircraft hangar that

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,869
would tell people the outside wind

00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:10,039
speeds I've got anemometers up on the

00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:12,980
building they know how fast the wind's

00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:14,869
blowing all around the airport but

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,360
inside the hangars with the door shut

00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,499
you might not know so before you open

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,679
the door it's good to know you know

00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:27,110
what's the wind like outside and I won't

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:29,450
say where these are installed but new

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,590
zealanders if you you feel like invading

00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:40,429
Australia do it on windy day where

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:44,450
frightened to come out outside so we

00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:47,119
start with with an Arduino brain some

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:51,019
communications modules some really quite

00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:55,460
large light emitting diode numbers and

00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:57,619
then we latch knees up into a into an

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,419
initial prototype now the approach we

00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,600
took here is using some stuff called

00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:04,940
viewer board which is just if you've

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,889
used a breadboard which is essentially a

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,830
bunch of little spring clips that are

00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:13,369
connected in rows this is the soluble

00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,840
equivalent where you've got a bunch of

00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:17,330
wires that my name run in one direction

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,950
and where you want to cut them you just

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:26,899
use a scalpel or or an Stanley knife or

00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:34,009
even a drill bit so our first our first

00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:36,740
prototype was was put together using I

00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:38,649
guess 1960s technology and we did

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,080
actually decide to make our own

00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:45,350
circuit boards to allow us to connect

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,909
the subsequent digits more more

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,559
comfortably and this is another

00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:49,490
possibility for making your own circuit

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,830
boards which is using a

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,889
computer-controlled milling machine to

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,929
actually cut the ball the circuit out of

00:25:54,889 --> 00:26:00,740
the copper and once again don't do it

00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:03,649
because it's noisy it's messy it's

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,149
relatively cheap you can buy spend a

00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:09,409
couple hundred dollars to get a machine

00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:13,220
that will do this for you but again it's

00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:17,210
a technology that's that's really past

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,830
its use-by date so I want to show you as

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,289
an example of that little small board Oh

00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,330
is cutting out there the next level in

00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:26,000
in computer-aided design tools this is a

00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:28,190
tool called Eagle which is now owned by

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,429
Autodesk can make AutoCAD and a number

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:35,029
of other well-known tools and it's free

00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:37,460
for for small open-source projects and

00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:39,169
it's relatively cheap in the commercial

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,279
realm particularly compared to some of

00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:47,990
the some of the incumbents in the

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:49,639
business so we start with our with our

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,740
simple circuit diagram which in this

00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:54,289
case is I've got five widely spaced pins

00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,779
on one of those big LED displays and I

00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:58,970
want to convert it down to a closer

00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:05,600
closer together set of pins that fit the

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:07,759
cable that I have and this is the design

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,480
that we came up with him when I say we

00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:13,820
it was actually John Walker who convened

00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:17,600
the the open hardware many conf

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,759
yesterday who did this design for me but

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,559
the idea we came up with was let's not

00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,419
use a couple of little circuit boards

00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:26,269
here and there let's make one enormous

00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:31,370
circuit board that we put these big and

00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:33,710
there this high light displays on which

00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,029
gives us everything together in one unit

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,460
that we can put in a box and hang on the

00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:41,590
wall and all the does is outside it's

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,590
120 kilometers now when don't go outside

00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,230
and there we go

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,759
[Music]

00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,440
something that we can send off to a to a

00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,059
printed circuit board manufacturer get

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,529
that get the result back in a few days

00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:01,840
and all we have to do is take our

00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:04,019
collection of modules that we that we

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,830
clip together with wires and instead

00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,809
poke them through the holes on this

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,299
board solder the one and there's our

00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,309
project and I keep one of these in my

00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:16,749
office which I use as a number of days

00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:19,240
since the last time the first aid box

00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:21,850
was opened to counter doesn't really

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:30,610
need three digits doesn't only need two

00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:31,809
digits but there you go so if you've you

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,980
ever looked inside a phone or a computer

00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:38,009
these days you'll see that the circuit

00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,940
boards don't have too many of those

00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:41,529
components with pins sticking through

00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:46,289
holes anymore instead we use something

00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:48,669
called surface mount technology which is

00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:50,169
scary initially when you look at it but

00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:53,769
in practice it actually turns out to be

00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:56,970
easier to use and simpler to use that

00:28:53,769 --> 00:29:01,179
and the older technologies in fact I I

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:03,269
often ask my my children and and some of

00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:07,240
my interns who were high school-aged

00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:09,970
kids to put these circuits together for

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,850
me and they find it not a challenge at

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,230
all so he's a project that's been

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,470
kicking around in my head for six months

00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:19,450
or so which is let's build a robot that

00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:23,649
can make custom stickers for our laptops

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,999
and really it's it's just a simple

00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:26,559
example of the kinds of thing that you

00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:30,369
can do with with surface math technology

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:34,929
and some simple modules we began with

00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:37,360
let's get an off-the-shelf compute

00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:38,769
module some motor controllers why them

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,580
all together on a breadboard and just

00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:44,080
confirm that the motors that I found are

00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,379
going to work with this technology and

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,749
it's actually feasible to do what I

00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:51,070
wanted to do and from there we moved on

00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:53,210
to something that's a little more

00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:56,480
portable this is

00:29:53,210 --> 00:30:01,930
again an off-the-shelf component of out

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:04,220
of controllers some motors a servo motor

00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,660
and from their own okay yes this is

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,920
gonna work now I know I want to make it

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:11,480
smaller I want to make something that

00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:14,330
you can plop down on your laptop and

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:21,470
have it draw directly onto your onto

00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:25,940
your case so we we looked at what's this

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:28,610
how small can we get so our target was a

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,980
robot that can draw a 5 by 5 centimeters

00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,240
sticker the robot itself is going to be

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,250
no bigger than about 10 by 10

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,730
centimeters so we made a circuit board

00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,920
that fits along one side of the robot

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:42,740
and it took us again a couple of days to

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,680
get it get it all working we went

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:49,250
through our different cars each time we

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:55,160
selected some switches which on that red

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:56,900
board there actually clip into some

00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,490
holes that are drilled in the board so

00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,960
again we're using the circuit board to

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:05,240
support our our physical installation

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,280
and to put it all together goes back to

00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,340
to what I spoke about last year at LCA

00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:14,360
which is 3d printing and rapid

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:17,180
manufacturing that's my intern

00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,830
Alistair's who was in grade 9 last year

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,870
who he put that together and had an

00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,480
absolute blast doing it and what we come

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,470
up with at the end was this design and

00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,140
again we went through a number of

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,610
iterations of that design and we ended

00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,160
up being about twice as tall as I

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:33,980
thought we would be so instead of

00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:36,740
instead of having a 10 by 4 centimeter

00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,120
board I started thinking about or what

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,160
if I made a circuit board that was the

00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,780
shape of that white end piece there if

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,190
it was about 10 centimeters long and

00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:51,080
maybe six or eight centimeters high but

00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,550
had some legs built into it so now I

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,120
want to talk about the kinds of things

00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:59,020
you can do with shaping your circuit

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,310
board to suit your your installation I

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:04,460
had the Brisbane Internet of Things made

00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:05,850
up which I'm helping to convene we do

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,130
them all evening why

00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,840
nibblies and rabbiting on nights but we

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,990
also do a Saturday afternoon practical

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,660
workshop where we we build some things

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,940
that are of interest to the membership

00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:21,410
and for for December we decided to go

00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,760
with the Christmas theme and I wanted to

00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:27,480
to make some some Christmas tree

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,780
ornaments and so I thought about some

00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,310
some new flashing LED technology that

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,820
had come to market and I thought I

00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:40,020
reckon we can make something that allows

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:42,420
us to - so these little LED sequins onto

00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,470
a quilt or onto a strip where they

00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:48,240
become a Christmas light strip and so a

00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,670
design this round circuit board that is

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,110
this solo and it's literally the

00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,780
simplest circuit you could possibly have

00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,210
it's how it goes in here and there and

00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,660
the light flashes it's not complicated

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:04,410
at all but I wanted to make a lot of

00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,640
them so I designed one and I send it to

00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,340
the printed circuit board manufacturing

00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,930
house and said I want 500 of these what

00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,250
can you do and they said well if we join

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:16,260
them up into a panel and make them

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:22,080
clippable that won't be a problem and so

00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:25,230
when a few days I got back a sheaf of

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,560
these little circuit boards which we

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:30,510
could break apart and again my my wife

00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,610
and children helped in in assembling

00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:36,560
those and we got this year's project

00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:41,900
which is the the animated Christmas tree

00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:45,960
that's a it's a quilted fabric project

00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:50,070
that involves sewing on those those

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,900
little lights and the design of those

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,400
those snowflakes got me thinking well

00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,400
maybe we should make an electronic

00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:02,160
snowflake to be the the curling part of

00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:04,050
that so we designed a star and we

00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,930
figured out how to get it cut out into

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:12,660
that shape we chopped some lights on

00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:14,040
there and not being an electronics

00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:19,230
person I didn't want to deal with the

00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:22,470
having to build the computer deal with

00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:25,970
Communications so I just made it except

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:31,500
an off-the-shelf computer on the back

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:34,590
again it's the the low on d1 cost about

00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:39,590
three to four dollars and so with the

00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:41,820
two of those clipped together we have a

00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:45,899
Christmas tree ornament that can do

00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,030
whatever you want it to do you can you

00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:50,490
can program it to do various patterns

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,840
you can have it so your family can send

00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,010
you an email which changes your

00:34:51,840 --> 00:35:00,359
Christmas tree lights or whatever you

00:34:53,010 --> 00:35:02,280
want and again it's not an engineer I

00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:06,359
wanted to use this as an example of

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,590
trying a different tool I've used Eagle

00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,450
CAD for a number of years and that's

00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,010
well well known in the hobbyist

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:14,369
community as something that's that's

00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:16,740
fairly easy to learn in the open-source

00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:20,369
source world the go-to tool is called

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,859
Chi CAD it's not I would say is easy to

00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:24,720
learn you probably need to have a nerd

00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,359
on call to give you some tips initially

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,369
but I with the help of one of my

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,580
university interns went from complete

00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:36,090
novice to sending this board off for

00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:39,119
manufacturer in the course of about four

00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,640
or five hours so again we start with our

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,290
circuit diagram which is I take an

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,020
existing brain module and I simply

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,310
downloaded the footprint for that off

00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,050
the off the internet I've got some

00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:54,020
lights I chuck them up there and then I

00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:56,640
arrange those into the shape that I want

00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:01,680
have the have the software wire it all

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,630
up and one of the handy things about

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,820
cockade is that will give you a 3d

00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:09,470
visualization of what you designed so it

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:13,290
can say oh it's going to look like this

00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:14,700
and another of the important processes

00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,000
in the in the printed circuit board

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,869
process is you've got your fiberglass

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,480
baseboard

00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:22,650
you've got your copper layers and then

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,359
you've got various layers of paint that

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,119
graph at the top there's there's in this

00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:29,520
case the green is actually an insulating

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,869
paint which helps you not get solder on

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,970
the bit so you don't want to get solder

00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:34,760
on so

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,500
it makes it a lot easier for a novice to

00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,880
just solder this board up because the

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,770
smaller won't stick to the parts where

00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,329
it's not supposed to go whereas if

00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:44,210
you've built one of these boards in your

00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:47,329
tub of acid in the kitchen sink or

00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,730
you're a little robot cutting machine in

00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:51,950
your garage you don't get that benefit

00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,299
and that's another reason why I think

00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:59,480
it's better simply to go to the

00:36:53,299 --> 00:37:01,730
commercial manufacturers these days and

00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,069
so on top of your insulating paint layer

00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:06,950
you get a lot it's called a silkscreen

00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:08,539
layer which is your explanatory text and

00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,349
assembly instructions so in this case

00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:14,210
I've I've got the name of the project

00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:17,000
what all the connections are for and so

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,920
this this gadget can not only light up

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,359
the the star at the top of the Christmas

00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,240
tree I can use it to turn on all the

00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:28,730
extra lights around that that

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:31,000
installation in various combinations so

00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:35,359
when you're going from that software

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,970
from okay I've got a design now I want

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,670
to have it made we're back to

00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:43,579
unfortunately the strange conservatism

00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:47,539
of the electronics world in that there

00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:50,660
are no good open source file formats for

00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:56,180
exporting this it's all de facto

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:58,490
standard proprietary junk but both ego

00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,279
CAD and car cad understand the

00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,510
proprietary junk formats the main ones

00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,819
you'll encounter is is the thing called

00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:09,099
Gerber format which is the name of the

00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:13,400
original originator which describes

00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:15,079
where the copper gets cut away where the

00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,329
silkscreen goes where that masking layer

00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,890
has what the shape of the board is so

00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:21,049
that's controlling essentially the robot

00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,690
that's going to go and and build this

00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,980
board for you and the second thing that

00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,200
you'll be outputting from your software

00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,720
is a description of where to drill the

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,980
holes and that's again another weird

00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,240
proprietary format that nobody

00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,440
understands but the good news is you

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,230
don't really need to know any of this

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,539
you simply go please plot my design

00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:42,339
it'll spit out a bunch of gibberish you

00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:45,819
chuck it in a zip file and upload it to

00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:49,190
your printed circuit board manufacturer

00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:53,660
so for ten of those boards how much did

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:57,410
it cost by bucks not each five bucks for

00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,789
the lot and if you you don't really want

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,140
to learn how to solder or you don't know

00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:02,930
how to solder or it frightens the

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,789
bejesus out of you then if you're

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,950
prepared to wait a little longer than

00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:08,359
then our manufacturing house will

00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:11,329
assemble the whole thing for you and

00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:16,730
send you the finished product how long

00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:18,829
does that take for for a normal

00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,099
thickness circuit board in the standard

00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:25,339
color three to four days plus plus

00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:27,109
shipping time so sending my design from

00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:29,809
here to the manufacturing house zero

00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:31,220
days they'll have a look at tell you

00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:33,230
yeah that looks like it's going to work

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,230
or know you've missed this or that

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,819
doesn't work or that's the wrong format

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:41,089
and so in a couple of hours you'll have

00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:43,460
a go/no-go on your design then it goes

00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:47,930
through the process of etching and

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,369
cutting and painting and then shipping

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,619
back to you you can take anywhere from

00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:54,950
two days to two weeks depending on on

00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:56,480
what option you choose if you need it in

00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,779
a real hurry this places that I'll do

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,329
this for you essentially so next day for

00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:05,839
not a lot more you're talking five bucks

00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:07,819
for the for the one week turnaround you

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,079
can really need it in in one or two days

00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:13,249
you might pay fifty bucks

00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,079
via ten Lords but if you're in that

00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:18,289
situation that's not a huge amount to

00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:20,239
pay if you want different colors if you

00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:22,640
want different thicknesses of boards if

00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,680
you want flexible fancy stuff you'll

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,299
expect to take a little bit longer it

00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,970
might go from two or three days up to a

00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:31,489
five day turnaround and then if you want

00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,259
them to build it for you that then

00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:34,640
requires they're more during the parts

00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:37,609
from somewhere waiting for those parts

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,109
to come scheduling it into their

00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,999
manufacturing process and that might

00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:44,569
take three to four weeks it's not a huge

00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:47,630
amount of time and certainly the

00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:50,539
convenience is hard to beat so what do

00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:53,089
we get out of that we got a Christmas

00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:54,739
project for the meetup that gives us a

00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:57,100
bunch of flashing lights on our

00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:59,830
Christmas quilt and a top

00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:04,500
which is the star which powers off of it

00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:11,920
a USB board and animates into whatever

00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:15,280
patterns we like and what I what I hope

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,930
you can take away from this is that if

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,000
you can join wires together to make

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,790
flashing lights and such like with an

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,400
Arduino it's not actually very scary to

00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:28,990
go from there to something that is more

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,210
robust more reliable able to be produced

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:34,210
by the Dozen 100 if you want to do that

00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:36,660
into an Etsy project or something which

00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:38,310
we've done we're doing with this one

00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,290
[Music]

00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,960
it's pretty simple it's pretty cheap the

00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:48,580
software is out there in several tiers

00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:52,180
from really easy to use to quite

00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:55,740
sophisticated to insanely complex you've

00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:58,630
got a huge amount of options in terms of

00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,890
colors and shapes and placements and

00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,740
things that you can put onto these

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:07,830
circuit boards to augment your art

00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,910
project and despite what you'd think the

00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:11,620
production houses that are going to be

00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,230
building these designs for you more than

00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:18,220
willing to help you as a novice get

00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:20,260
through the process so I hope you found

00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,390
that helpful I encourage you to go forth

00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:24,970
and create if you're in Brisbane I very

00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:28,690
much encourage you to come along to one

00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:30,340
of our workshops and give it a go and

00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:35,350
that's it for me today and I'm very

00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:37,000
happy to talk to you for for the rest of

00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,250
the conference and if you have any

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,820
questions they're happy to take those

00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:49,109
thank you

00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:49,109
[Applause]

00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:09,170
thanks for the nice talk Chris I've had

00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:12,320
a question regarding the version in you

00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,060
you you have experienced there that you

00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,400
wanted to change things so you redo

00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:19,160
things you really you really change the

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,810
design what are common Falls that you

00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,940
you have done that you have learned so

00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:27,940
we don't do the same mistakes when you

00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,940
have you have done a mistake that is

00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,620
sorry and I was asking about the

00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,320
versioning when you do more than one

00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:41,000
version and what are common things that

00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:44,750
you have experienced that are typical

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:53,840
mistakes so we we may save doing those

00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:59,360
mistakes the typical problems we ran

00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:01,700
into were we didn't quite choose the

00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,810
right component we maybe there might

00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,120
have been a couple of versions of the

00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:08,150
component with with different pins so

00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:12,020
it's good to take your you've designed a

00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,700
circuit board you produced a design very

00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,410
very worthwhile thing to do is to print

00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,940
it out on a laser printer or whatever

00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:19,580
and get all the parts that you're going

00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,800
to put on there and just place them

00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,210
where they're going to go which gives

00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,680
you the chance to realize oh wait I got

00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,120
that one backwards or there's two

00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,890
versions of that and one goes this one

00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:33,440
goes that way and I'm using is the wrong

00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:36,320
one the other kind of problems we ran

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,910
into were we missed connecting a wire

00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:42,500
that NDB connected me to there and

00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:43,670
there's not a lot you can do to help

00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,380
that some of the some of the more

00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,760
expensive tools will actually simulate

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,830
your circuit for you and tell you yes

00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,480
this is going to work there are some

00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,670
great JavaScript tools for beginning

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,710
people and electronics that will give

00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,840
you simple stuff like I want to use a

00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,180
transistor to turn on a motor and you

00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:01,190
can design that circuit in the web

00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,590
browser and it will tell you if it's

00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,880
going to work in terms of how many how

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,920
many milliamps are going to flow to the

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:12,050
motor and is this transistor going to

00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:14,680
what you think it's going to do so as a

00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,730
beginner in electronics

00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,030
there are some really helpful tools

00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:22,400
there and I've linked to some of those

00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:25,370
in the in the slide deck

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,170
I will I've just thought of a few more I

00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:32,560
can throw on there as well so I'll do

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:32,560
that anyone else

00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:53,110
what's what's the smallest run of

00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:54,790
circuit boards that you can ask for at

00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,740
one of these places without paying

00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,390
through the nose for it the standard

00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,760
package from the manufacturer that I use

00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:04,630
is 10 boards they will do five it won't

00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,980
cost very much less so I've done I think

00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,710
the smallest order I've done is five of

00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:12,870
something we made we made ten of those

00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,870
big led wind speed display boards and

00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,510
the client haunted eight so we we

00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,850
ordered 10 boards thinking that would be

00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:26,590
plenty we stuffed up three of them so we

00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:29,260
ran out in terms of soldering things on

00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:31,180
and then not quite getting it right and

00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:34,510
deciding to try and D solder it and then

00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:39,520
damaging the copper in the process so we

00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:43,030
got five more so yeah the sweet spot is

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,980
ten boards the volume discounts get

00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:49,420
quite good so those those little LED

00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:51,600
sequence for ten of them that was going

00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:55,390
to turn out something like a dollar each

00:46:51,600 --> 00:47:00,880
actually sorry $0.50 each ten boards

00:46:55,390 --> 00:47:02,380
four or five bucks and so I looked at

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,000
looked at the volume pricing and went

00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,640
hey how much 100 cost me how much with

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,750
two hundred five hundred and once I got

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,730
to five hundred I was paying about

00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,460
twenty cents a board so it was about a

00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:14,680
hundred Australian dollars for five

00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,510
hundred of those those little sequins

00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,190
and beyond that I didn't see the price

00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:20,950
gap the unit price going down very much

00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:26,680
so I I ordered walked in on a box

00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:27,790
ordered five hundred of them you

00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,830
mentioned that you're gonna put your

00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:31,180
slides online so can you share with

00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,280
everybody because I think there's a lot

00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,200
of us or like we really want to go back

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,110
through some of those links and detail

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,880
and have a sort of slow longer a slower

00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:43,330
think about it and can you share with us

00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,600
a URL to your website or how we can yeah

00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,600
there we go

00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,760
so you'll find for example the the

00:47:52,030 --> 00:48:08,079
person you know I did last year about

00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:12,280
3d printing and laser cutting and when

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:14,859
when you are prototyping I guess you

00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,890
don't want to ask five copies of

00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:20,589
something right so what was the best way

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:22,720
to go when you have an idea you want to

00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:24,760
be make one PCB to see if it works and

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,859
then you will maybe make more copies

00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,720
is there any way like maybe making three

00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:38,619
different versions and sending them to

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:39,849
the brain if you if you just want to

00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:41,470
make one of something that the

00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:43,060
traditional wise have been to do the

00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:45,520
high matching with the with the acid to

00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:48,490
do the milling with the computer but we

00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,710
find that is actually cheaper and

00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,270
quicker and less hassle to just order 10

00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,180
in the boards and I we gotta write and

00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,609
throw throw them out if it didn't the

00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,500
other possibility is that you you you

00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:01,240
you batch them together you maybe you've

00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:07,089
got some other projects maybe you've got

00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:08,890
a you've got a hackerspace where there's

00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:10,960
other people working on projects is is

00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:13,869
put two or three designs together into a

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,400
single unit send that off and get it all

00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:18,940
done the other the other good tip is

00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,740
that the particular service are used

00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:24,040
which is called PCB way the links in the

00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:25,660
slides if you put an order in and will

00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,040
sit there in the cart

00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,020
and if it hasn't shipped yet and you're

00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,849
going to do another order you can simply

00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:34,030
sit ask them to combine the shipping on

00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:36,280
your existing water so particular with

00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:43,630
the but the starboard I had an order in

00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:45,339
for something that was that was a client

00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:47,050
project I got to the point where I

00:49:45,339 --> 00:49:48,970
needed to just send this off for the

00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,190
meet up and I simply piggyback the

00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,700
shipping on to that existing order so it

00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,710
didn't cost me anything extra

00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:59,319
sent the order in five bucks ten boards

00:49:54,710 --> 00:50:01,780

00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:04,730
in a situation where you've got

00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:06,710
collaborators you've got people at a

00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:08,030

absolutely talk to your local makerspace

00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:34,490
if you have one I also operate a small

00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:38,630
incubator space where people can come in

00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:40,220
and use their tools and expertise and I

00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,869
know there's there's there's maker

00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,599
