For Christmas 2018 I made an IoT-enabled LED star for our Christmas tree. 
I designed it in an afternoon and had the circuit boards in my hands 5 days later, for a cost of $5.00 for ten.

Learn how to get the most out of PCB design tools and PCB manufacture services to let your electronic circuits become a feature of your art.

A circuit board doesn't have to be green, and it doesn't have to be rectangular.  You can make your circuit part of your art by varying
  * the shape of the board itself, or
  * including artistic elements in the silk-screen overlay, or even
  * make your copper tracks an artwork of their own

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
