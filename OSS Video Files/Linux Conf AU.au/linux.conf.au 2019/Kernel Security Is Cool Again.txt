Why is Linux kernel security getting so much attention all of a sudden, and where is it going? What is the Linux Hardening Project about? What are the Landlock, SARA and WhiteEgret security modules for? This can't be all about side channel attacks, can it? Is security a good place to contribute? Casey Schaufler, who has been working in kernels and security for a very long time, will talk about the current state of Linux kernel security development. The efforts to make the kernel less susceptible to attack will be outlined. New developments in access controls will be described. Infrastructure changes, including expanded security module stacking, will be covered. You'll hear about integrity, TPMs, trusted boot and more. The talk will wrap up with predictions and some areas that aren't getting the attention they may deserve.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
