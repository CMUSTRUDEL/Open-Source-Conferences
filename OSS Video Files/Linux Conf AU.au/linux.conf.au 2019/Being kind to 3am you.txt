For engineers who participate in on-call rotations, documentation is critical to resolving issues. Especially when, at 3am, the responding engineer will be -- initially -- on their own, and not performing at their peak. 

In this short presentation, Katie will discuss some strategies she's implemented as a veteran on-call Site Reliability Engineer, and shows you how to be kind to 3am you.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

rival take it away AVT more good yep

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:16,830
great

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:19,260
I like sleep no really getting a good

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,380
night's sleep is just the best I mean I

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,480
wake up when my body is done I get some

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,330
coffee I know that my batteries are

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,369
charged to 100% and I can get going and

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,279
be productive with my day I can get up

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,930
get some exercise start work and I know

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,300
that I'm going to be operating it the

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,950
best that I can be and what I'm

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,379
productive and happy I get things done

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:46,050
and that's great but when I'm tired I

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:49,469
don't operate well when I'm tired I'm

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,649
unable to focus I can't physically see

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,039
things properly and it really inhibits

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,230
my ability to be productive so when I

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,340
get paged in the middle of the night as

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,700
an Operations engineer I'm tired I am

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,549
NOT going to be operating at my best and

00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,900
if I'm getting paged at 3:00 a.m. stuff

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:15,509
be broken yo I need to get it fixed so

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,600
what I need to do is to set myself up so

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,780
I can be the best I can be when the

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,170
pager inevitable inevitably will go off

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,060
at 3:00 a.m. because a 3:00 a.m. pager

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,640
as an Operations engineer will probably

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,070
happen I mean you can be lucky enough to

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,590
have a proper on-call rotation follow

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,240
the Sun if you have that good for you

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,340
I've never had that but this may not be

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,920
an actual 3:00 a.m. pager a lot of these

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,920
tips you can apply if you're sick if

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,710
you're having to multitask these are

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,329
just things to be kind to yourself and

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,640
if we have time at the end these are all

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,530
from my experiences if we have time at

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,060
the end we can open up the floor and you

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,159
can share your experiences but these are

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,630
my experiences I am an operations

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,720
engineer I'm not your operations

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,950
engineer so because this is a talk it

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,660
has to have sections and there's going

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,640
to be three of these I'm going to cover

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,390
essentials next

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,040
steps and feedback so essential

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,770
documentation you should really write

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,780
stuff down I hear it's really useful

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,209
keeping stuff in your head is bad

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,830
because other people are going to keep

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,060
stuff in their head and when it's 3:00

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,490
a.m. their heads are not going to be

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,459
available so having stuff written down

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,010
as good but where to have that written

00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,850
down is absolutely critical

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,130
you could go whole hog and create a full

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,140
knowledge database and documentation

00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,620
management system but that requires

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,110
buy-in and resources and management

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,840
approval and sometimes you just can't

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,780
get that the page is going to keep going

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,030
off and it'll take how long to get one

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,160
of these systems in place what you need

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,890
is somewhere where you can just throw

00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,900
notes down and I'm talking if you're in

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,880
a smaller team here if you're in a

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,700
bigger team with follow-the-sun and have

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,260
resources good for you you continue

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,870
doing that thing I hope you never have

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,200
to be on call at 3:00 and again I'm not

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,019
so lucky

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,760
places that you get to throw notes down

00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:25,130
you can throw notes in a wiki on your

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,829
github or under your username in your

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,870
confluence page or something but where

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,940
you start documenting things that you

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,040
might want to need at 3:00 a.m. is

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,680
really important and it has to have

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,989
features you have to have somewhere that

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,380
you can document that's editable I mean

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:45,290
well yes duh but this is really

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,260
important because at 3 a.m. you're going

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,200
to be wanting something that is there

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,799
that has your entire tool chest that you

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,890
can just pick up throw in edit what have

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,930
you so if you have your documentation in

00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,720
a repo that has to have PRS and have to

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,160
be approved that's not going to work too

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,540
well it's not going to scale you're

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,510
going to want to have something that you

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,920
can edit at any time you're also going

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,620
to want to have something searchable

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,290
because 3 a.m. I keep on saying 3 am

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,950
such a good term because 3 a.m. just has

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,410
that fear instilled into it at 3 a.m.

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,000
you're not going to be able to find that

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,870
notebook that's sitting on your office

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,449
desk with the keywords that you need

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:31,540
need to search whatever documentation it

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:34,169
is to find what you're looking for this

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,490
is really important when you're say

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:38,410
doing pager from the conference um

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,750
you're gonna need something that you can

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,690
search at any time of day no matter

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,699
where you are in the world what's really

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,210
super useful is if you have one of these

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,250
searchable indexes like confluence in a

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,290
search browser you can have a custom

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,280
search engine and you can start having

00:04:53,290 --> 00:05:00,150
keywords so I can go wiki keywords and

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,889
it will search my confluence or my

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,600
github wiki and that's super useful for

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:10,090
me because it means that I can start

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:13,300
having sort of a process where I go ctrl

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,520
T new tab type blah and if I do that

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,010
enough I start automatically doing that

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,229
at 3:00 a.m. and that kind of muscle

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:28,479
memory is something that still works at

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:29,830
3:00 a.m. I found probably wherever

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,710
you're going to be storing this probably

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:36,240
should be behind a company firewall just

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:39,190
saying I mean

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,720
Rorie's keynote from this morning yes

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,050
having all that documentation is really

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:48,010
great pretty sure his AWS keys aren't on

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,990
that repo but it needs to be

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,610
discoverable as well especially by your

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,930
co-workers because if you've been

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,270
creating a case having that case

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,250
discoverable by the other person on your

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,690
on-call rotation hopefully you have

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,610
somebody else on your own court rotation

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,650
but if you have someone else on there

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:10,060
they should be able to find your stuff

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:13,330
and possibly collaborate but the

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,250
question is what do you write down what

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,310
do you want to be able to discover at

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,710
3:00 a.m. that's going to depend on your

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,580
environment are you a doctor shop do you

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,680
do kubernetes

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,840
is there a lot of network appliances

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,419
happening what's going to be super

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,960
useful for you when you're half awake

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,520
and you need something that can search

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,130
through the current stopped docker

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,580
containers because you have a full disk

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:42,430
somewhere on an easy-to instance those

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,080
actions that are going to be hard to

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,940
compile from first principles in your

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:52,890
CLI at whatever am things that aren't

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:57,610
useful to be aliased also things that

00:06:52,890 --> 00:07:00,670
you want to have accessible your nights

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,250
cleaver and your nice chisel as an

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,500
analogy having these as copy paste of

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,450
all commands that are really simple to

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,280
use as part of your debugging processes

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:13,960
is so helpful and you also want to make

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,520
sure that whatever tools that you have

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:22,510
in this little wonderful bucket

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:26,380
repository aren't dangerous because

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,940
having just something simple as having a

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,290
environment variable that has to be

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,810
declared before you can run your command

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,030
may not work and you may sit there at

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,490
4:30 in the morning going why isn't

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,520
finding any docker containers oh right I

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,230
haven't declared what region I'm in

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,450
versus if you have a nice little cache

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,760
which has all these pipe commands at the

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:49,060
end and then you don't see that there's

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:54,190
an X arms delete at the end of your

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:58,000
pipeline or there's a DD copy to sta

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,500
that you don't know what it does and you

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,440
try running it and you break your entire

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:07,690
laptop these are all based on real

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:09,400
experiences but the tools that you have

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,840
it's going to depend on your environment

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,670
I'm an Operations engineer I'm not your

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,170
operations engineer but these are the

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,000
kind of things that hopefully is get you

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,610
start thinking about what kind of things

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,210
would be useful to you and don't run

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:26,890
with scissors because you know Stan um

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,080
so now that you've started thinking

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,780
about the initial basics what to put

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,000
where to put it you need to start

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,050
thinking about stepping up this case

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,880
your repository at this point in my head

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:43,240
I've done this many times now I have a

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,070
great big long confluence page separated

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,750
into sections I've got ansible things

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:51,270
I've got puppet things I've got whatever

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:54,420
else how can I use this and share

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:58,649
and make it integrated into my rotation

00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,959
system because integration is so so

00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,040
useful you've got different levels of

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,760
integration here

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,070
but having something like having moving

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,010
a page from my personal confluence into

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,279
an SRE section and having that linked on

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,160
the top of the firehose channel in slack

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,040
that could be really useful having it

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,959
turn up when you get notifications that

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,450
you're about to be on-call that could be

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,279
useful it depends on your system but

00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,410
having it available and visible

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,420
especially when you're not the person

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,300
that created it you can discover these

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,670
things and it's useful another big bonus

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,820
is not just linking to your giant cage

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,230
but having it contextual one fleet I

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,430
maintained had a bunch of different

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,230
machines across different operating

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,830
systems and different virtualization

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,110
types

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,260
there were Colo boxes there were raid

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,600
servers there was VMware KVM Xen who

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,060
Linux windows all the different versions

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,640
in between depending on the server and

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,339
the service that was exploding it would

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,550
be really useful to have contextual

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,490
information there and we were really

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,410
lucky because we had Nagios and we were

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,720
able to customize it so when a specific

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,610
alert turned up there was a little link

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,190
that would link back to our Moin Moin

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,600
wiki and depending on what service it

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,480
was it would link to the most

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,940
contextually important information for

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,279
that service if it was a specific server

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,730
it would show hey this is a special

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,020
server if it was a service so say CPU on

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,760
a Windows machine here's a whole bunch

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,860
of stuff here's task manager have you

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,209
heard of it those kind of things are

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,980
super simple and so good to set up so

00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,649
when it's just like oh it's an alert

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,029
what documentation at 3:00 a.m. you're

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,779
not working at your best so having a

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:51,570
nice little hey like Clippy turning up

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:53,610
at 3:00 a.m. so good um which brings me

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,959
to another important point a lot of this

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,600
stuff is going to be

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,020
choose-your-own-adventure based on what

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,470
encounters you have and making sure that

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,920
you loop back when you have issues and

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,750
making sure

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,029
that you update your documentation after

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,980
events occur is the only way that you're

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,019
going to evolve this documentation cache

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,360
it could be something as simple as

00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:19,790
storing the sanitized version of your

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,529
bash history into your base cache or

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,180
making sure that the senior s re that

00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:27,300
handled the alert documents how they

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,930
fixed it that hasn't happened to me

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,940
before yes because that's how juniors

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,810
learn and it's that feedback loop that

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,630
returns

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,959
junior engineers into senior engineers

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,279
these cases don't appear overnight

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,639
senior engineers don't grow on trees

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,920
they evolve from juniors and making sure

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,440
that we have this recurring feedback

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,730
loop of learning and teaching is how you

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,209
end up evolving a exceptionally strong

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,100
team of engineers having a cache of

00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,930
flags that's just a copy from a readme

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,360
of the CLI isn't going to help

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,820
having useful things where you can point

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,730
out that oh this server on this day the

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,829
month happens to have this issue that is

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,920
super useful especially when you can't

00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:16,560
actually fix it but the recurring issues

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,610
these are the things that you start

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,190
having a cache of because a lot of

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,640
places don't have follow-the-sun a lot

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:29,579
of places deal with customer service and

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,230
a lot of times you can't fix the root

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,440
issue so you need to know the most

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,769
efficient and effective way to fix it

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,380
because anyone knows who's been doing

00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:44,730
ops or engineering for amount of time

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:46,560
there's an xkcd wonderful thing that

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:51,060
says how long will it take to automate

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:54,660
and how much time will I save and if you

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:58,069
end up with a copy-paste able reboot all

00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:02,069
the server's script as opposed to

00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:05,459
creating an entire fresh spin up green

00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:07,199
blue infrastructure your restart script

00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,060
is going to be useful and it's going to

00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,319
save you time and it's going to make

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,050
sure you go back to sleep

00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:15,779
green blue if you can get the buy-in to

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,970
do it great do that fix your

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,289
infrastructure but until

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,729
then having something that's going to

00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:23,129
make sure you can get back to sleep is

00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:25,949
great and it may not be a copy/paste

00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,720
script you may work out that maybe you

00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:30,149
want to have log rotation to fix that

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,369
disk space thing that's happening every

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:37,859
day or have a scheduled task instead or

00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:39,479
have something that checks every once in

00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,149
a while whether something's broken and

00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:43,979
automatically fixing it

00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:46,109
the engineering time it takes to create

00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:48,419
these solutions versus how much time it

00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:49,769
saves the on-call engineer it's always

00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,929
going to be a balance it's always going

00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:54,269
to depend on your environment but having

00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:56,669
the documentation when issues happen and

00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:59,189
then evolving that documentation to work

00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,799
out workarounds and then evolving that

00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:06,829
into fixes this is how things get better

00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:08,999
and applying these automations into your

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:12,059
infrastructure scripts would also be

00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:14,249
super useful like adding it into an

00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,679
ansible playbook that you can just click

00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:18,449
or integrating it into your setup

00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,299
scripts to make sure that you have log

00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:24,479
rotation deployed on servers because if

00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:27,409
you don't you may miss it taking your

00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:30,269
bag of tricks and turning them into

00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:32,329
solutions it's just one way you can make

00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:35,339
sure your infrastructure gets better and

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:38,249
in all of this as I've said before it's

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:41,659
all about learning because you're going

00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:44,609
to learn how your environment operates

00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:46,649
but you're learning it your other uncle

00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:49,739
engineers may not be your juniors may

00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:52,559
not be so teaching them what's going on

00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:54,720
is super useful especially when they

00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,339
start getting the pager being able to

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,899
learn the weather of your environment

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:02,519
makes it so easy if maybe moves it from

00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,220
a part of your brain that actually works

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,789
at 3:00 a.m. I found when it starts

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,529
making sense so you're not stressing out

00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:14,759
makes sure that you can operate at the

00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:19,079
best of your ability and again the whole

00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:22,529
will fix it soon thing nothing gets

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,169
fixed overnight sure you can learn about

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:27,209
communities at linux contest rally but

00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:29,100
you're not going to have kubernetes spun

00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:31,379
up in your organization next Tuesday

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,630
until then you have to keep the old

00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:34,920
stuff running

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,949
but once you finally do get that

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,320
kubernetes set up making sure that you

00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:42,660
actually update your documentation to

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,240
make sure that oh this command isn't

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,130
going to work anymore that is super

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,959
useful this documentation case is going

00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,490
to be ever-evolving which is why it

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,459
needs to be editable and searchable and

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,630
discoverable etc etc and making sure

00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,399
that when you finally get those

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,829
infrastructure changes in place that you

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,930
can delete the old documentation that's

00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:03,269
no longer relevant making sure that is

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:06,329
communicated across your team that

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:08,490
hasn't happened before bonus points if

00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:10,740
you're on a distributed team actually

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,990
taking the time to make sure that

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:17,759
there's a physical handover that is

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:19,889
super useful as well and as a small side

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,069
note here because I might actually be on

00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:26,610
time this is great and showing empathy

00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:29,100
for your fellow engineer is really

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,470
really useful because they then show

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,600
empathy to you and they will actively

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,660
make sure that you get a full night's

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,100
sleep they may actually start doing

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,040
things like if they're doing

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,600
infrastructure changes taking the pager

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,089
that way if something explodes you don't

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,019
get woken up and it's that feedback loop

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:51,269
of making sure that people are thinking

00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,100
of each other and not just thinking of

00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:54,510
oh I want to replace this with this cool

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,620
thing no I want to make sure that katie

00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:01,410
gets sleep because the less pages and

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,970
alerts that happen the more everyone

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,459
gets a good night's sleep and they're

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:09,209
productive and they're useful the next

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,949
day because working on a team is hard if

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,860
you're already doing on-call

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:17,130
you're working out of hours and that's

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:18,959
tough but practicing explicit empathy

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,319
makes sure that it's easier for everyone

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,199
involved so you're not your best when

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,480
you're tired and you're doing yourself a

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,970
you're doing your future self a really

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,480
huge favor by starting on that bag of

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,460
tricks and then evolving from there and

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,409
I have a few minutes left so I would

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,380
love to open the floor for a little bit

00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:43,020
of open discussion about things that

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,390
maybe you've experienced in your own

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,100
core or in your operations

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,650
that I may not have covered because my

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,650
experiences of my own I would love that

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:57,420
if anyone had any thoughts comments I'm

00:17:52,650 --> 00:18:01,220
explicitly allowing comments my gosh sir

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:04,470
we have a runner who's also an organizer

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,440
please tell me about your experiences my

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:11,820
experience was running a an IT company

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,260
servicing SMEs and I would if the pager

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,059
went off in the middle of the night

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,710
whoever was holding the pager got a

00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,710
hundred bucks on their desk each morning

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,160
the benefit of the recording that was

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,160
pager duty sucks

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:45,570
bearing in mind I charged the client 150

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:47,220
if they dialed the page I don't actually

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,710
a question per se but I'd like the rest

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,630
of my team who aren't here to be able to

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,280
hear your presentation which I thought

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,140
was excellent you know it's really good

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,270
they recording it yeah how do you get

00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,080
access to those it'll be on the YouTube

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,940
channel youtube.com/ Linux compared you

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,620
whatever year it is and probably about

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,299
this time tomorrow they'll stop going up

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,130
from today brilliant thank you very much

00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:14,400
no worries that was one over here as

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:17,220
well so outside of sis admitting I also

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,230
volunteer with my local fire department

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,809
and so it's been interesting to learn

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,760
from them the strategies that they have

00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,580
for being functional when the pager goes

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,770
off at 2:00 3:00 4:00 in the morning and

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,559
it might be life or death or something's

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,910
literally on fire and a couple of the

00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,940
things that I've picked up from them

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:39,660
that really help are labeling everything

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,120
and what you said about the putting the

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,630
link in the page when appropriate or in

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,100
the alert that you get just seems really

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,679
an ingenious way of bringing that back

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,890
to tech to me and the other thing is to

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,400
do it in the daylight whenever you can

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:58,800
to practice what will I do if and when

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,560
this happens in the middle of the night

00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,800
and as a junior more junior sis admin I

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,930
like seeking mentorship from my more

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,280
senior people saying okay what are the

00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,380
ways in which you've seen this break

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,850
before what's the best way to attack it

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,370
and the best way to troubleshoot it and

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,400
explicitly having those conversations is

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:20,100
a way of doing a dry run when you are

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,260
conscious so that you recognize it you

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,360
don't feel quite so lost when you're

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,700
when it's the middle of the night and

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,630
there are so many other talks about this

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,550
kind of stuff

00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,460
most of what I said is based on my own

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,740
experiences but there is Andrew Godwin

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,710
talking about lessons from aviation

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,780
there's also Danielle epic owner who's

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,500
done wine on documentation quadrants

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:45,240
there's also there's so many more good

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,110
resources but hopefully I was able to

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:53,070
show some practical and next Monday tips

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,450
which is something that a lot of things

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,340
at these conferences they're like ooh

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,100
shiny ideas but I like things that I can

00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,030
actually implement sir how much more

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,650
time do I have just one more okay

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:07,590
probably reiterating but there's a

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,690
project called IP XE and every single

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,670
error message is also a link to their

00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:17,670
wiki page and I really really like that

00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:20,690
approach yes and then there might be one

00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:24,060
or more over here if we have time okay

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,670
your point about I think you had a slide

00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,280
saying run a retro sort of thing my

00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:32,430
favorite meetings at work after an

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,830
incident going into the post incident

00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,170
review those are by far the best

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,000
meetings we have a work where you sit

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,240
down you say what was the impact to our

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,910
users and you just break it down into

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,380
you know was there cultural things that

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,480
meant we didn't respond in the right way

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,800
at the time or how can we improve our

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,810
learning and monitoring of the things

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,790
and I think that's a really important

00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,490
part of a feedback loop and it's a

00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:59,640
really good opportunity to involve your

00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:02,400
developers and more junior engineers as

00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,810
well and other people who are otherwise

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,670
potentially interested or should be

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,440
interested in feature degrading the

00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,000
developers and the operations people is

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,020
really cool there there should be a name

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,130
for that

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,130
[Laughter]

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,670
upstairs yeah I think one more over

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:24,020
there if we have time

00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:26,030
no DevOps is a really good thing there's

00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,880
entire conferences on DevOps but yes

00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:31,100
thanks so much for the talk there is one

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,510
thing that now my developers own coal

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,850
they're the first ones who received

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,040
alerts and they just call us if it is an

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,840
infrastructure problem but one thing

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,970
that is pretty common knowledge for ops

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,420
and is not for developers it's just

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:47,390
right now every command every thought

00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:50,240
that he have during 3 a.m. outages and

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,520
the output of that command as well

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,200
because in the morning we hadn't no idea

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,060
because you would win sleep our way

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,550
through and sometimes you made a mistake

00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,070
a very small mistake because you were

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,960
sleeping but in the morning you can

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,550
actually catch you just document

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,310
everything is going to make the post

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:10,510
morning so much easier to understand

00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:17,710
docker status there's docker stats 1u

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:17,710
