Title: MIXED REALITY AND ART: THE QUEST FOR THE SHINY
Publication date: 2020-01-09
Playlist: linux.conf.au 2019
Description:

https://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/220/

Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are this year’s hottest buzzwords when it comes to art. Are they just gimmicks or is there something deeper behind the work? When artists can create whole immersive worlds or blur the line between the digital and the real what we have to say is still of the most importance. This talk is about the latest technologies and how to stay on track and not get (too) distracted by the shiny new other options out there! J Rosenbaum is a digital artist working in 3D Modeling and Augmented Reality with Machine Learning based interactions. Join us as they unpack what new technology brings to art and what artists bring to new technologies.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,819
and tick many Kampf so our next speaker

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,309
is Jay Rosenbaum and they are a

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,480
contemporary figurative artist working

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,969
in 2d modeling also traditional painting

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,570
with a great background and kind of

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,939
classical art as well and they have a

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,949
presentation today about mixed reality

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,010
and art the quest for the shiny so this

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,740
is not just really an exploration of

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,570
their own practice but also um I guess

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,210
providing a few kind of Henson and

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,760
gotchas and to how we all as artists can

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,040
make sense of this without really

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,660
getting caught up in the shiny so

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,489
without further ado I'm going to give it

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,489
over to Jay thanks so much mark

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,620
[Applause]

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,390
thank y'all so much so I'm an artist

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,280
working with new media and the latest

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,350
technologies it all began three years

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,840
ago during my master's of Contemporary

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,370
Art at the VCA where I worked to create

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,910
a series of works on non-binary

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,860
transness in a binary state or 3d models

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,860
human figures that defy gender binaries

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,659
with an exploration of transness through

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,360
an augmented reality application and

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,920
machine learning based interactions it's

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,890
really refreshing to be able to talk

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,570
about it like that I loved studying at

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,020
the VCA but it's not a technological

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,759
school I so I actually became a bit

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,220
adept at communicating all of these

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,350
technical aspects in non-technical ways

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,890
I talked about the ghost in the machine

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,860
and the dreams of computers I came into

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,020
the VCA as a painter with 3d as a tool

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,270
to help me paint and somewhere within

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,369
its non technologically hallowed halls I

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,630
became a purely a new media artist

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,360
working with some of the latest

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,250
technologies new media art doesn't

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,170
appear on a lot of people's radars and

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,810
when it does the technical parts have

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,270
often been out sourced to be successful

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,009
in new media art it seems you need loads

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,229
of money to be able to hire the Nerds

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,750
you need to produce the vision that you

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,030
have so we get an image of an artist as

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,450
a visionary but not an image of an

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,780
artist as a nerd except I'm a nerd I'm a

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,239
huge ridiculous proud nerd and I also

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,860
happen to be an artist and finally I

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,470
have comfortably merged that

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,510
within myself into a cohesive whole I

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,760
came into my master's degree as a

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,680
painter using 3d modeling to create the

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,210
life models I needed for reference to

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,360
get the lighting in the anatomy right

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,190
but I couldn't afford life models and it

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,810
turns out the real humans won't hover

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,700
for you upside down at 3:00 a.m. anyway

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,370
luckily open source and makes licensing

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,970
came to my rescue with blender make

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,130
human does 3d and Lux render all of

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,080
these are free platforms for 3d modeling

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,970
and development and rendering and

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,730
they've become increasingly powerful

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,100
over the years I first explored 3d

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,350
modeling via the make human project and

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,060
saw a way forward to create the figures

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,540
I saw in my head that I never seemed to

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,670
see in real life I could dial male and

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,800
female attributes together mix them tie

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,300
them in I never knew that my gender was

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,230
the reason for all of this I didn't

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,810
always flow it until much later but I

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,790
now I got to really really see all of

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,730
these things that I could see in my head

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,880
and feel how I wanted them to be I now

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,940
use the Genesis project by Daz 3d now

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,250
it's combined with sophisticated render

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,070
engines like Lux render to fully realize

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,830
my visions using Genesis I can work with

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,620
an androgynous model and mix and match

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,640
with any physical attributes I wish the

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,920
works are put through a deep neural

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,390
network to allow the computer to compare

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,549
the work to a reference image or

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,980
artifact and dream of its own

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,870
interpretation I've a little interpret I

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,850
have a sorry little interpretation I

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,070
have little influence in this output it

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,900
uses machine learning to create the

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,540
result and the reaction is still always

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,250
a surprise to me the reaction you see

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,870
through the augmented reality app on

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,350
your phone is the result of my

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,030
computer's artistic imagination my final

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,489
series of works for my masters were

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,110
photographic style prints of my final

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,170
renders and a collection of laser-cut

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,930
MDF our abstract pieces based on the

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,459
final results of the machine learning

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,410
inside the app each work would resolve

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,989
to a series of machine learning based

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,669
animations when I started

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,560
conceptualizing these augmented reality

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,410
works I despaired over the initial

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,630
courts I was given I'm a starving artist

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,390
I'm really not wealthy

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,600
and but so I looked around and there are

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,010
options for developing augmented reality

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,920
on your own if you're not afraid of a

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,300
little card it's seen this unusual in

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,310
the art world to do these things for

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,080
yourself you do the painting yourself

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,930
unless you're above that pay grade like

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,550
Damien Hirst but the backend programming

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,380
it's totally different but is it really

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,270
it's 3d modeling on a computer that

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,330
different to clay modeling or rendering

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,500
that different to photography is

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,840
programming that different to writing

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,020
it's a different a different language or

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,900
several usually but in the end it's

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,420
another medium to explore another

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,610
technique to conquer and with Stack

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,680
Overflow and github and unity

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,980
there are amazing resources out there to

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,410
help anyone even artists because the

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,360
future of art really is new media this

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,020
has been said since the 80s but the art

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,000
world moves really slowly I've seen that

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,670
idea catching up now with the shiny new

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,350
technologies available to us like mixed

00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,390
reality and machine learning by start

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,850
with the idea that we can blur the lines

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,970
between the real and the digital and we

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,010
can create new worlds out of thin air

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,530
and now we're starting to see more and

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,710
more amazing works made with machine

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,660
learning and mixed reality and I'm

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,730
astounded because I'm still barely

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,530
scratching the surface but here I am

00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,630
three years in creating artwork using

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,450
augmented reality style transfers

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,220
semantic photographic transfers texture

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,740
synthesis and generative adversarial

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,740
networks I'm working on generating

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,240
stories using image classifiers and text

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,420
generation and working collaboratively

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:14,060
with my computer as an artist and a

00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,060
programmer sorry

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,389
there's something so delightful about

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,400
looking people who are looking through

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,539
their phones at my figures who are

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,910
looking at their phones

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,710
it's a beautiful recursion of technology

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,990
and engagement a new way of looking at

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,300
the world so often we see all this

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,030
commentary about complaining about the

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,830
pervasiveness of smartphones and without

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,080
exploring the very beautiful ways that

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,370
connects us all together without

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,650
acknowledging the fact that we have the

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,310
sum total of humanities knowledge at our

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:54,039
fingertips there are always people

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,080
griping about selfies and narcissism

00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:59,410
without exploring the very real ways

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,320
that selfies have making us feel valid

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,669
in our own skin especially when we can't

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,930
always control the way the world sees us

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,639
much of my work has been on the nature

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,740
of non-binary transness in a binary

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,690
state as so many of us live as

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,820
non-binary people on a gender spectrum

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,190
in a world that insists on being blue or

00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,539
pink male or female I felt it was

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,820
appropriate to explore this nature

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:25,479
within a system that sees things

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,699
essentially is on or off 1 or 0 my work

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,680
represents those of us who live on in

00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,810
that spectrum outside the binary and

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,729
often have difficulty fitting into the

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,580
rigid societal norm so often enforced

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:39,190
upon us my work also explores the nature

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,229
of passing and not passing as the gender

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,000
you are the complex nature of your

00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,250
internal monologue not matching your

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,979
exterior and how if you're an agenda

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,080
that changes regularly your body may or

00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:52,930
may not fit you at any time sometimes

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,409
without warning the trapped in the wrong

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,639
body narrative still persists the

00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,289
narrative of trans people wanting to

00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,479
change their bodies is pervasive and

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,180
trans people who cannot or do not wish

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,650
to transition are underrepresented

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,560
there's a sense that we're less valid

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,349
somehow for if we choose not to

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,909
transition for whatever reason I can't

00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:15,970
speak for all the different varieties of

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:18,490
transness but I can say that there's a

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,199
lack of visibility for trans people who

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,110
do not fit the mold of wanting to change

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,080
themselves this project shows people in

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,150
varying stages of self-acceptance of

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,419
exploring their bodies as though they

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,340
are unashamed their gods inspired by

00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:35,500
archaeological artifacts and classic

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,810
with a modern twist they're a vision of

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,990
acceptance and emergence showing that

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,760
there's no wrong way to have a body I'm

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,100
drawn to the notion that my figures

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,020
exist in a world of their own that they

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,620
have a digital life in a digital world

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,540
where digital and real meld together to

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,040
create something more than we are now

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,650
and these works are glimpse into that

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,900
future the machines will learn and grow

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,060
and pass the singularity and begin to

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,630
think on their own and humans will grow

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,760
and change and merge alongside them

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,190
until we cross a digital frontier and at

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,900
all merges with our own where binaries

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,300
no longer matter and nothing counts

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:21,280
beyond the mind and thought and

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:24,880
creativity when I started working on

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,340
this for my Master's my supervisor asked

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,290
the question where does the work lie in

00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,540
a digital artwork when does it become

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,420
real and I've pondered that question

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,400
constantly I come from a traditional

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,570
painting background and my 3d modelling

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,430
has gone from being my reference

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,650
material to being at the forefront of my

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,630
creative practice in painting the

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,090
questions simple the work is real when

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,430
you paint it and you hang it up but for

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,260
a digital work is it real when it's in

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,690
the computer is it real when it's

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,900
printed the capabilities of new media

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,460
are so much greater than painting an

00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,530
aesthetic painting or a sculpture and we

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,270
need to be able to address this to move

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,320
beyond the traditional notions of white

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:07,570
of art in a white-walled space to going

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,320
so much further than that this is my

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,540
attempt to move beyond that notion where

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,150
I feel like the figures been nailed like

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,610
a lifeless butterfly on the wall to a

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,350
different space altogether allowing the

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,220
viewer to enter their world if only a

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,410
little augmented reality is my answer if

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,150
we can look to the physical work on the

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,700
wall to the work on the screen and see

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:34,120
it come to life inside our ferns we can

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,460
see it exists in a 3d plane in a digital

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,140
world of its own a world where we're

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,910
starting to be able to teach computers

00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,710
how to think and create art for

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,580
themselves with minimal assistance from

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,870
a human it was important to me that

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,210
these works look just so

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,010
was little human involvement from the

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,990
digital print to the computer guided

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,730
laser cutting to the deep neural network

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,250
based code that produced the abstracted

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,990
results the machine learning response is

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,570
a way to show transitioning without

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:05,350
transitioning and an internal spectrum

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,300
rather than a physical one my process

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,880
has been refined and distilled as any

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,130
artist does I find inspiration by

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,150
looking at cultures and classic artworks

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,190
and archaeological artifacts reading

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,650
myths and drawing up my ideas as I get

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,570
them I draw inspiration from selfies and

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,980
from selfie culture and the notion of

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:28,690
turning that traditional male gaze

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,980
inward to making that gaze back I take

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,110
some of the original concepts and I

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,230
shift them alter the gender expression

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,330
in different ways often very subtle the

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,790
pose may be enhanced or changed in my

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,680
mind the angle may change the works are

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,770
informed by the inspiration but not

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,920
exactly necessarily mimicking in this

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,930
example I have a memento mori' pace by

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,270
Cambiaso that I reinterpreted from my

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,700
earn series the skull became the phone

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,920
and the figures pose became a slightly

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,020
twisted to produce a more masculine air

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,940
so we end up with a very different work

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:05,980
for one that references the original

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:08,020
inspiration a grey lifeless androgynous

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,350
shape stares at me from within my screen

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,240
I granted life i granted primary and

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,910
secondary gender characteristics I give

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,610
it skin the gender characteristics do

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,380
not matter the skin is just skin the

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,610
genitals of the person her skin was

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,400
scanned is irrelevant

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,180
it's just disembodied no and it belongs

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,490
to my figure

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,170
I moved from being the sculptor to the

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,770
puppeteer and lovingly helped them into

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,540
position

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,420
I provide everything they need in their

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,930
world a foreign a stage a backdrop some

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,420
lighting

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,940
I dropped piece after piece of fabric to

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,800
get the physics right and create create

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,950
the right angle the proper level of wind

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,080
and gravity to get that perfect effect

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,660
that I need and then I shift once more

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,250
to photographer I light my virtual stage

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,030
and craft the key lights to create the

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:58,150
best results the camera in this case is

00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,950
a rendering engine called Lux Lux is a

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,250
physically based rendering j'en that

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,140
takes

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,670
everything in the scene and calculates

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,000
how the light would affect each and

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,710
every surface just as if it were real

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,050
the light penetrates the skin just a

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,240
little bit in technical terms it's

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,740
called subsurface scattering but that's

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,470
a technical term for something that

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,200
infuses breath and blood into the bodies

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:24,340
however artificially it makes the skin

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,380
look supple nude skin is alive glowing

00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,300
the light catching the surface and

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,070
creating natural highlights like a

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,840
photographer I place everything

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,270
correctly apply my settings and just

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,680
hope for the best I create dozens of

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:39,820
renders waiting for that perfect shot

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,520
that one moment when it all works I know

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,160
it works when I feel the figure breathe

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,960
when I know they're alive somehow where

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,170
does the life emerge from within the

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,720
figure in the skin in the lighting the

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,760
figures are often expressionless but the

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,720
lighting gives them a stolid strength a

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,520
solidity a shift from sculptor to

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,160
photographer to program as a historian

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,760
and back again until I have the results

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,620
I'm after once I received the render I

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,630
like usually after hundreds of tiny

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,490
fabric pose and lighting tweaks it's

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,160
time to give it my ear into my computer

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,170
to dream its own interpretation I start

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,960
with the source inspiration the original

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,160
piece that informs the work and I put it

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,320
through a machine learning algorithm

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,660
called neural style this is a style

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,760
transfer algorithm programmed in Lua and

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,080
running on the torch framework that

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,780
takes the style of one image and

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,700
transposes it onto another I take my

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,320
render and my inspiration and into the

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,870
parameters I need and allow the

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,610
iterative process to run its course the

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,250
final result is sometimes a mess to

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,160
begin with but it's a jumping-off point

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,630
for further exploration it may be I need

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,580
to find the magic combination of

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,370
parameters and strength of transfer and

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,530
abstraction and other times I may need a

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,230
different style image sometimes I just

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,850
know the piece I want to use as my style

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,000
image and sometimes it's a lengthy quest

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,670
to find the perfect one if we return to

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,120
the Cambiaso image i use the painting as

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,680
the style the image in this case and it

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,170
created a very pleasing to your Oscar

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,089
our effect reminiscent of the original

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,860
work

00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,709
never say what the results are going to

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,089
be or what will work work best but as I

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,399
progressed in my machine learning

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,230
knowledge and research I'm improving all

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,220
the time in selecting the ideal

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:30,519
parameters and image styles to transfer

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,279
it took me 250 pages of experimentation

00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,740
and exploration to get the 14 animations

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,430
used in that first series of works but

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,259
it became easier each time I know this

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,259
because at my supervisors request I

00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,939
printed out the code and results

00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:49,360
complete with all of my notation swears

00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:50,949
and emoji somewhere along all of my

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,749
exploration into creating

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,569
computer-generated art using card

00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:57,399
I learned something I never successfully

00:15:55,569 --> 00:16:03,339
learned in programming class how to

00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:05,410
document my card and this is proof so

00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,509
helpful all of this research and

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,360
diligence has paid off as I've delved

00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,509
deeper into my programming and

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,370
development

00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:14,319
my earliest notes have been a burn to me

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,319
as I'm sure the ones I'm writing now

00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,449
will be to future me they've been notes

00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,509
to myself from the past to help my said

00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,529
to help me as I traverse this landscape

00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:26,170
frameworks simple issues in app

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:28,269
development everything gets recorded in

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,339
Evernote this helps me work through

00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:33,009
problems but also helps me when I face a

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:35,620
similar problem later on and there's

00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:38,679
something incredible to writing out the

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,329
card to fire it off you never not never

00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,819
quite know if it'll be a raging success

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:44,110
a complete disaster or if you missed a

00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:46,720
space or a comer and it's just gonna

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,959
fall over completely my first few

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,870
attempts were horrifying but that first

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,990
image when it came out that was a moment

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,579
it was created it's entirely by my

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,910
computer it didn't even matter that it

00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:03,730
was hideous it was a result it was a

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,730
momentous occasion brought forth by my

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,189
computer creating something new it took

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,390
two disparate works and United them to

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:13,870
create its own thing

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,819
and created an art-student I've no doubt

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,220
that we're seeing incredible things

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,529
coming from autonomously generated

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,720
computer aaj but right now I'm happy to

00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:25,949
be teaching an art student one that only

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,949
occasionally talks back

00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,330
the way the computer chooses to

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,789
interpret the work is a mystery the most

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,470
exciting moment for me is when the

00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,330
neural network adds a color that isn't

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:44,500
present in either the render by me or

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,570
the style image I used to make it to

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,610
define it the color blooms across the

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,890
surface in animation and that's the

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,720
moment I feel the presence of the ghost

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,750
in the machine the unexpected and

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,480
unpredicted outcome the deep purple here

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,600
is not present in I though the render by

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,100
me or the Greek vase I use for reference

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:09,460
it's an addition at it purely by the

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:12,220
computer I know it's probably a result

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,220
of a color aberration in adjacent pixels

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:19,059
that the computer just ran with but it

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,700
chose that color it decided to emphasize

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:24,220
it and that is when a piece becomes more

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,399
successful to me a splash of digital

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,960
purple in a Greek vase inspire to work

00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:31,990
that moment when I see a random color

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,240
bloom that's a moment I'm proud to be an

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,429
artist working in this field there's a

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,200
sense of rightness of working

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,750
collaboratively with my computer as an

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,640
artist when I received the machine

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,039
learning result I'm after I create

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,870
tighter iterations until I have a tidy

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,049
group of less than 20 that animates

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,120
smoothly at this point I've created the

00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:54,399
works that are going to make up the pace

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,220
but have yet to tie them together and

00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:59,140
that's where the unity comes in in

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,960
deciding to develop an augmented reality

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,360
app I test today our solutions for more

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,580
asthma lay our Wikitude and v4 eeeh

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,440
before eventually settling on you priori

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,600
for ease of use and full software

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,630
development kit options and the price

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,149
point didn't hurt either I knew I was

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,010
looking after looking at or asthma and

00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:21,220
layered that I really wanted to develop

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,980
the app myself to give it a unified

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:27,250
aesthetic at a reasonable price point

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,649
but I knew I wanted the ability to use

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,690
photographic images as my reaction image

00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,710
I wanted the ability to expand the app

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,169
as needed

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,390
both wicket udûn before it had the in

00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:40,210
features I was after but before I had

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,580
more options for expanding my app later

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,139
such as 3d object scanning which I still

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,139
have yet to use but I'm really excited

00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:48,700
about it it was important to me that the

00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:50,769
app be available to download on the

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,480
viewers own devices and for that I

00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:55,210
needed to be able to produce a full

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,389
release ready app for the App Store and

00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:02,019
Google Play on an extremely tight budget

00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:05,740
I relied heavily on this resource for

00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:08,649
all of my development news this was my

00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,990
very first mobile app and after reading

00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:13,749
all of the documentation on getting an

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,460
app approved and how the very last thing

00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:17,350
you should do is try to publish the very

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,600
first step you made for school I was

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,899
super prepared to publish my very first

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,850
app I made for school so i armed myself

00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:26,259
with a somewhat shaky understanding of

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,970
unity and an even shake your

00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,570
understanding of Xcode and Android

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:34,539
editor and I started building my app I

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:36,309
created a very minimal interface there's

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:39,610
nothing to distract from the artwork and

00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:41,700
imported the SDK with v4 eeeh you add

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,470
the images in their web interface first

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,779
then you download the data in a unity

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,100
package ready for import the images are

00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,100
encoded with that recognition

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,830
information ready to be put to use the

00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,720
ratings show how clear the images is the

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,090
target with the sharper with sharp

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,629
intersections being the strongest for

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,190
recognition purposes and it seems that

00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:05,499
all the horror stories I'd read were

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,149
perhaps a bit overblown my app was

00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:08,769
approved on both stores on the first

00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:13,119
attempt and you can download them now on

00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:15,850
Google Play and FL augmented reality is

00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,950
such a wonderful shiny bridge for

00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,450
digital artists looking to explore the

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,240
real in the digital and bring people

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,610
into digital art forms we live inside

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,549
our devices these days it's only to be

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:31,029
expected that our art embraces this and

00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:33,490
that our world is richer for it the

00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:35,320
ability to layer a virtual world on to

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:39,129
the real one and enhance our realities

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:42,190
in so many ways is so exciting and it's

00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:44,580
amazing way to add color and life to the

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,830
world around us and art to the everyday

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,919
it enables people to look further within

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,510
a piece to see and unlock other content

00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,400
that artists could only allude to before

00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:00,140
it adds further dimensionality to our

00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:02,720
work ar brings art to everyone around us

00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,700
everyone with a smartphone can access it

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,309
from their screens or in the wild people

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,890
can feel connected to it the

00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:12,919
interactivity of AR enabled work seems

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:15,350
to bring people together a conversation

00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,330
is started between the viewer and the

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,370
work and between the viewers themselves

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,570
they always talk about it even if

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,580
they've never met each other

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,400
I see conversations starting all the

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,320
time and it's wonderful art goes from

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,820
being the province of the few to being

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,980
more accessible I've moved from working

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,020
with purely image based targets with 2d

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,960
animations to adding in interactive 3d

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,120
sculptures that use unities in volts

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,130
level of detail rendering system to

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,130
alter the sculpture depending on the

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,049
viewers proximity these sculptures are

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,960
served from light boxes with laser-cut

00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:54,110
markers and appear lit from underneath

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,140
and they fracture and change as the

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,940
viewer moves closer or further this

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,130
invites comment on biological

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,690
essentialism and the need to focus in

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,030
and pick apart the bodies of trans

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,799
people often while ignoring the person

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:12,470
they are my next body of work was called

00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,179
unnatural an exploration of Nyad strides

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,549
and narrates from Greek and Roman

00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,679
mythology using technology to create

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:21,740
modern interpretations of classical

00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,049
creatures of nature using the highly

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,720
technological with the highly natural

00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:28,669
invites discussion about how at odds we

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,679
are to the natural world and how we

00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:32,600
might use technology to better connect

00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,559
with the environment and assist our

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,200
planet it need not be an either/or thing

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:41,929
but an opportunity to explore and evolve

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,600
within ourselves the anthropomorphize

00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:46,400
ation of environmental concerns assists

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,570
with the empathy towards the environment

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,820
and its needs many artificial

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,350
intelligence advocates believe that

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,880
artificial intelligence is the way

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,309
forward to helping our planet heal

00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,620
itself to making great strides in

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:03,620
cleaning the oceans and the air growing

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:06,770
more planets and pushing back the damage

00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,520
humans have done in this case it made

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,440
sense to me

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,380
to use a neural network trained on

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,540
nature create images for based on my

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,820
work by uniting this vision of the

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:20,750
future with a vision of the past I hope

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,309
to show a way forward this series relies

00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,200
much more heavily on artificial

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:26,120
intelligence based work with the

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,090
majority of the prints being based on an

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:33,020
algorithmic extract abstraction using

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:35,960
multi scale neural texture synthesis it

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:38,120
uses similar data to style transfers by

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,340
determining how often a color or effect

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,350
repeats and creates its own high

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:47,020
resolution texture from a small sample

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,020
it becomes a very convincing abstraction

00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:54,530
from here I started using the anime it

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,470
results with animations to create

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,270
animated iterative style transfers one

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,520
of the reasons I switched from torch to

00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,530
Lua a torch and Lua

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,929
to tensorflow and Python apart from

00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,940
stability is because this particular

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:11,960
version allows me to specify an

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,760
indifferent initial starting point and

00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,570
for the abstraction rather than style or

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,400
the content that way I can build on the

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:23,300
iterative static animations to create

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,700
animations to build in style and as they

00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,950
animate figures that emerge from their

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,780
print and their domains swirling in

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:34,040
leaves or bathed in dappled light

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,630
between branches I've also built on my

00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,710
interactive sculptures creating more

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,360
complex ones the figures that explode

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,000
into leaves or collapse into waves

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,590
shimmering in the app I've had to level

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,230
up my knowledge of physics in blender

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,000
quite substantially but it's been fun to

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,150
explore all of these new concepts and

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,520
shiny technologies in this way and I

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,830
find the while these works are not

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,390
explicitly about gender and trances I

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,760
can't escape it in my work

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,100
gender is inherent to everything I do

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,940
it's at my core and everything I make

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,530
expresses that I know my works are

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,230
always inherently queer because it's

00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,030
part of who I am I'm obsessed with the

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,980
potential for machine learning and

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,510
augmented reality in art for

00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,610
collaborating with computers and

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,020
handheld devices and headsets to add

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,090
layers on to this world

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,610
pixel by pixel to blur the line between

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:27,860
the real and the not real and explore

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,330
new concepts in a purse digital age but

00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,580
I always have to remember to keep my

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,110
eyes on the prize to not just keep

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,890
getting distracted by the next shiny

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:39,920
thing my next phase of research and

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,290
hitting into my PhD examines gender

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,360
through the lens of computer vision

00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:47,180
hidden worlds explores how computers see

00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:50,090
us we live in an age where identity can

00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,130
be simulated easily whereas believable

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:56,360
celebrities can be imagined hold by a

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:58,880
computer and faces can be stolen where

00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,160
our eyes can easily be tricked but what

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,970
about artistic modes of computer vision

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:07,250
and creation image classifiers give us

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,650
clues into computer modes of perception

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,050
but sometimes their solutions are

00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:15,200
mystifying I want to explore that space

00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:18,350
in-between where art and technology meet

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,080
I want to explore gender as its created

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,030
and perceived by computers and I want to

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,180
explore some of the most exciting areas

00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,010
of machine learning all those shiny new

00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,140
technologies that keep emerging and

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,660
getting me excited always keeping in

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:36,380
mind that question where's the art where

00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:38,260
is the work I began a series of works

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,480
with the shiniest of deep learning

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:44,930
technologies I generated red for serial

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,480
network again takes a data set of images

00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:50,060
and learns to make its own based on what

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,790
it sees the generator makes the work

00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:55,550
while a discriminated judges it based on

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:58,280
the source material as the discriminator

00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:00,410
passes some works and fails others the

00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,750
generator learns to make more works that

00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,300
pass the test in this case I was going

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,640
for an abstract feel the data set was

00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,830
small there was only 16 thousand images

00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,010
bidar to that of Greek and Roman

00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:16,190
statuary the nature of curation and

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,850
critique is a constant here the artist

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,280
curates

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,750
a data set of thousands of images to

00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,240
wherever the Commish aim to work with

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,250
the discriminator critiques the result I

00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,160
curate and critique the results that

00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:30,020
pass the discriminator and while

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,480
curating a data set I find myself

00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,880
slipping into a form of meditative state

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,740
I became the discriminator of this

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,080
series of photographs as I prepared them

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,640
I see the photographs and I cut the ones

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,350
that don't fit and I find myself

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,410
daydreaming of the results and what I

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,390
hope to see I know the generator and

00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:50,420
discriminator don't daydream but it's

00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:53,870
easy to imagine that they do the works

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,880
that come out a dreamlike undefined but

00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,190
gaining in definition and resolve as the

00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,690
machine learns you don't have much

00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,450
control of what the machine will

00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,880
generate past that it's an exercise in

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,820
letting go working with generative art

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,340
but the results in the end came close to

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,710
what I'd hoped to find I found myself

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,270
hoping for bodies missing limbs

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,360
reflecting the amount of work in

00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:18,740
statuary I saw and figures blending

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,020
gender characteristics

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,030
I wanted to create new an idealized

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,930
sculptures for those of us who never got

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:29,240
to see ourselves realized as gods once

00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:31,280
the data set was complete I started the

00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,620
weeks of training of the neural network

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,330
I'd load the images as they were

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,300
generated in the latent space of

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,950
training and watches at learned sifting

00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,840
through these images for once that

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:45,200
inspired me was another exercising

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,450
curation and I watched as the concept

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,070
evolved in my head I took some of my

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,680
favorites and I just started to draw

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:54,080
into them on my iPad just testing out

00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,570
ideas while I waited I knew what I

00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:01,070
wanted to say but not quite how I wanted

00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:03,710
to say it finally I started to watch as

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:06,200
the network collapsed it started to

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,390
create the same images over and over as

00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,580
the generator decided only one image

00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,250
would truly satisfy the discriminator

00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,260
the generated works were abstract as

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:18,470
expected but with recognizably human

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,540
shapes as the data set was extremly

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,970
idealized it was a delight to see

00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,550
exaggerated bodies and delightful curves

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:29,180
emerge works beyond what I'd hoped to

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:32,450
find I delighted in the textures and the

00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:34,850
shapes I saw emerging I selected my

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,930
favourites and made drawings of what I

00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,120
saw in the works

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,790
the figures emerging within the abstract

00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,530
forms from those drawings I made 3d

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:45,070
models and from those models

00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:47,660
I made augmented reality in directions

00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,679
while closed you see something

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,659
obstructed but

00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:53,749
as you move back it resolves into

00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:56,210
something more tangible and real like

00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:58,549
with pointillism and cubism you can

00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,919
appreciate the details course it's only

00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:02,869
until you step back and take in the

00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,179
entire work that the forms start to

00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:07,879
resolve into something more than the sum

00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:11,330
of their parts it also reflects the

00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:14,299
training process of the works the slow

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:16,369
coming into being of certain forms some

00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,679
final artworks stood well with just the

00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:21,820
drawings saved as animations and some

00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,649
felt best with the 3d models attached I

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,179
also trained a neural network that

00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:32,929
specialized in writing captions for

00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:36,919
images in more more poetic language and

00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:38,509
I trained it to turn captions into short

00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,610
stories so that it could write a

00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:42,590
narrative about the works created by the

00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,889
game and the works created by me in

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,899
response it would detect features in the

00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:50,749
image then create a short caption and

00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:52,369
write a narrative about that caption the

00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:54,919
results for this were random but

00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:57,139
fascinating often only tangentially

00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,119
related to the subject but with a soft

00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:02,389
romance to the phrasing that I found

00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,919
compelling the images and the different

00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:06,049
3d models were submitted to the

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,179
narrative writer which generated

00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:11,299
passages Oh created passages of

00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:14,090
generated text I did some minor edits to

00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,490
the texts just grammatical stuff and had

00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,470
a text-to-speech synthesizer speak the

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:21,440
words it felt important to have a

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:23,690
digital voice as the narrator's of this

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,519
project and I feel particularly pleased

00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,159
with how the gender of the subject flips

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,990
around seemingly at random the gender of

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,610
the people in these works feels fluid

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,769
and I'm obscurely proud that the

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:37,549
machines saw and automatically produce

00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:39,679
these gender fluid results from here I

00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:41,690
United them all together in unity the

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,999
spoken word the music based on that were

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,009
generated captions and the interactions

00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:48,049
captions and options to turn off the

00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:51,740
sound were added and submitted to the

00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:54,289
different app stores this series is a

00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:57,799
true collaboration from me between my

00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:59,749
computer and myself the art is generated

00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:02,120
by machine with the information I

00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:04,159
provided it I then worked back

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,080
to the results and submitted them back

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,480
to the machine to see its interpretation

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,240
of my interpretation back and forth we'd

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,909
go and creating work creating heart

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:18,020
based on that work a mini collective of

00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:20,690
return I've often been asked why I chose

00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:22,940
augmented reality for my works of them

00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,850
with a thinly veiled insinuation that VR

00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,919
is where it's really at but a is not

00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,630
just a shiny buzzword it's more

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,970
accessible not just for people with

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,279
disabilities or people with visual

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,250
impairments or seizures but also for the

00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:39,880
average person who's more cautious

00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,919
around technology that not any of us but

00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,600
it there's a magic to downloading an app

00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:47,600
to your own device that allows you to

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,029
see something new in an artwork I see it

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,370
all the time it's a magic window that

00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:54,770
allows you to see something more a lens

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:57,289
it ends up being a smoother experience

00:33:54,770 --> 00:34:00,010
for people who would not otherwise try

00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:02,899
to access mixed reality technology

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:06,080
keeping our work simple and feature a

00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:08,540
meaning rich will help everyone embrace

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,220
new technologies in art the works I've

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,560
created have been made with mostly free

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,940
technologies the largest barrier for

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,790
entry has been the cost of being a

00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,830
registered developer there are so many

00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,200
free or inexpensive options for 3d

00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,240
modeling for game development for

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,540
augmented reality solutions there aren't

00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,339
that many barriers to getting started

00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,290
then trying to create works to exploring

00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:33,200
these new technologies and new avenues

00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:35,389
for self-expression new media is an

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,950
excellent option for a generation of

00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,050
artists who can't afford models can't

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,149
afford paint in canvas and printing

00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:44,570
costs there are free solutions out there

00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:46,040
for every one of your ideas and the

00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,530
tools to help you make your own

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:52,159
solutions the important thing is to get

00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:54,889
out there and try to develop and test

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,830
and explore and then to find your voice

00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,540
find what you want to say and bring the

00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,230
tree together to create something no one

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:06,200
has ever seen before

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:09,170
because as always the future of art is

00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,839
meaning I'm always looking for the next

00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:14,000
quest the next shiny the next useful

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,230
item I could squirrel away to use at a

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,720
later date

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,880
I live inside computer-generated worlds

00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,750
not just with my work but my relaxation

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,970
as well I guess the best part about

00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,400
being an artist specializing in 3d

00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,900
modeling and using products like unity

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,890
is that I can play games and call it

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:36,140
research because it's true everything

00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,510
you do has an impact on your work when

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,600
you're a creator you have no idea what

00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:44,260
the media you absorb is going to inspire

00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:48,800
so of course I take it upon myself to

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:50,210
read watch play lots because you never

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,280
know what inspiration is going to strike

00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:58,100
I have a massive file of ideas involving

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,190
VR robots 3d printing machine learning

00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:03,080
augmented reality I have to actively try

00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,290
to stop my mind from trying to split in

00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,960
a hundred different directions at once

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:11,210
as a chases each shiny new idea I keep

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,340
them all in ever narshe I'm constantly

00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,580
fighting against being caught up in the

00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:19,040
quest for the next big thing like an RPG

00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,109
I'm always drawn to the next shiny item

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,490
the next challenge and being a tech

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:25,310
artist that just allows me to have more

00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:28,220
excuses to explore the technology that

00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:31,520
excites me the most this can be a curse

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:34,040
and a blessing as I and I know you all

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,470
understand what I mean when I say what a

00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:41,090
distraction the latest shiny technology

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:44,119
can be tech like a R & B are shiny and

00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:47,390
exciting machine learning is shiny and

00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:49,670
exciting I get so caught up in all of

00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,920
the amazing things I can do and learn

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,930
all the different things I can try and

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,690
all the ways I can go higher faster

00:36:53,930 --> 00:37:00,590
further more I get so excited by what I

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:04,520
could do sometimes I forget why or even

00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:07,580
if I should and that brings me back to

00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,770
the question from my supervisor as an

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:14,090
artist I have to step back and say wait

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:17,119
but why what is going to what is this

00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:19,970
going to say where is the artwork in all

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,210
of this work and that is the key

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:25,700
question when making art whether it's a

00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:27,770
painting a sculpture or an augmented

00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,549
reality installation with 3d modeling

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,859
and machine learning

00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:32,989
based interactions it's one thing to

00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:35,359
want to make the thing or to be able to

00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:39,769
make the thing the main question is why

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,959
I ran against this question a lot I know

00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:44,869
some people consider mixed reality to be

00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:47,420
gimmicky but I believe the mixed reality

00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:50,599
gives us a unique capability to tap into

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,309
the minds of our viewers art like tech

00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,650
is about experimentation

00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:56,479
it's about absorbing information from

00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,869
everywhere and everything and distilling

00:37:56,479 --> 00:38:01,670
it into a messages from your brain we're

00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:03,559
trying to make a difference to create

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,289
feelings and experiences in a viewer

00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,900
that they may never have felt before

00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:11,689
we constantly quest to find our order in

00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,910
chaos in many ways this is what the

00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:16,670
basis of art is trying to make sense of

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:20,689
ourselves and our world we create the

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,459
concepts we absorb VR and AR are perfect

00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:25,309
tools for hacking the viewer if you use

00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:27,650
them correctly they're uniquely placed

00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:30,679
to alter the world of the viewer in a

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:33,709
very literal way to draw them into the

00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:37,969
art which is why what we have to say is

00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:40,279
of even more importance we encounter so

00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:42,650
much through screen these days we

00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:44,449
process our news thoughts socialization

00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,779
relationships through the lens of a

00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:49,969
screen we gain gamified discuss fight

00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:52,819
consume collaborate support and

00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:56,029
celebrate on a daily basis on our phones

00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:59,029
our tablets our computers this digital

00:38:56,029 --> 00:39:00,709
frontier is for us as a norm a way to

00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:02,359
keep in touch with people on the other

00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:06,650
side of the world or on the other side

00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:09,619
of the room we have the power as artists

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,109
to draw people inside our worlds to make

00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:14,269
them see things in new ways to craft

00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:17,119
narratives and concepts and change

00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:19,880
people's minds what avenues are open to

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,160
expression if artists open their minds

00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,799
to the idea of allowing viewers to take

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,959
part in their worlds to go beyond the

00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:29,390
viewing experience to connecting with it

00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:32,529
to allowing themselves to be immersed

00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:35,449
within the minds eye of the artist the

00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:37,009
scrutiny turned on new media works means

00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:40,069
they have to be well executed and

00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:42,109
powerfully meaningful what we choose to

00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:45,349
do with its power will determine the fee

00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:48,289
of mixed reality and art in the validity

00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:50,359
of new technology hinges on its message

00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:52,579
the future viability of that work and

00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:54,559
the future history of the piece will be

00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:57,680
forever marked by what you have to say

00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,359
just as much as how you say it using

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,480
these new tools as masterfully as

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,789
possible is of course vital just as all

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,099
artists must become masters of their

00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:09,349
medium the pieces need to resonate and

00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:11,450
with tools readily and often freely

00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:13,460
available and the open minds of the

00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,989
viewers we can ensure an excellent

00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,420
connection between the viewer and the

00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:27,380
content between the real and the digital

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:28,190
thank you thank you so much Jane that

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,980
was amazing

00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,410
we do have time for a handful of

00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:38,029
questions um I actually have one I want

00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:41,059
to start with how have you found the the

00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:43,819
visual art and painting establishment

00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:46,339
how do they approach your work in it and

00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:48,980
what what of their reactions Ben it's a

00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:51,829
really interesting question um I think

00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,009
that it's are some of them like they go

00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:57,049
in I I've had a bit of a experience was

00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:59,180
sort of saying some of the critics and

00:40:57,049 --> 00:41:01,910
some of the old school they'll come in

00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:06,349
oh no no no no no no and then they see

00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:09,079
the interaction and like I hate they

00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:11,269
actually they never thought that they

00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:12,589
would see something like that and so at

00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:17,690
first they think it's a bit ridiculous

00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:19,670
but then if if they get become part of

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,549
the interaction and they see it they

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:25,430
start to appreciate it more there's

00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:27,349
there's still a bit of a yeah it's it

00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:30,200
can be a bit interesting in the art

00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:32,180
world but the tech art world is very

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,210
good as well so I think that we're

00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,259
gaining ground cool thank you does

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,549
anyone else have a question

00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:39,549
I'll come and bring the mic to you

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:56,780
okay have you open-sourced any of your

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,440
own code that you've used to create

00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,730
these works

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:05,420
I've open sourced the scripts that I use

00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:08,390
- so the iterative animations and things

00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:12,349
like that they're all available on my

00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:12,890
github there it's it's kind of

00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:15,589
embarrassing

00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,570
yeah I've put some bash scripts up but

00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:20,750
they actually made a huge difference to

00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:24,920
when you're processing massive batches

00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:26,920
of images to create an animation because

00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,710
they're all saved as individual images

00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,510
it's it helps to have scripts to do all

00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:35,720
of that and so yeah I've published all

00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:38,359
the automation scripts I haven't I've

00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,250
changed some of the code in that I've

00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:42,020
been working with but all the code that

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:46,780
I work with is is available online so

00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,780
