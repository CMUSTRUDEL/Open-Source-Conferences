I'm a developer who likes writing programs using text (e.g. Python, Go, InterCAL). But I also like to draw diagrams. Let's combine the two approaches with a development environment I've been working on in my spare time for the last couple of years. 

Connect up some blocks, write a bit of code, huzzah! A program!

Note: This talk will have nothing whatsoever to do with blockchain technology.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
