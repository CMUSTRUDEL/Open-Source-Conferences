Title: Stepping up the game against Web trackers
Publication date: 2020-01-09

The attempt to standardize the Do-Not-Track HTTP request header is going nowhere, and it's cute anyway, in that it expects the other
side to honour the request, and how would we know if they did? After all, tracking is serious business, and it's hard to imagine a company in this field walking past money lying on the street without picking it up.

Martin is at war with what the Web has become, and he's here to talk to you about techniques he's using to minimise his browsing
footprint on a day to day basis. Do not attend if you'd prefer to think of the Web as the decentralized knowledge-sharing network it was originally conceived as.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

thanks Kiara Ben Kiara katoa who here

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:18,119
has heard of gopher and who likes gopher

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,770
wow that's not a whole lot I really did

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,830
like go for a whole lot because you know

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,939
it was a protocol that allowed me to

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,000
extract information and while the

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,460
usability wasn't really that great I

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,570
wasn't distracted by a lot of the bling

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,860
that we see nowadays on the web and

00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,110
probably as many of you thank you very

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,780
much for showing up probably like many

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,149
of you I'm sort of at war with what the

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,309
web has become because when I go out

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,140
there and I want to surf I want the

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,329
information I I know what I want to get

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,200
and I don't want anything other solved

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,960
into my face

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,910
but unfortunately today's experience of

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,070
the web is quite a different one let me

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,570
just for the sake of demonstration so

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,579
this is this talk is going to be a live

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,660
demo I have sacrificed a goat this

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,660
morning so it should work out

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:14,369
unfortunately I'm a little bit unused to

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,420
the UI here the the the resolution so

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,600
you might have to bear with me a little

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,790
bit let's load a web site start codon

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,159
and Zed which is sort of the slash dot

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:29,520
of New Zealand don't quote me on that

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,950
and here you go stuff is loading what

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,610
you can see down here in the network

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,740
console are HTTP requests are being sent

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,530
out from my browser to various parts of

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:46,350
the Internet as part of the web site

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:48,750
loading up here and and here is a

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,850
wonderful extension called Firefox

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,399
lightbeam that attempts to visualize

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,360
what's going on so it went really fast

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,520
the network here is blazingly fast but

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,590
you can see that every single one of

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,719
these triangles that have gathered

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,880
around the circle in the middle which is

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,660
my website are actually third parties

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,300
that my browser has reached out to in

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,230
order to obtain resources or maybe to

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,790
let that party

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,230
or what I'm doing in total its 23

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,090
third-party sites and I'm a little bit

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,610
confused right now because when I did

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,530
this yesterday showed 73 and so I'm

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,690
thinking that I may have left some of

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,880
the settings that I'm about to talk to

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,580
you about on and so we're being

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,550
protected from trackers oh yeah here it

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,950
is tracking protection so Firefox

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,599
actually has tracking protection built

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,910
in in recent versions let me turn that

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,730
off and reload the page because I want

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,799
this to be a little bit bigger there you

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,180
go we're 26 already it's still loading

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,459
it's still loading you can see all the

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,410
requests down here we're still loading

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,010
there's a whole bunch about to come in

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,230
there you go

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:59,790
27 29 32 34 35 and so on and so forth

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,280
look at what's happening down here I'm

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,989
just loading a web site and I'm just

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,069
loading your website I'm okay let's be

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:12,209
fair for a second let me take stuff

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:14,370
coded and dead out of this right so this

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,620
is now only the requests that are not

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,230
going to anywhere within the stuff that

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,810
coded in that domain we're at 68

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,489
third-party sites 69 third-party 70 71

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:30,359
72 and 73 oh yes something changed 75

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:32,670
this is amazing 76 77 the world is

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,139
finding out about me visiting this

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,000
website and I haven't even started

00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:43,160
scrolling yet yeah I mean let's scroll

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,180
okay are you ready for this let's scroll

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,970
okay nothing's happening this is a bit

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,519
of it anti-climactic situation here I'm

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:55,370
not prepared for this theoretically

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,660
there's more stuff going on that's right

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,769
theoretically technology has it such

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,959
that trackers what we're visiting here

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:07,650
witnessing here trackers actually have

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,700
the ability to analyze how much time I'm

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,340
spending on a given section of a website

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,250
so as to and that is the entire problem

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,799
that I'm talking to you about today

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,239
maximize ad revenue because at some

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,340
point in time somebody came up with the

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,280
idea that to finance the free Internet

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,889
we serve ads and then obviously someone

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,930
thought

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,919
better of it and said no that's wrong

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,050
expression in English

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,360
somebody improved upon that idea and

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,159
started to serve ads that you wanted to

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,810
see and that was basically the birth of

00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:43,360
the ad industry as we know it nowadays

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,900
now I don't want to risk doing too much

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,189
of an HTTP 101 course here but do let me

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,409
quickly look at what one of these

00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:52,659
requests is so that we know what we're

00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:54,189
talking about at other conferences

00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,389
there's this thing called clicking you

00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:57,699
know people start clicking when they

00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:59,199
really like something I'm gonna propose

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,879
that you start clicking when you really

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,830
don't like what I'm doing so that I get

00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,550
an idea about when when I'm boring you

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:10,289
so I can move on yeah so let's look at

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:14,819
one of these requests here let's go to

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:17,620
pub Matic calm for instance and let's

00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,439
look at specifically the requests that

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,990
I'm sending out so you can see a couple

00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,719
of fields in here there I'm sending I'm

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,870
telling this pub Matic comm website I

00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:30,939
have no idea what they do but stuff

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,699
supposedly does that I'm surfing the web

00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,949
with my mozilla 5.0 it's actually

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,620
running on a PowerPC Mac it's not the

00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:42,399
case but we're faking a user agent here

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,279
a little bit yeah I was supposed to have

00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,389
turned that off but apparently I didn't

00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,370
I'm sorry about that

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,960
and we're also telling it the refer

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,000
where I'm coming from again this is

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,069
they're actually not supposed to be that

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,800
website already you just have a look

00:05:54,069 --> 00:06:00,240
what I'm doing wrong here there's

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,240
something not set correctly

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,080
okay well for all intents and purposes

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,290
the theory goes that my browser is

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,570
telling this website on the request that

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,310
is being made that I'm coming from a

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,620
different website so that actually the

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,060
websites out there can plot where I'm

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:31,900
coming from and where I'm going to any

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:34,810
okay sorry and then finally there's

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,490
another field in here called cookie and

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,260
basically I'm not going to tell you much

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,500
about cookies but basically last time I

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,790
went to that site the web server

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,980
instructed my browser to please when it

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,940
comes back to that web server send that

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:52,030
information presumably so they can

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,550
present a customized version but also so

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,190
they can track me so I don't

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,260
particularly like that pretty sure that

00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,270
nobody out there would particularly like

00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,820
that if they knew what was going on but

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,950
as we heard from Serena earlier nobody

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,170
really knows or cares or has the

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,140
possibility to really do something about

00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:14,410
that so what I want to show you today is

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,880
a selection of Firefox add-ons most of

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,410
those work with chromium as well by the

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,990
way that I use in order to minimize the

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,660
footprint print that I leave when I surf

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,120
the web and first and foremost of those

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,970
my absolute favorite is called you

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,480
matrix now you matrix is not about the

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:41,380
matrix you matrix is about a table with

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:43,660
rows and columns and I'm going to try to

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,800
figure out how to use the very limited

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,930
screen estate that I have available to

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,000
show you what I mean there you go this

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,750
is you matrix you I it is currently

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,180
disabled but I'm trying to show you what

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,120
it can do because when you scroll down

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,780
on the UI of you matrix you can see in

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,450
the rows every single server that my

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,610
browser has reached out to and in the

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,710
columns the type of resource that is

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,500
being requested so about half way down

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,810
the the line now yeah it's a lot going

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,520
on clearly everything of all of that is

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,520
necessary for me to just read the news

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,159
so this this may or may not be a better

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,899
way to illustrate what's going on I mean

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,180
light beam is very visual this is a

00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:35,089
little bit more structured versus the

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,339
network console that I showed with a lot

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:40,099
of data that are basically swampthing

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,949
going to swamp anyone looking at it but

00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,250
the great thing about you matrix is that

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:48,529
I can actually now start interacting in

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,990
configuring my browser and telling my

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,389
browser specifically what I wanted to do

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,060
and what I don't want it to do right now

00:08:53,389 --> 00:09:01,130
the whole thing is disabled so I'm going

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:03,350
to turn this on and the visuals have

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,870
changed to the point where yellow now

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,860
indicates I want resources to be loaded

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,630
from this site and blue means I do not

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,569
want this site the server to be

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:17,420
contacted you'll also notice that up

00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:21,199
here in the column header CSS and image

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,600
is selected by default because clearly

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,760
we need style sheets and we also need

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,690
images always on from everywhere and

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,690
because images and CSS files are not

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:37,040
Google Analytics nobody's going to track

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:39,769
us right well I'm pretty sure you all

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,880
have heard of the 1x1 pixel images that

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,860
are being loaded there are quite a

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,959
couple of stuff on stuff coda and Zed

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,880
which I'm not going to bother

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,110
identifying in a network stream right

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,959
now so let's get rid of images and load

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,490
them only when I need them not by

00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,649
default anyway and this is a choice that

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,959
I can make using this user interface and

00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:03,230
also CSS files I mean it's great that I

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:07,010
can you know have bold and larger fonts

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:11,089
and even wet fonts yeah but then again

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:15,250
fun start Google API so calm I'm not

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,250
saying that that is a tracking resource

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,949
but if I were running a company that

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:27,410
whose business model was based on data I

00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:28,850
might might use those access logs so I'm

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,399
turning it off I'm turning the default

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,230
off turning the follow-on images off

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,280
that's actually now for stuff

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,040
cohdon and Zedd let me explain one other

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,020
part of this UI which is the very top

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,060
left corner you can see that I can

00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,280
actually apply different rules to

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,250
different sub parts of the domain so I

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,040
can actually make rules apply to wwo or

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,840
just to stuff Doug coded and Zedd or

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,020
just decoded and Ed which is highly

00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,080
useful or to everything and as a matter

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,390
of fact I kind of I personally make the

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,960
choice that by default for everything

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:09,640
out there I do not want CSS and images

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,410
to be loaded from any resource out there

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,270
except for the first party because

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,310
that's kind of the point of the web I

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,760
mean you know if you're yeah you get it

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,530
so I'm going to keep that on I'm also

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,180
going to allow frames from the first

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,400
party frames or otherwise considered

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,290
evil sometimes that's which is why

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,420
they're blue up here but I'm going to

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,840
allow that for the first party so if I

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,420
go back and change the view to stuff

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,460
that coded and Zed the default of CSS

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,980
and images has now changed

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,280
none of these images and CSS further

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:45,400
down here are being loaded by default

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,990
except for the first party because I'm

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,270
actually prepared to give my data to

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,730
stuff otherwise I shouldn't be browsing

00:11:50,270 --> 00:12:00,470
their website in the first place so with

00:11:52,730 --> 00:12:02,390
that in place let's reload down here we

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,910
have the network console I'm going to

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:07,370
leave the filter off showing nothing

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,670
that actually goes to stuff itself in

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,800
place and I've reset over here the light

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:18,110
beam data I'm going to do a ctrl shift

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:22,880
are and reload the stuff website note

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,140
how the network console stays empty this

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,380
means that there are currently no

00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:31,100
requests being sent to any other website

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,740
out there except for stuff itself look

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,340
at light beam to third-party sites being

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,550
contacted

00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:40,400
what are those oh my god stuff codon and

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,770
Zed and resources start stuff that coded

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,950
in debt I consider that okay in the

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,080
context of this exercise and what about

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,120
the website

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,880
Hey look it's got a headline there's

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:58,820
text it's even got images it's almost

00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:02,290
like I can read the news but there are

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:06,470
no advertisements there are no trackers

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:09,920
nobody else but stuff and myself find

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:12,230
out right now what I'm doing now at this

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,410
point in time I'd like to say that stuff

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:19,790
and various other journalistic agencies

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:22,400
out there they do their stuff common

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,410
words there they do their work for free

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,040
on the web kinda right

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,900
ads are used to pay salaries and I'm in

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,360
no position here and I certainly do not

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,830
want to advertise for there's another

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,960
problem where it's there gosh I'm so

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:41,170
terrible advertised for blocking ads but

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,230
it's sort of what the game has become

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:47,420
ads are a symptom or maybe the cause

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:50,090
they're definitely right in the middle

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,750
of this tracking business and if I value

00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:56,120
my privacy and ads are but what go

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,480
against my privacy choices then I'm

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,670
sorry but I won't load them I'm sorry

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,470
stuff Dakota and Zed I'll load your web

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,360
site I'll happily consume your news and

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,880
hey if you allowed me to for instance

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,950
have a very simple micropayments process

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,540
by which I could give you a dollar every

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,850
single time I like something I might

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,270
actually do that but I'm certainly not

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,880
going to pay with my data with my usage

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:23,720
patterns that you feed on - how many

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:26,540
were there 78 79 third-party sites who

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:34,190
will do with those data I don't know

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:36,290
what now I've actually said nobody but

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,150
myself and stuff find out about this and

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:43,850
this is because another extension that

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:45,260
I've used here is HTTPS Everywhere we've

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,260
kind of gotten to the point now where

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,470
almost everything is HTTPS anyway but

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,330
please do have that extension enabled in

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,300
your browsers anyway because it ensures

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,650
that even though there are legacy

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,990
possibilities of contacting web servers

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,560
on port 80 this extension will make sure

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,690
that that

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,840
only happens once the first time and

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,930
from then on you'll be on a secure

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:13,760
connection whatever secure means in that

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:15,380
context so I'm going to enable that it's

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,410
going to reload the website but nothing

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,660
is actually going to change over here

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:23,120
just to complement matrix gives me a

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,610
couple of other tools that I hope wrong

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,080
extension a couple of other tools that I

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:33,890
can use to further limit my footprint

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,310
and those are for bidding mixed content

00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:40,700
that's I believe non SSL content and SSL

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,170
websites for bidding web workers if any

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,360
of you have been to key week on there

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,640
was a fantastic talk about service

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,890
workers and web workers those kind of

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,380
processes in your browser that can stick

00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,680
around for hours after you stop visiting

00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,510
a web site and actually act in your

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,160
behalf within your environment and keep

00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,920
sending data back and forth so you may

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,140
not want that you can turn these off

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,960
globally you can turn them on for

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,850
individual websites very helpful spoof

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,390
the referer header somehow I already did

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,490
that which basically just means I'm not

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,780
going to tell any site where I'm coming

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,339
from but I'm just gonna pretend that I'm

00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,350
coming from their site so you saw that

00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:20,420
earlier when we went to that advertising

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,130
page it pretended to come from the

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,530
advertising page to the advertising page

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:28,390
and then also no script tags I can spoof

00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:32,180
those and furthermore reducing my my

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,880
footprint now sometimes you need special

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,100
functionality for instance of course

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:43,220
Google's cognitive capitalism reCAPTCHA

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,990
and YouTube and Twitter and so on the

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,610
recent versions of you matrix have

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,220
allowed you to make it very easy to just

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:52,970
download this recipe that will then

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,790
enable a recapture for this very web

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,890
session that you're in because unless

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,080
you choose to actually persist the

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,400
changes by clicking on this lock button

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,579
which I've just done without touching

00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:07,699
your mouse button that's gonna wait they

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,470
will not stay around and when you open

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,520
the browser the next time you'll start

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,520
again with a clean slide

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,270
now at this point let me quickly open up

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,850
the Preferences of the browser this is

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,160
Firefox chromium or Chrome has has very

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:28,970
similar preferences for privacy and

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,610
security and you know it gives you the

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,770
possibility now to shoot to block

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,040
trackers Firefox light beam is actually

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,630
controlling this and I had it turned off

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,130
or now have it turned off also

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,400
third-party cookies and cookies in

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,830
general interestingly you'll note that I

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,830
choose not to block third-party cookies

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:51,620
in the browser preferences because it is

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,950
a bit of a 1 and 0 decision that I'm

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,180
making here third stop resources

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,740
thoughts after codon and Zed was

00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,060
considered a third party I don't really

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,880
want to be blocking the cookies I

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:05,120
wondered much more fine-grained control

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,730
over the tracking behavior that my

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,020
browser is exposing and you matrix

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,010
actually gives that to me the first

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,770
column here in that matrix is about

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,120
cookies and I'd much more prefer rather

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,400
than saying no third party cookies

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,620
whatsoever I'd rather be able to say

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,600
look I want cookies from stuff I

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,690
actually want cookies from akamai and

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,580
then I can able them here or I can say

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,460
that Adam Asia I actually want to use

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,530
all of them you'll see that the frame

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,480
block will override this and so on

00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,000
play around with a UI a little bit it's

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,440
a fantastic resource to use it gives you

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,090
a lot of control and I think it's very

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,130
intuitive at least to mathematically

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:46,670
thinking minds which is unfortunately

00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:49,780
not the vast majority of the of the web

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:55,490
users out there but that's another story

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:58,070
also sometimes similar to recapture

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,070
sometimes you need to use resources that

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,810
are being made available on third-party

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:09,590
websites let's have a look at Stack

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:11,210
Overflow when I load Stack Overflow then

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,100
it doesn't really work right I mean

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,490
that's okay that's a gopher experience

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,490
for you right there

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,550
so I'm gonna have a quick look am I mean

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,190
okay that needs to be loaded

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,580
stackoverflow static okay so on and so

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,320
forth

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,510
I can reload the website right there

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,700
note how the UI stays in place actually

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,590
even forms that you filled in will stay

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,140
filled in if you reload it's really nice

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,470
I love it but one thing you'll notice

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,840
that okay I'm not gonna go going to demo

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,440
this right now but one thing about the

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,020
website may not work and that's because

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,840
like overflow loads Ajax libraries from

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,820
Google API so calm and you know even

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,440
though that's not Google Analytics com

00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,530
maybe it's still being used for tracking

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,240
so but I I kind of need to enable it now

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,040
because otherwise I can't use the

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,260
website I'm a little bit in a ditch at

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,440
this point in time now wouldn't it be

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,970
fantastic if I could just download the

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,520
Ajax libraries I mean it's all open

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,560
source all of these companies are built

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,180
on open stories anyway it's all open

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,420
source if I could just download that and

00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,070
serve it locally yeah squit transparent

00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:26,600
proxy on my laptop okay let's not go

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:29,210
there let's use another extension that

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,770
allows me to check this box here and say

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,450
I actually would like to allow something

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,300
is really wrong with my mouse button I

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,940
would really like to allow script

00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,750
loading from Ajax a Google API is calm

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:44,690
but actually not contact Google API so

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:48,080
calm that extension is called

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:52,130
decentralize with eyes at the end rather

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,740
than is e or ize and the idea of

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:59,000
decentralize is that it includes a

00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:01,400
couple of standard resources that can be

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,110
served locally and that we which are

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:08,300
being updated by this add-on so I had it

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,970
previously disabled here nothing ever

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,530
happened but if I know now reload Stack

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,300
Overflow

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:17,270
you can see that decentralized actually

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,040
intercepted a Google hosted library

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,550
jQuery and served it from a local

00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,100
resource so now a Stack Overflow works

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:28,070
because I can run Ajax but Google did

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,059
not find out about it by the way if I'm

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,399
going to be releasing

00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:33,740
maybe to the conference mailing list

00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:35,990
list of these add-ons that I'm talking

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,820
to you about so that you can look at

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,580
them one by one after the talk you don't

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:46,879
have to take notes or scramble to take

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:52,820
them down so that's great at this point

00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:55,600
in time let me introduce another why did

00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,600
I have this in here

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,010
there was a very good reason why I

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:10,029
wanted you to look at board panda and I

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:12,549
can't remember now so let me just skip

00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:16,659
over that and instead talk to you about

00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:18,640
cookies because cookies are actually

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,649
also useful they're not just used for

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,340
tracking they are also used to store

00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:28,140
your customizations of a site and maybe

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:33,580
also your login cookies your tokens that

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:35,019
for for OAuth or what have you this

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,570
extension which is called cookie

00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:39,250
auto-delete gives you again fine-grained

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,590
control over the way that your browser

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,970
deals with cookies generally in the

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,279
preferences of the browser you can

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,100
choose to delete the cookies after the

00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:51,990
browser session or honor the lifetime of

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:54,669
the cookie but that is a global setting

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,679
what cookie auto-delete allows you to do

00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:58,510
is to first of all control this on a per

00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,880
side basis actually on a per cookie

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,289
basis by now that's the latest version

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,200
that introduced this and then

00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:06,850
furthermore it can enable cookies but

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,399
get rid of them right after you stopped

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:12,639
visiting a website so if you look at the

00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:15,460
settings then it has this thing called

00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:19,299
automatic cleaning and I can set it to

00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:21,519
120 seconds or 86,400 or whatever your

00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:23,320
preference is again this is about giving

00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,010
you the power to make your own choices

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,980
and then when I stopped visiting stuffed

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,840
or coder Lyndsey 120 seconds later this

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,240
extension will go through your browser

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,610
local storage and delete all the cookies

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,610
and all the local storage except for the

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,470
ones that you ID listed and this is

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,970
actually what the UI that I just showed

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:47,730
is all about

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:50,169
I could whitelist board panda comm and

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,240
that would mean that when I restart my

00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:54,279
browser the cookies that board panda set

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,110
would be available again if I only gray

00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,120
listed board panda calm then they would

00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:04,559
simply stay around until the end of the

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:07,149
browser session so at this point in time

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,570
I'm ready to take some questions but I

00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:12,610
would like let me let me do one more one

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,289
more of these add-ons which is called

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,830
multi account containers that's actually

00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:18,049
not really an add-on it's actually if

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,909
that is being built into Firefox and has

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:24,049
been there for a lot of years who's used

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:27,950
multi-account containers that is the

00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:31,970
vast minority okay multi-account

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:35,149
containers are basically containers for

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,669
tabs or domains tabs actually I think

00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:39,590
and the idea is that you'll have a

00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:41,870
different set of cookies and local

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,769
storage and browsing history and so on

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:48,710
and so forth for individual sites you

00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:50,600
can load facebook in one container and

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,340
twitter in another container and the

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,570
browser they would actually never be

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,010
able to find out about each other

00:24:53,570 --> 00:25:03,320
sessions because they have completely

00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:05,029
separate namespaces you can you can edit

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:10,820
these containers and there is actually

00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:18,740
an integration with the cookie R to

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:20,630
delete UI and you can choose to keep

00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,200
certain cookies for certain containers

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:27,620
and furthermore compartmentalize the way

00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,940
that you interact with the web so I

00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,980
think that now that I've shown you the

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,690
most the four most important of these

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,860
add-ons and I have a couple of more to

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,360
go that are about minor or less less

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,389
obvious ways in which you're being

00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,340
tracked at this point in time are there

00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:48,549
any questions is there anything I can I

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:51,440
can answer yes how do you go with these

00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:54,799
extensions becoming stale one of the big

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,190
problems with the Mozilla ecosystem in

00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,200
the browser is that you end up with

00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:03,019
extensions firstly that just don't get

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,690
maintained and and when they have a big

00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,970
changeover like they did recently a lot

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,880
of extensions just stopped working right

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:14,000
and secondly the the whole issue of

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,130
people selling their extension to a

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,940
third party and ending up with malware

00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:22,669
in the extension yeah that's a very good

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,880
question all the extensions I've shown

00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:28,820
so far are life projects that are

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,750
completely free and open source there

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,510
are some

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,150
that like was the one called gostrey

00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,680
rent gostrey is one that that used to do

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,780
a lot of this work and also request

00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,730
policy which have been sold and nobody

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,680
really knows what happens now anymore

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,530
with them so it's part of your due

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,690
diligence really to look at this sort of

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,400
aspect but that's the same due diligence

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,050
you would do with any tool that you

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,760
invest some time with and choose to

00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,040
actually incorporate into your workflow

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,840
and I'm part of your due diligence here

00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,210
because I'm telling you these are great

00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,650
and the more of you who jump on board

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:03,470
the greater they will be because they

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:07,010
will all actually have repos on github

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:09,290
so it's and they are very how should I

00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:12,920
say they are meeting a big demand at the

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:15,200
moment so that the activity in these

00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,930
repos is actually very high so I'm

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,850
confident that they're good but in ten

00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:26,150
years we'll have other ones better ones

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:28,700
ai Thank You Martin one of the things

00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:32,120
I'm seeing is people have these API keys

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,800
and it goes part of the get and any of

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,440
these browsers with their extensions

00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,210
practie that's also a security hole

00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,250
somebody can start selling these API

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,960
keys when they log to their site and

00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,290
things like that have you thought of

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,870
that

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,390
yeah those API keys I referred to them

00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:49,990
earlier as authentication tokens I mean

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,520
it's part of the authentication

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:56,050
ecosystem there now they are stored in

00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:02,600
local storage in your browser and so a

00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:04,070
this the cookie auto-delete extension

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,120
for instance can take care of local

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,670
storage for you as well

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,460
so you can have those API keys deleted

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:13,160
120 seconds after you leave a tab I

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:17,930
don't know how they fit into the matrix

00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:19,810
UI maybe other it's possible but that's

00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,550
definitely something to look at

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,960
API keys are only I mean you're you're

00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,130
touching on an important subject here

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,220
I've shown you this sort of like

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,930
low-hanging fruits of the footprint that

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,180
you're leaving on the web there are a

00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:35,960
lot more there's this wonderful website

00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:38,540
called browser leaks and basically

00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,420
browser leaks gives a lot of tools that

00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,950
you can run to test how much information

00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,580
trackable information your browser is

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,070
leaking

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:49,130
during the the session and it goes as

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:51,200
far as you know exploiting bugs in

00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:55,660
JavaScript implementations of particular

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,430
browsers that then allow pretty accurate

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:00,080
identification of a person that has

00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,570
previously been to the site so tracking

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,290
you but I won't go into every single one

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:08,540
of these now let's take one more and

00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:11,420
then let me do some more extensions and

00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:15,920
do more questions at the end yeah I am I

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:18,230
maintain usually a slash @ z slash hosts

00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,910
file to block all the sort of the common

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,240
offenders do you do that and if so

00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:31,250
what's been your experience blocking

00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:34,700
things that way et Cie hosts is a DNS

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:37,550
type like precursor i mean basically

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,890
what you can express there and can only

00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,450
happen on the level of looking up the

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:44,690
main names and resolving them into IP

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:48,890
addresses i wouldn't know for instance

00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:50,540
how many domains google owns so i don't

00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,060
know what to put in there i mean

00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,680
obviously it is a good resource and

00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,210
especially with what does it call add

00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,620
away or something on android i mean

00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,870
that's one of the only resources that

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,750
you have to actually block tracking

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:04,990
across all of the apps but I think it's

00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:08,540
it's actually either at the wrong level

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,100
so if you wanted to prevent tracking at

00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:15,470
the HTTP level you got to be speaking

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:25,280
HTTP and not DNS that said you matrix

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:27,020
does have a way to auto update assets so

00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,210
a couple of people have will publish

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:34,120
hosts files and so on and then you

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:37,820
matrix puts those into the into the UI

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,820
because I didn't go through and and make

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:44,270
every single one of these rows that have

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,500
tracking capabilities blue that was

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:52,460
actually provided by some of these

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:55,550
third-party assets ok now let me

00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,559
continue and give you a couple of more

00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,049
add-ons

00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:01,820
I think the reason why I loaded board

00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:03,739
panda was because of the service workers

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,119
and because I turned off service workers

00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:08,619
earlier on you matrix you didn't

00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:14,269
actually get to see this extension here

00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:15,889
except he did in action so block service

00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:17,659
workers is really easy it just blocks

00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:19,999
service workers it actually doesn't

00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:21,769
provide a way to whitelist them at the

00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:23,539
moment which is kind enough because

00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:25,539
sometimes you really need them at the

00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:28,460
moment my Twitter experience basically

00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:31,159
means that nothing can get pushed to me

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,529
all I have to reload to see if somebody

00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:34,070
has mentioned me which actually isn't so

00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:37,190
bad

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:39,830
think about it it's worse with github

00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,359
for instance I mean github is lovely in

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,669
the sense that I can write a comment on

00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,369
a patch and then when the author writes

00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:48,559
back 30 seconds later I will actually I

00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:50,299
will actually be able to have a

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,730
discussion right there in almost

00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,950
real-time that of course is run by a

00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,480
service worker and by blocking service

00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,940
workers altogether I'm disabling that

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,690
but then again you know the thought of

00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:05,869
this convenience versus the idea that a

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:08,570
thread keeps running for hours after I

00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:10,759
closed the tab and still operates within

00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:14,119
the context of my interaction with that

00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:16,489
website is kind of scary and so I choose

00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:21,879
that which I consider a more safer

00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:25,759
approach there's also this thing called

00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:27,980
tracking in the query strings right

00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,720
you've all see the scene the UTM source

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:34,279
and UTM whatever it is and ways by which

00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,399
the companies are trying to figure out

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:41,059
which channel brought you to their

00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:43,309
website and you can you can leave that

00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:47,210
on of course because after all it is

00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:49,759
very helpful also to companies to find

00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:52,549
out what sort of outreach what sort of

00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,409
marketing actually is effective but if

00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:57,679
you really care more about your privacy

00:32:54,409 --> 00:33:00,049
you can turn them off you can using this

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,789
extension here which is control called

00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:04,669
request control rules you can disable

00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:09,200
for instance Google link tracking by

00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:10,919
simply ticking this box and block beacon

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,830
requests beacons being

00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,289
little messages that are being sent out

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,090
regularly to tracking sites to make sure

00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:25,859
that they will find out continuously

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:31,739
what you are up to on the web now I'm

00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:35,489
Barrett there's actually it's very much

00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:37,019
oh shoot I can't find this no that's the

00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:38,609
thing with live demos here and like in

00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,230
the state of adrenaline and then you're

00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:41,489
like this is so easy I do it all the

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,419
time and now I just can't figure out how

00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:47,909
to do it so excuse me have a look the

00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:50,629
extension yourself and there's a manual

00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:50,629
tada

00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,980
it allows you to customize all of this

00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,200
and basically to your liking but I

00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,359
already find the UI to be very intuitive

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,340
and it'll take you a long way towards

00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:04,799
protecting your privacy just to install

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,720
it and it sort of has privacy and

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,760
security by default most of these have

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,049
them by default in the settings which I

00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,659
think goes very much in line with what

00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:15,359
serena has said earlier and also is what

00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,909
you should be doing what's another

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,329
extension I have how many minutes do I

00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,030
have left

00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:22,770
ten minutes okay let me show you these

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:26,099
two more extensions and then I think we

00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:28,409
can call it a day yeah here you go

00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:32,069
current active user agent yeah I'm using

00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:33,690
Apple WebKit Chrome which is in Safari

00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:37,379
which is definitely not the case I mean

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,960
look at this laptop so this is actually

00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:41,549
an extension called random UA and I'm

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,940
sort of trying to hack on it a little

00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:46,649
bit to the point where I'd like to have

00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,990
the browser send out a different user

00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:51,750
agent for every single request just to

00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:53,429
make it extremely hard for anyone out

00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,399
there to correlate my behavior and

00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,660
because it's not so cool if at some

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,890
point in time it's going to be sending

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,760
out the fact that I'm using Internet

00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:04,170
Explorer 4 so yeah well duck typing is

00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,859
not something that web developers have

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:10,079
heard of but I've I kind of figured out

00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:12,510
that what we can do is actually pretend

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,640
that we're using Internet Explorer 425

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:19,470
and then you know chrome 7218 just keep

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,319
going up basically because then you'll

00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:24,810
get all the cool features having a

00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:30,390
modern browser is the way to go anyway

00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:31,920
James I'd the the answer I didn't

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:37,320
understand what he was saying but I will

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:41,010
say yes and let's virus test pattern I

00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:51,690
know the virus test pattern ok we'll

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:53,640
chat yes the question was have you

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,250
considered that by generating a unique

00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,160
user agent string you're giving everyone

00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:01,860
the ability to track you even better yes

00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,450
for that one request that next image

00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:10,710
it's gonna have a completely different

00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:12,780
one so no ok what's this one there's a

00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,890
final one here it's called canvas

00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,880
blocker oh yeah that's one of my

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,850
favorites so the web has become a

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,040
fantastically interactive resource right

00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:24,420
you can do multimedia there's actually

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,920
yesterday there was a presentation

00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,680
though this morning was a presentation

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,780
another mini conf about real-time audio

00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,390
generation in your browser your browser

00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,600
is at the same time as it is a sketching

00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,490
pad it's also a mixer module and it's a

00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,800
speaker and it's a microphone and it's

00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,230
I've got a camera and everything all of

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,310
these things can be used to identify you

00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:50,100
as a matter of fact this browser leaks

00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:53,220
website has a module in there that can

00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,920
with I don't know a very high level of

00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,550
accuracy identify you according to the

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,870
white noise that your microphone

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,530
introduces into the browser stream even

00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:07,680
though you haven't given a permission so

00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,900
this is another extension that I choose

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,150
to enable which basically adds some

00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,620
random white noise on top of that again

00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:17,880
making it different for every single

00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:20,070
request and to make it harder for those

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,150
people out there to track because I

00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,460
value my privacy

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:27,390
I want to value I want to use the web

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:31,230
for the amazing resource that it is but

00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:34,590
I'm stepping up the web against the

00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:37,410
privacy violating trackers out there and

00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,890
if they want to keep up tracking me and

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,019
making sure that they

00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,750
can monetize my data they're going to

00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:45,910
have to step up their game as well after

00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:48,190
I installed all these extensions so

00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,200
that's all I have time for to show to

00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,789
you today we do have time for another

00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,289
five minutes for questions I believe so

00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:55,570
let's go for that and thank you very

00:37:53,289 --> 00:38:02,950
much for your attention

00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:06,400
[Applause]

00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:08,619
in my case should I use the private

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:15,220
browsing feature or should I use your

00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:17,589
method I think you should use my method

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,089
I'm rather than the private browsing

00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,529
feature because the private browsing

00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:23,170
feature is really a feature that

00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:24,970
protects you from your boss it makes

00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,440
sure that your history file is not being

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,940
updated that the bookmarks are not

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,029
accessible and all these kind of things

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,619
but it is actually not to the best of my

00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:35,890
knowledge not something that's outward

00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:38,380
facing so even in a private window even

00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:41,319
though you are sort of like isolated

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:48,730
from your work for instance while you go

00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:50,230
and look at cats right it'll still push

00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,569
all of these states are out there it'll

00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:57,460
still reach out to 79 third-party sites

00:38:52,569 --> 00:39:00,940
while you're surfing that web site um

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,829
quite a number of sites say we detect

00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,519
you using an ad blocker you know you

00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:07,930
can't proceed till you turn it back on

00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:12,750
is there an easy way around that to

00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:16,539
leave them not tracking it well I I

00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:18,730
don't want to propagate the use of ad

00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:20,769
blockers first start as I said earlier I

00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,289
mean we do want to make sure that the

00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:26,109
independent media industry has enough

00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:28,420
money to stay independent on the other

00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:30,069
hand it is annoying that yes like the

00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,509
New York Times and some other websites

00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:34,990
they have started introducing these

00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:36,490
windows that overlay the entire site and

00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,769
say basically can you turn off your web

00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,599
you're at tracker there are some really

00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:42,099
good examples of how they're doing

00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:45,910
things right for instance in Germany or

00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:47,650
suit Deutsche title they go through

00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,420
length to explain to you who they're

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,339
giving the data to that's in part

00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,900
probably informed by the GDP are and

00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:55,120
I'll actually allow

00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,220
to make that decision using you matrix

00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,130
for that one site to actually give

00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,540
permission to display ads then there are

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,880
others that are really bad they

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,450
basically say either do this or you

00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,350
can't come here you could file gdpr

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:12,250
violation claims against them because

00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:14,650
according to the gdpr your you must let

00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,510
me use your site whether I give you my

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,190
data or not and otherwise I'm going to

00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:20,860
sue you for up to four percent of your

00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:23,590
turnover but maybe that's not the right

00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,660
way to go about it sometimes sometimes

00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,220
you can go to the dumb editor and simply

00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,190
select that window and click delete and

00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,020
then read the website visit it so that

00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,180
goes in line again with what Serena said

00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,760
I think it hurt security and easy ways

00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,500
around it but in general I mean write a

00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,150
message to them and say look I'm happy

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,790
to pay for you can you please not

00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,260
monetize my data or feed my data to

00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:48,580
third parties I think that's the best

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:50,860
answer I have you mentioned you weren't

00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,990
really a fan of Danish level tracking in

00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,680
tracking blocking but what are your

00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,640
thoughts on using for example a pie hole

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,860
especially in the case where you don't

00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,950
have this kind of control game consoles

00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:05,590
Smart TVs smart fridges or whatever you

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,330
have you got a V no option within the

00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,250
device itself to do any of this so

00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,930
really I believe your only option is

00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,000
something like that do you have any sort

00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:15,280
of thoughts would you use something like

00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,220
it well if it's better than nothing then

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,320
yeah of course I didn't want to say that

00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,120
bns blocking is bad anything anything

00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,820
that steps up the game against these

00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,500
privacy of users is good right I just

00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,350
don't convey their are better tools out

00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,730
there but as you as you said correctly

00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:32,980
the gaming console is not gonna let you

00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:38,590
install your matrix so put Linux on

00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:41,160
there and then I am are you familiar

00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:44,620
with the with projects like the brave

00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,390
browser project and could you comment on

00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:50,140
what do you think they're doing well or

00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:53,560
not well enough I I'm familiar with the

00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,990
existence of the brave browser I've not

00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,030
actually used it to the point where it

00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:59,950
can comfortably answer that question but

00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,360
it's great to see projects like the

00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,730
brave browser out there which are really

00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,140
privacy preserving browsers and I hope

00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,450
that they're going to grow this sort of

00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,490
fine-grained possibility

00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:11,559
maybe even in a way that it's private

00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,619
and secure by default and then they

00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:17,260
figure out really smart ui/ux

00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:19,779
approaches to tapping into your

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,910
preferences figuring out what you really

00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:23,710
are comfortable with because my privacy

00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:27,819
and your privacy then our understandings

00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:31,000
are completely different right Thank You

00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:33,369
Martin one question I have is how long

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,380
does it take you to sort of browse the

00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:37,299
web with all of these layers that you

00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,160
need to sort of manipulate who actually

00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:40,869
get to the content because I feel like

00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,720
the cognitive overload that I have to go

00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:44,799
through just cleaning out everything

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,920
it's just gonna be too much when I

00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:50,700
actually need to just get some work done

00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:54,430
yeah that's a very valid question

00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,859
so I actually come from from no script

00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,450
and request control a lot of people have

00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:00,010
probably used that which we're two

00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,779
extensions where you had to do the same

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,420
thing pretty much for all of the

00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:06,010
websites and it was not intuitive and

00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,990
they had different paradigms of usage

00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,579
and it was a pain and I ended up

00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:11,079
actually not using them anymore and I'm

00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:15,190
just saying temporarily I lie everything

00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:17,230
right and so that's not the goal I find

00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,970
that you matrix is a lot more intuitive

00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:21,579
and it does these two things at the same

00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:24,460
time and then once you if you're

00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:25,779
actually ready to do that to invest some

00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,630
time at the very beginning you can

00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:31,180
benefit from that for a long time so I

00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,799
prefer for my web browsing habits most

00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,809
of the websites I visit are the same

00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:38,710
ones over and over again so having

00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:41,260
installed these preferences once gets me

00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:43,150
the benefits later but yes in

00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,559
preparation of one of my other talks

00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,299
that I'm giving later this week where I

00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:50,079
wanted to do a lot of images and so on

00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:53,079
and so forth yeah I spend a lot of time

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,309
clicking allow this temporarily just in

00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:56,400
order for me to be able to load the

00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:58,450
images and there's actually an issue

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,490
request the feature request for you

00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,529
matrix of mine in there that basically

00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:05,940
lets me assign a key combination to do

00:44:02,529 --> 00:44:09,730
this does that answer your question I

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,529
have a related question so I also have

00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,210
plugins that take me forever to actually

00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:15,520
end up loading a page sufficiently so I

00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,190
can use it if my mom wants to install

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,970
plugins to protect her browser

00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,130
tracking

00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,270
you mentioned earlier that a lot of

00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,130
these you can just install set and

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,380
forget and they give you a good level of

00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,940
security can you comment on what

00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,069
non-technical people can do to protect

00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,230
them very good question thank you Ben so

00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:35,109
the e FF even though they have just

00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:37,060
partnered with a questionable company

00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:39,700
out there and are getting a lot of stuff

00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,740
about that have a website out there

00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:48,220
called Penn optic click which is

00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:49,300
currently not loading also have a an

00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,089
extension out there which is called

00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,650
privacy badger and privacy badger and

00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:55,270
there's another one that I forget the

00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:58,869
name off that is at the at the moment at

00:44:55,270 --> 00:45:01,240
the top of the curated list of privacy

00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:03,609
add-ons in Firefox and that is very

00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,890
similar basically take all of this away

00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:07,510
they say just enable it and we'll be

00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:10,869
will then look at your browsing habits

00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:12,760
and try to figure out what what you like

00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:14,560
and what you don't like and I think that

00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,119
is a fantastic application of machine

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,890
learning that's probably happening in

00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,569
the background and that is what I would

00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,180
install for anybody who doesn't want to

00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:25,180
be dealing with matrices and

00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:27,520
configuration but for me personally and

00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,339
probably most of you in the room I do

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,859
like to be in control of that matrix

00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:36,510
rather than have machine learning decide

00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:36,510
what I consider private and what not

00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:41,319
alright well on which note I'm going to

00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,119
have used that opportunity to ask the

00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:45,990
last question we are going to lunch but

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,990
