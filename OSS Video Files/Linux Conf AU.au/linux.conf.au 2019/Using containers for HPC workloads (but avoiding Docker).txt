Containers are the old hot thing. But their adoption in all realms of IT is far from widespread. Most containers we see in the wild today are created to host daemon-type processes and scale them massively, but traditional HPC workloads are different and so HPC shops continue to have some aversion to them.

In this short talk I will discuss some of the challenges that Docker introduces when it comes to using containers in a multi-tenant HPC cluster, and what are some of the possible solutions. We will also explore the relationship between containers and reproducibility in Computational Science.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
