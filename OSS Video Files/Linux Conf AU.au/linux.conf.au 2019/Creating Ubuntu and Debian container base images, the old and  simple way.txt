Containers are everywhere, but do you know how to create the root filesystems that they use? There are simple tools available to create your own custom Ubuntu or Debian root filesystem. By using these tools to build environments matching your needs, you will end up with a better understanding of how containers are built - and how to debug them - as well as gain access to more options that can speed up your own builds and testing.

In this presentation, I will show the debootstrap and multistrap tools and provide worked examples on how to avoid their gotchas and end up with a bootable root filesystem.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
