Oracle Public Cloud DevOps development uses a Continuous 
Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow for OpenStack 
development.  This talk will provide an overview of the Oracle Public 
Cloud CI/CD workflow and tools used in our DevOps practice, and our 
experiences with these tools.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
