From simple shell pipelines through more advanced query & workflow systems basic toolmaking is one of the most valuable ways to increase the efficiency of operations work.

In this presentation we look at toolmaking in other fields, and how to best scale toolmaking work to keep the efficiency wins going.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
