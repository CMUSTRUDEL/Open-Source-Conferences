Releasing your software into production can be an exciting time for your team. If everything goes well, you will get inevitable production incidents and support requests from your customers! Congratulations! It is a good sign, your system is being used.
If things go really well, you may find that the velocity of your team is slowing down and maybe you firefighting too much, instead of improving your product and delivering new functionality.

Having a recent experience of establishing operational support model within a development team, I would like to share some guidelines we developed when writing operational runbooks for our product.

In this talk, I will cover industry accepted standards around operational runbooks, why should we write them, when, what should go in there, how detailed do you need to be, how to keep them up to date etc.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

welcome Lana I'm sweet Lana um I'm a

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,059
software developer I have been working

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,210
like that for over ten years and I love

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:22,769
writing documentation as much as any

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,600
other engineer today we had a nice talk

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,670
in the morning about how to be kind to

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,070
yourself at 3:00 a.m. in the morning it

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,230
was a nice talk about operational

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,050
support from an operational support

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,270
person of you so I'd like to talk about

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,410
similar things from a developer

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,750
perspective for that let's remind

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,149
ourselves what is actually a software

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,149
development process I'm pretty sure you

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,480
know that better than me so it all

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,219
starts from from a team well actually

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,739
now I'm lying it's own it all starts

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,170
from from a problem you have a problem

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,260
and you have a team teams go to

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,329
stakeholders experts to talk about this

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,830
problem and and team tries to understand

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,950
what what is it that we are trying to

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,260
solve once we have across once we

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,570
understand a little bit ok ok let's

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,540
let's go back to our dungeon and let's

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,060
hug together something and done deploy

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,570
to production boom and that's it that's

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,159
that's the whole process more less a bit

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,390
more details too bad but it's not

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,360
important

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,909
once we are in production what happens

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,619
is we get our customers we get our

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,020
customers and they start using our

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,850
application and this is great this is

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,759
great because we finally get our

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,220
feedback we finally trying to improve

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,290
the product we're developing we trying

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,590
to make it better make the world a

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,509
better place it's great

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,549
however at the same time we get some

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,439
sort of weird and annoying production

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,649
incidents well I kind of know web server

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,200
is down or the response time from our

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,180
server is really slow or we can't save

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,070
the changes customer making or we're

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,530
losing the data or we can't talk to our

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,020
dependencies a little bit annoying but

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,289
we have to like drop everything we have

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,930
to drop everything and fix it and at

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,630
some point we realize that we try to

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,490
develop

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,890
our product we try to improve it we're

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,080
trying to make it better and better but

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,090
we don't have much time because most of

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,880
the time we have production incidents

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,850
and we just like drop everything and

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,610
firefighting and that's a bit annoying

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,840
because in most of the cases production

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,400
incidents they don't actually require a

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,960
firefighting sometimes it's a little bit

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,780
of a fire and it's okay so at this point

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,410
of time at this point of time we as a

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,970
development team we want to think about

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,280
okay maybe we need some sort of rational

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,100
support model and we need to think about

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,660
it like how we can deal with the

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,390
production incidents who's been a

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,190
response to that and things like that

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,500
and at the same time maybe we should

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,580
write some sort of documentation and

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,800
call it operational and book so at this

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,050
point of time I'd like to share our

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,920
experience of actually writing this

00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:18,640
document where we started and it's good

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,560
to start with the with the timeline it's

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,740
a typical timeline of a production

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,840
incident let's say you have a page of

00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,910
duty or any other alert system you're

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,700
using and you received an alert that

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,770
your web server is slow that response

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:37,540
time is less than I don't know 60

00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:40,150
milliseconds right next thing happens is

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,010
Anna who is on production support tree

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,440
and knowledge she receives this alert

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,780
and just like yep I received that let me

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,690
check what's happening so the next thing

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,110
is what she does is she's like okay let

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,820
me check the locks dashboards monitoring

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:58,540
metrics we have and try to understand

00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,820
what just happened right so this is the

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,130
initial response this is something that

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,890
you have to do regardless of the

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,590
severity of the production incident

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,630
regardless of the impact of the incident

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,709
this is just initial response trying to

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:17,320
analyze okay what what the impact what

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,810
is the impact and to support this kind

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,660
of initial response product in terms of

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:26,260
documentation what you need to have is

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,160
maybe just some simple page describing

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,420
okay this

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,700
my expected alert alert type and this is

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,470
some links to investigate the problem

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,230
and in terms of links what you want to

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,410
put is this is the link to my dashboards

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:44,410
dashboards of my infrastructure this is

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,990
my CPU metrics memory this is some

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,320
business metrics at the same time with

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,080
what we found useful is having here

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,940
links to our log aggregation systems

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,570
like I don't know what they use like

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,030
cloud Watchers Splunk or sumo logic it's

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,030
always nice to put the actual queries

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,430
against the logs so when incident

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,080
happened you kind of stress I don't know

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,970
have you ever been on production support

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,500
it's it's stressful all you want to do

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,590
is like hide somewhere in the corner and

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,900
cry and everyone is keep asking hey hey

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:21,580
when isn't going to fix when when isn't

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:24,790
gonna be fixed well I don't know so

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:29,140
having queries and having this kind of

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:31,600
help to find what's happening is really

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,540
useful so this is the minimum thing

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,190
required for documentation for initial

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,000
response to the production incident

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,100
right so what happened next

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,810
is you need to think about these things

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:49,450
like impact expectations and SLA impact

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,930
is how many customers actually been

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:55,240
affected by the production incident what

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,280
are the expectations of these customers

00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,200
are your customers expecting your

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,850
service to be available full time are

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,370
they expecting it to be available

00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,040
overnight are they expecting it to be

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,420
available every minute of every hour so

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,370
these are the things you need to

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,190
communicate with the customers before

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,100
providing production support because

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,860
based on the expectations you can also

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,870
document it in this thing called service

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,770
level agreement anyone heard about this

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,720
document yeah so this is this is just a

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,300
documentation about the expectations of

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,610
your customers how often is your service

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,280
up was the availability criterias what

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,110
is the expected response time who are

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,479
the contact people

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,640
if something happens where do I see the

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,860
list of existing incidents and things

00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,780
like that

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,970
so once you initially response to

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,310
respond to the incident what you want to

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,010
check what you want to validate and

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,380
estimate is the actual impact because

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,570
based on the impact based on the

00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:00,370
severity of this impact what you want to

00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:04,450
do next is either nothing or actually

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,880
damage control so in the case of Ana's

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:09,910
incident she she wasn't really lucky so

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,340
she she probably has to investigate

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,700
because webserver is done right but the

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:19,300
first thing she does is the impact is

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,900
quite high in her case so she wants to

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,640
send an email to the stakeholders and

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,200
this is really important communication

00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,450
to the customers in terms of production

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,810
and systems is really important because

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,670
this is the trust even if you have an

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,280
incident with him like I don't know five

00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,550
five minutes and you were able to

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,290
restore the services up again it's very

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,180
important to communicate it back to the

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:48,040
customers because this is your trust so

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,650
in terms of communication again let's go

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,930
back to that the operational runbook we

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,690
have under type and some sort of helped

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,060
investigate it and along with that it's

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,120
always nice to have a list of

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,980
communication required what what are the

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,960
emails I need to send what are the

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,690
addresses of emails I need to send email

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,160
to who are my stakeholders when doing it

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,100
when do I need to send this

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,740
communication and which channels should

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,650
I use and things like that so when

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,440
incident happened it happens you don't

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,630
go to your manager asking hey where

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,210
should I actually who are our customers

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:30,640
and who should I communicate about our

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:33,340
server not being available right so

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,040
after after understands this email to

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,660
the stakeholders she actually does a

00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,169
little bit of investigation and she

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,540
finds out the the cause of the issue

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,370
what is the cause of the issue in her

00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,760
case the cause of the issue was just the

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:52,000
latest commit right the latest commit so

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,160
what she does is she does the damage

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,370
control of that right

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,510
in terms of helping her out with

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,540
investigation and finding out the cause

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,460
of the issue along with the

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,040
communication we also want to have a

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,320
round book and round book is just it's

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,320
just a step-by-step guide on what to do

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,440
and what I mean is okay ssh to this box

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,890
maybe log into the server check this

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,660
looks around this come on this is how

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,840
you restart the process this is how you

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,490
stop the process or maybe do nothing

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:32,940
maybe because it's automatically

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:35,890
resolved issue so once you discover the

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,290
cause of the incident all you want to do

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,980
is a damage control you don't want to

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:44,590
spend another week trying to solve and

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,530
find the root cause of it because all

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:51,070
you have to do is a minimum thing a

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,930
minimum thing required to actually fix

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,500
this incident and make things normal

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,910
again so this is again a firefighting I

00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,680
call it a firefighting I don't know

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,290
maybe you call it something else but for

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,390
me it is a hockey is minimum thing

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,970
required to make things normal again

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,010
so once you do this thing all you want

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,230
to do is send an email to your

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,900
stakeholders again say hey I just saved

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:17,080
the day everything works everything is

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,090
fine the issue is still not resolved but

00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,430
we are looking at that and this is the

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,290
reference to our ticket number and we

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,440
will contact you in the next two days

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,580
with the resolution it's very important

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,470
again to communicate with the

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:35,290
stakeholders because this is a trust and

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,690
after this this is done you can you can

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,240
breathe in again you can like relax and

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,940
do a proper investigation of this

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,770
production incident right and in this

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,700
case I don't think there should be some

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:50,470
sort of very in comprehensive

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,260
documentation on how to do that because

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,090
this depends on the incident all you

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,190
want to do okay you already have logs

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,080
you already have dashboards and metrics

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,880
you would probably have a look at the

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,900
court and try to understand why this is

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,510
happening and things like that so in the

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,080
case of our incident Anna finds out the

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,330
fine

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,670
the root cause of the issue which is

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,070
probably some sort of extra dependency

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,110
introduced in the latest commit and this

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,570
dependency is down and that causes some

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,500
problems with our application and this

00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:25,000
is not acceptable so what does she do

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,000
she doesn't fix the issue straight away

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,519
what she does is she raises an incident

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,300
an issue with the development team

00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,610
letting them know hey hey team there is

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,700
some sort of issue it causes a problem

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,959
in production should we fix it and then

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,970
development teams should actually

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,910
prioritize that against their current

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,670
work because we don't want to go to this

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,490
position again when a fire fight we will

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,260
approach this issue against the work we

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,820
are doing right now and check maybe

00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:00,040
maybe we're working on something which

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:02,380
is actually more important right and the

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,130
last thing the last thing after all of

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,620
this is done Ana organizes a post

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,510
incident review and post this incident

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:14,290
review this is just my favorite meeting

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,190
I can't wait to hold it with Maya this

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,500
is gonna be great

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,130
me am I actually gonna work some

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,050
together so post incident review you can

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,320
actually have another talk about post

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,970
incident review and like how to help

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,100
hold this meeting and what we need to

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,230
talk about but in terms of this

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,500
documentation what's important here is

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:39,190
one of the things we talked about on PIR

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,680
meetings a gaps are gaps which are

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,380
identified during the production

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,660
incident some of the gaps in the process

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,570
or some of the gaps in the documentation

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,870
or some of the gaps in the alerts some

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,670
of the alerts maybe are too noisy and

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,220
maybe you want to tune them maybe change

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,910
the threshold or change the severity of

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,680
this alerts maybe you don't have enough

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,990
documentation in the operational run-run

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,730
book on what to do or maybe you didn't

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,560
have access to some of the systems to

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,510
fix it that's another thing with the

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,730
peroration of support you have to have

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:15,730
access to the things if you are on a

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,279
professional support so post incident

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,829
review is another important and

00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,940
essential step which helps us to keep

00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:23,830
our documentation

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,560
today because the result of

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:29,620
post-incident review are the action

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,460
items which are targeted on updating the

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:38,110
documentation and hero this is the

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:40,210
circle of life this is just a summary of

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,070
what we just talked about it all starts

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,650
with the incidents and when we analyze

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,480
the impact communicate with the

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,460
stakeholders with trying to damage

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,410
control it we're trying to make it

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,590
normal again and then we and then only

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:56,440
then we take our time to analyze it and

00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:02,110
find the root cause and then we're

00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:11,380
improving the current process and that's

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:11,680
it thank you excellent thank you very

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,200
much

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,910
and in fact do you have time for some

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,880
questions if you're happy to take a

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:35,140
couple if we have some questions oh not

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:39,910
everyone that wants how often do people

00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:42,970
ignore all this documentation I think

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,790
people do ignore documentation but not

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,430
this one on my current project what I've

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,950
noticed it's this documentation is one

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,340
of the most important one because when

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:57,610
things are going wrong it's just yeah

00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,700
it's way easier to go to see a page

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:05,170
instead of actually interrupt your

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:09,400
developers but yeah the rest of the

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:12,310
documentation is completely ignored so

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,750
what's your strategy for finding the

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,720
right answer in the documentation

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,990
especially in a big project for people

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,120
that are operational and stressed you

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,250
mean in terms of okay there is a how to

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,660
find the right answer and the steps to

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:31,170
follow in the in the accident so usually

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,270
usually you when you set up your alerts

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,680
let's say use New Relic or pages duty or

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,529
cloud watch

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,650
when you send us alerts notifications

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:43,870
channels email or page duty or phone

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,290
usually attach a reference to around

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:49,029
book yeah and that's that's actually

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,490
that's what Katie was talking about as

00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,040
well 3:00 a.m. you wake up you get a

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,650
notification about something not working

00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:14,380
and with this notification you have a

00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:17,230
reference to a book I how do you keep

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:20,050
those post-incident review meetings

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:24,010
civil like I've been in a few that have

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:29,589
gone pretty yeah nasty we usually follow

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:31,600
my advices but yeah that's a good

00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,120
question I think there are some

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,040
templates on how to run it and before

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,710
that it's kind of like a retrospective

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,220
as well we set up the context saying

00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:45,370
that it's a no blame meeting it's no

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:58,120
one's fault and we're not here to blame

00:16:45,370 --> 00:17:00,459
people we're here to improve things I'd

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,830
like to know how you get people to

00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:05,050
actually create and maintain the

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:09,309
documentation that's been my biggest

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:12,429
issue so we started our production

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:15,010
support without documentation and we

00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:19,660
started to write entities based on the

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:22,089
incidents it was hard it was really hard

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,689
for me as well I think it was just the

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:28,030
team the team around me who who were

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,230
disciplined enough to write something in

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,670
a confluence after the incident happened

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:36,520
let's say you actually make time for it

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,050
after an incident occurs so yes we're

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,780
definitely account for production

00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,970
support we have let's say six developers

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,600
and one person on a full-time production

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,600
support

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,870
all right well please join me in
