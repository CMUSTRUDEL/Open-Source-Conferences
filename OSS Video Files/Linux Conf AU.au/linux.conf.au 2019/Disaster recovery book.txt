Releasing your software into production can be an exciting time for your team. If everything goes well, you will get inevitable production incidents and support requests from your customers! Congratulations! It is a good sign, your system is being used.
If things go really well, you may find that the velocity of your team is slowing down and maybe you firefighting too much, instead of improving your product and delivering new functionality.

Having a recent experience of establishing operational support model within a development team, I would like to share some guidelines we developed when writing operational runbooks for our product.

In this talk, I will cover industry accepted standards around operational runbooks, why should we write them, when, what should go in there, how detailed do you need to be, how to keep them up to date etc.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
