Clockwork is a language to describe how machines should behave. It was developed specifically to reduce the risk and cost of custom programming of short-run machines without loss of flexibility. Over several decades we have built custom machines and have built control systems using a variety of technologies, including: Z80 controller boards, C++ control software under Linux and a variety of PLC's. These technologies have had their strengths and weaknesses but overall we have found that Clockwork and its associated tools has far greater re-usability and lower per-machine development overhead than anything else we have tried. The language itself is not like other programming languages and this talk is about how we program in Clockwork.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
