and without further ado I would like to

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:11,660
introduce Donna Lewis who is someone

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,010
that we've all been waiting eagerly to

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:19,439
hear from and she has a fascinating

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,630
journey to tell us about and I am really

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,720
looking forward to hearing what she has

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,820
to tell us about how open-source is

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,650
changing healthcare so I give you Donna

00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,650
[Applause]

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,280
good morning everyone thank you for

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,020
being so awake and excited I'm not sure

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,600
I'm as awake as you are but mobile maybe

00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,790
by the end of this we'll change that I

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,380
want to start by telling you about my

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,970
journey to learning about open source

00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,890
how I apply it to healthcare and I'm

00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,480
hoping you leave thinking about how you

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,160
might apply some of your skills to

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,710
healthcare but I want to point out

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,820
something first that you probably think

00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,580
that there are two kinds of people in

00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,690
the room those who appreciate binary

00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,150
jokes and those who do not

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,470
but as relevant for this talk there's

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,720
actually two different kinds of people

00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,520
in their own those who naturally produce

00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,710
their own insulin which is most of you

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
and those of us who do not because we

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,420
have type 1 diabetes and I'm one of

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,250
those people with type 1 diabetes but we

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,720
start to talk about healthcare whether

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,330
you're coming from the tech perspective

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,420
or the healthcare perspective it is very

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,040
very common to think that it's easy you

00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,200
know with type 1 diabetes you don't make

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,899
insulin so just inject it test your

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,759
blood sugar eat healthy exercise who

00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,990
here does that who listens to their

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,430
doctor when they say eat healthy and

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,709
exercise I saw hand-raise good for you

00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,240
but for most of us it's harder than that

00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:42,250
and with type 1 diabetes it's really

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,450
hard and the other thing to remember is

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,270
when you're diagnosed with a chronic

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,039
disease type 1 diabetes you get cancer

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,810
you find out your child has cystic

00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,580
fibrosis you name it it's really hard

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,280
because it's like getting struck by

00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,220
lightning you have no chance to prepare

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,649
you have no idea it's coming you just

00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,149
know from that moment on everything is

00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,289
gonna be really really different and you

00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:04,539
have to figure it out

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,490
in the case of type 1 diabetes part of

00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,590
the reason it's so hard is because it's

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,899
not just insulin and food and exercise

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,420
in your body there's things like stress

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,800
and excitement and adrenaline so for

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,510
example right now I'm really stressed

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,190
and excited and you know I'll jammed up

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,310
to talk with y'all and my blood Sugar's

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,020
going up and that's hard to measure how

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,280
do you dose insulin for the excitement

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,709
of staring at a room full of people

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,720
really early in a different time zone

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,340
it's kind of hard to do and there's also

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,750
the confusing fact that some things that

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,550
make your blood sugar go up sometimes

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,220
will also make your blood sugar go down

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,480
sometimes so that's why when you look at

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,040
a line of a blood sugar graph of a

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,450
person with type 1 diabetes it's very

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,950
easy to look at that and judge and say

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,780
wow they're doing a bad job or they're

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,280
out of control or just any kind of snap

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,170
judgement but the reality is there are

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,030
so many non-measurable things that

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,220
influence your blood sugar and the

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,160
insulin is not this instantaneous magic

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,290
drug it's great it keeps us alive but it

00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,360
takes 60 to 90 minutes to peek into your

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,490
body so if I see my blood sugar going up

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,500
right now and I choose to dose myself

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,300
some insulin it will take upwards of an

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,430
hour for it to really kick in and start

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,380
to manage that blood sugar and the

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,989
kicker is food hits your body in about

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,040
15 minutes so can you imagine sitting

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,140
down to eat something

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,120
deciding to eat eating dosing your

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,530
insulin the food kicks in in 15 minutes

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,360
and you go up and up and up but it takes

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,370
45 to 60 minutes before your blood sugar

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,870
starts to come down that's why the graph

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,269
looks like that and that's why diabetes

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,160
is so hard and a lot of us are fortunate

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,290
to have access to some tools that help

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,069
it access to insulin is not a guarantee

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,930
around the world

00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:34,550
so getting access to insulin number one

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,530
we're very very lucky for most of us to

00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,300
be able to do that we also have some

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,340
tools like a continuous glucose monitor

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,569
in an insulin pump those sound great

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,100
instead of having to inject yourself

00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:44,269
multiple times a day you've got

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,069
something clipped on your hip

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,590
that will infuse into insulin into your

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,000
body on a regular basis and a continuous

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,070
glucose monitor that'll tell you your

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,799
blood sugar every five minutes what more

00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,420
could you possibly want well the

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,709
challenge is with what I call manual

00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,540
diabetes with a setup that I just

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,700
described you have to do a lot of work

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,230
you have to pull the receiver out of

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,730
your pocket press a button look at the

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,410
number look at the trend of what's

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,000
happening you have to pull out your

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,670
insulin pump and see what has been dosed

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,890
win how long etcetera you have to decide

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,360
what am i doing am i eating and my

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,829
exercising am i giving a talk what I'm

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,720
gonna have to do and you have to make a

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:20,510
decision and decide to dose more or less

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,520
insulin or eat and do that over and over

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,410
and over and over and over again

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,390
throughout the day an average person

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,039
with type 1 diabetes makes hundreds of

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,660
decisions a day that affects their blood

00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,610
sugar it's not always about dosing

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,220
insulin but choosing to eat or not to

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,169
eat what exactly you eat or when to

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,570
exercise or do I need to eat a snack

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,130
before I go it's a lot of work and it's

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,660
really really hard and that's why it's

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,010
very common to see graphs of a

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,020
continuous glucose monitor that looks

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,970
like this and the reason I show you this

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,410
particular screenshot is because it's

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,740
also very hard as a person with diabetes

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,510
to get your data off these devices in

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,039
2013 my endocrinologist said hey can you

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,110
bring in a week's worth of your data and

00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,360
I said okay sure and I went away and I

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,020
was like wait a second the FDA approved

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,629
software for

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,810
my medical device only works for PC and

00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:07,870
I have a Mac what am I supposed to do

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,759
can't get my data off my device it is

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,169
incredibly frustrating the other key

00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,310
problem with the devices is that they're

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,539
dumb and they don't talk to each other

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,430
because they're made by different

00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:18,020
manufacturers and in healthcare you

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,580
don't expect different manufacturers to

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,870
play nice with one another so these

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,460
devices are done they don't talk to each

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,590
other so that leaves me as the human in

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,840
the middle making all of you decisions

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,789
doing all of this work and even more

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,490
importantly I have a special superhuman

00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:34,130
treat that probably tops all of you I am

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,080
the world's best sleeper I will sleep

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,849
long and hard and I will ignore every

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,470
alarm in existence including the one of

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,909
my medical device because it's been

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,610
making the same alarm that I can't

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,199
change for five years so there's

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,479
something called alarm fatigue where you

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,919
get really you know used to hearing it

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,750
and your body stops paying attention to

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,370
it so I would sleep through the alarm on

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,949
this so this is designed that if my

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,210
blood sugar does go low to alarm but if

00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,639
you're sleeping and you don't hear it

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,319
the pump is still giving you insulin and

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,560
you're just gonna go lower and lower and

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,120
lower so that led to a very terrible

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,849
scenario for me where I was afraid to go

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,229
to sleep at night can you imagine going

00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,750
to sleep and worrying that you're not

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:12,740
going to wake up alive the next morning

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,690
that's what it's like for a lot of us

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,520
with type 1 diabetes it's not just ok we

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,800
have to do a lot of work we are at risk

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,020
of dying every single day because even

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,639
if you do everything right your body

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,990
reacts to exercise differently so if you

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,060
run a marathon you might be sensitive

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,469
for multiple days afterwards so even if

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,699
you do everything right you take your

00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:30,380
insulin you count your carbs you eat

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,599
healthy you exercise you do everything

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,340
they say it is still possible that you

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:36,680
can die in the short term and in the

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,860
long term with diabetes that's really

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,740
incredibly frustrating and back in 2013

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,060
and 2014 I got so fed up with the fact

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,520
that I couldn't even change the lousy

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,159
alarm on this thing but I had an idea if

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,419
we can't change this what if we could

00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,770
design a system that would solve the

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,050
problem what if we could make our own

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,340
louder alarms we could take the data off

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,169
the device run it through the cloud down

00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,719
to my phone my phone will wake me up but

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:02,630
wait how do I get the data off my device

00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:05,690
I couldn't and so I was stuck but that

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,370
changed in 2013 I actually found

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,159
somebody on Twitter a gentleman named

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,779
John caustic who posted a photo of one

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:13,030
of these receivers plugged into a phone

00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,110
or computer and

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,330
knowing how it went up to the cloud

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,710
across town and down to his computer at

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,780
work so he could see his sons blood

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,340
sugar from afar and the light bulb

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,680
really went off I was like oh if he

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,210
would share his code with me we could

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,880
build my louder alarm system let's do it

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,530
but keep in mind I come from a

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,060
communications background not an

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,160
engineer or programmer by training knew

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,570
nothing about open source so I started

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,550
talking about it with my now husband's

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,930
got librarian and I was like I wonder if

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,490
he'd share his code with us which is

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,140
like a crazy question in this room I

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,000
know but think about everybody who

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,020
doesn't know about open source you don't

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,880
know until you ask

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,090
so yeah since hey would you share this

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,680
with us and he said yes so with his code

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,750
we were able to plug this into an old

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,790
window windows laptop that was sit by my

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,320
bedside at night run the data into

00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,940
Dropbox every five minutes up to the

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,250
cloud use an app called push over to

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,620
send an alarm down to my phone it worked

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,750
so well I think in the first month I had

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,250
something like 200 alarms that I

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,500
actually heard and woke up to it was

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,910
fantastic but we decided to do other

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,080
things too once we pulled the data off

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,060
we could do all kinds of really cool

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,980
things we built a very simple ugly

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,480
terrible-looking dashboard that was

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,710
terribly effective because even at 3

00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,810
o'clock in the morning if my blood sugar

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,640
was 50 I could read that and see here

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,020
what's my blood sugar is here's what

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,150
it's going to be and here's what action

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,470
I need to take now my loved ones were a

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,270
little concerned that if I wake up and

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,500
my blood sugar was low I might do kind

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,520
of the opposite thing that I should be

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,230
doing because when your blood Sugar's

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,730
low your brain is kind of weird so that

00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,320
we put buttons on the system so I could

00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,730
say here's what I'm doing I'm eating I'm

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,280
taking more insulin I'm taking less

00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,020
insulin and we also decided that the

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,120
point of this display was not for them

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,010
to be my primary caregivers I'm an adult

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,720
I can handle myself I wanted them to be

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,790
my secondary line of defense if I did

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,980
not wake up to the alarm then it should

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,450
alarm them so ideally it would alarm I'd

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,070
wake up and I'd press the button that

00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,960
would essentially snooze the system and

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,030
say don't wake everybody else up it was

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,550
great and we jokingly called the system

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,780
DIY PS that do-it-yourself pancreas

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,430
system and I thought it was the best

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,230
thing since sliced bread because it

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,280
would pull data off this device it would

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,780
tell me what was going to happen

00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,690
give me prompts about actions to take

00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,490
what more could you possibly want so

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,540
because we were pulling all this data in

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,670
and because I was the world's best

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,650
guinea pig at pressing the button every

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,570
time I did something we had all the data

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,650
you could possibly need to predict into

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,180
the future what was going to happen

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,830
based on the insula and the food that I

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,050
was eating and anything else that was

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,130
happening but within a year we started

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,779
talking with other

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,250
I was so enamored with this idea of open

00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,810
source of people freely sharing with

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,610
others I was like we have to share our

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,959
solution because I know I'm not the only

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,180
one who's afraid to go to sleep at night

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,620
I know I'm not the only one who sleeps

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,959
through their alarms it's a very very

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,459
common problem with type 1 diabetes so

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,779
as we talk to other people we learn

00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,730
different things about what you could do

00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:47,649
with open source we learned that the FDA

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,899
frowns on distributing code that looks

00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,269
like a medical device even if it's not a

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,880
medical device and so we actually didn't

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:56,290
share our first initial system but along

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,610
the way we started meeting different

00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,649
people who were doing different cool

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,720
open-source things and diabetes we met

00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,310
this awesome guy named bin West who had

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,529
spent years figuring out how to talk to

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,390
the insulin pump well a very particular

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,730
type of insulin pump and it turns out

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,529
that was an insulin pump I had and the

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,120
light bulb went off again that we

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,310
actually had everything that we needed

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,350
in our pockets relatively speaking in

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,209
the household to build a closed loop

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,000
artificial pancreas system because you

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:24,190
take that same dumb CGM that you plug in

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,260
and that same dumb pump that you could

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,120
talk to now thanks to Ben's work and you

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,040
plug in a small Linux machine in our

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,329
case it was a Raspberry Pi a little

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,339
radio stick to talk to the pump and a

00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:35,770
battery and you end up with a closed

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:37,779
loop artificial pancreas system and why

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,220
the system matters this looks big this

00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,560
looks clunky but remember what we did in

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,839
manual diabetes human doing everything

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,820
hundred times a day that's not a job for

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,800
a human to read data off one machine and

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,930
from another and process it and then

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,260
take a small action that is a job for a

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,480
computer so you take that CGM talk to a

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,430
computer take the pump make it talk to

00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,020
the computer and you make it make the

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,790
decisions every five minutes based on

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,990
the change in blood sugar that's how you

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,089
get a closed loop artificial pancreas

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,709
system and the human can still intervene

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,180
this human can still do whatever they

00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,279
want make good decisions bad decisions

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,029
whatever but the computer is there in

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,860
the background

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,360
monitoring making small decisions and

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,190
reacting much more quickly than the

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,240
human could whether you're awake and

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,470
just not paying attention because you're

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,520
talking to a roomful of people you're

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,220
working you're chasing your kids

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,720
whatever or you're sleeping again the

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,130
primary goal there so what does the

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,970
closed loop artificial pancreas system

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,070
look like today

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,329
it looks like this and if you see me

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,920
walking around you may not even notice

00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,839
mine unless you notice the little red

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,250
light on mine this is an open-source

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,199
Hardware board that's what's pictured on

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,020
screen on the backside is an Intel

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:39,579
Edison as well as my pump my CGM and

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,510
then an open-source visualization tool

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,920
we call night scout

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,810
where you can see what the blood sugar

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,160
is doing it's a little purple line as

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,750
the predictions which is telling the

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,339
system here's what the blood sugar is

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,449
going to do it decides how much insulin

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,399
to give and then the blue lines

00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:53,649
oscillating are more and less insulin

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,940
compared to my baseline so how does this

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,529
work for those of you without diabetes

00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,449
remember the grass before looks

00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,139
something like this within the first

00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:00,880
week

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:12,579
overnight my blood Sugar's started

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:17,949
looking like this and the reason this

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:19,810
matters so this was four years ago now

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,760
imagine this week we flew over from the

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,529
United States we did Seattle to SFO to

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,510
Oakland to here and SFO to Oakland is a

00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,740
very long flight about 13 hours and I

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,480
got about five hours of sleep which

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,649
meant that I was a little sleep deprived

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,130
I usually like about nine and a half

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,430
hours so Tuesday night when we went to

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,110
sleep

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,470
or sorry Monday night we went to sleep I

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,350
slept for 13 hours and this is what my

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,670
blood Sugar's dead no worries no

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,920
concerns it didn't matter how

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,750
sleep-deprived I am what time zone I'm

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,130
in what did I was waking up when I went

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,810
to bed what I had for dinner what was

00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,769
going on in the world lunar eclipse

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:55,389
doesn't matter I don't have to worry so

00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,279
that is the beauty of this system but

00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:59,050
remember I was helped by multiple people

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,389
along the way when we built the system I

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,130
didn't want to keep it to myself and I

00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:05,529
didn't feel epically like I could

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,149
because it was so impactful so we

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,819
decided to open source this project and

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:12,040
that's why we call it open aps the open

00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,720
source artificial pancreas system and it

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,100
was this idea of a movement more than a

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,870
particular project it wasn't about the

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,819
hardware it wasn't about the pump but it

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,850
was this idea of hey we can make really

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:23,350
safe and effective basic artificial

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,750
pancreas systems and we want to do

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,610
everything we can to help anybody who

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,380
wants to do this be able to do so

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,819
anywhere in the world and help them

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,550
reduce their burden of living with type

00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:36,010
1 diabetes it's not a cure but it makes

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,870
a huge difference in quality of life so

00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,970
we decided to open source this and one

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,350
of the first things that we did so in

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,149
might when I first bought my smart alarm

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,410
system what was essentially an open loop

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,269
system because it would tell me what to

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,769
do and I would take the action we didn't

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,870
really sell realized at the time it was

00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,399
an open loop but we spent so much time

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,230
working on the algorithm we really

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,190
understood how it worked so we first

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,160
wrote on plainly

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,569
here all the ways that it works and here

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,480
more importantly are all the ways it's

00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:02,829
going to fail not if it fails when it

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,470
fails these are the ways that we know

00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:07,060
it's going to fail because you are going

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,139
to rip your pump side out or if you're

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,819
like me when I was going between

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,259
Auckland and Christchurch my backpack

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,180
caught my continuous glucose monitor

00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,589
sensor and partially ripped it out and

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,149
you have to be prepared of what if you

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:17,589
lose the sensor data the glucose data

00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:19,600
that goes into the system what if you

00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,670
can't dose the insulin what if the

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,470
battery on your rig or your pancreas

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,970
dies what if the battery on your pump

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,649
dies and turns off the radio

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,389
communications what if you run out of

00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,920
insulin there are so many ways that this

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,870
thing is going to fail and we pretty

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,920
much designed for those and it's really

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,149
interesting when we talk with people

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,470
from kind of traditional healthcare

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,790
they're like oh what if what if would

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,620
have and at the end of the conversation

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,519
we say well here's our design and here's

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,339
all the ways we know what's going to

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,540
fail they're like wow you spent a lot of

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:52,600
time thinking about safety yes yes we

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:54,279
did and the reason we spent so much time

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,230
thinking about safety is because we are

00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:58,060
the people with type 1 diabetes we are

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,069
the people that are diagnosed handed a

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,680
vial of a lethal drug and sent home

00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:03,790
saying good luck that's literally what

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,860
happens when you're diagnosed with type

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,029
1 some people get more or less education

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,709
some people are hospitalized for a

00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,269
couple days but at the end of whatever

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:13,630
little education series you get you go

00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,920
home and it is up to you 99.99% of

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,569
decision making is done by the person

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,980
with diabetes there are very few

00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:20,439
healthcare conditions where that happens

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,420
so people with diabetes they have to

00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,870
figure it out where they don't stay

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,639
alive

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,810
so those of us walking around with type

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,480
1 diabetes have done a lot of

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,399
experimenting a lot of failing but then

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,170
a lot of getting up and trying again so

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,329
when we design the system we of course

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,889
focused on safety but we thought about

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:38,410
what are the limits that we can set on

00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,880
hardware as well as the software you see

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,350
there's a very key part of the story

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,759
that a lot of people especially the tech

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,459
people like to focus on which is the

00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,290
security and the safety of the devices

00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:49,569
wait how are you talking to the pump

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,730
well turns out we're actually using a

00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:53,980
known security hole or flaw that caused

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:57,220
the pump to be recalled off the US

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,589
market so we are using these old

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,759
insecure pumps because the security flaw

00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:02,559
was that you could talk to the pump over

00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,149
the radio well that's what's allows us

00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,100
to talk to the pump over the radio and

00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:08,540
close the loop but because we have heart

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,310
limits on the pump about how much

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,290
insulin you can dose we have software

00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,430
limits that you can set there set very

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,020
conservatively by default when you

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,480
install the open source software

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,710
it starts with basically reduce insulin

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,330
for safety don't give any more unless

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,700
the person says give it more and that

00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,740
person can specify how much more we

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,120
respond to unexpected data like a weird

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,560
flu key data comes in we're not just

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,150
responding to a single data point we

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,830
designed to look at the trend the

00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,570
predictions if you're missing data if

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,740
you get in a common error that we call

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,910
the three question marks where the

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,320
sensor says I'm not giving you any more

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,720
data because something's weird is

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,280
happening we've designed for that but

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,770
the number one thing we designed for is

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,720
we worked with the system it's designed

00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,250
where you get what's called a basal rate

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,150
so kind of your baseline amount of

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,500
insulin throughout the day that's the

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,970
dumb part where if you're gonna go low

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,370
it keeps dosing that baseline amount of

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,930
insulin kind of bad so what we do is we

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,880
send what's called a temporary basal

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,740
rate command that only lasts for 30

00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,300
minutes with the idea that if the system

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,800
is working and it makes another decision

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,110
in five minutes it's gonna send another

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,940
command and overwrite the last 30 minute

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,920
rate but if for some reason the system

00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,030
fills it gets stuck somebody takes it

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,770
and runs away because they're so excited

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,810
about it the battery dies for whatever

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,820
reason you fall back at the end of the

00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:17,030
30 minutes to your pre-programmed gold

00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,740
standard of care insulin pump so you

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,209
fall back to the gold standard if this

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,939
thing breaks and that's how we designed

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,199
it so if you're interested a lot more

00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,730
details about the safety and all the

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,260
design things I'd love to talk about it

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,090
with you if you don't have time to talk

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,770
about it with me here I will point you

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,780
to open ApS org is where we have our

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,310
plain language reference design and I

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,020
emphasize plain language because I used

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,370
to say English then I realized it's not

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,100
actually just the English part that

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,200
matters but it's the plain language

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,060
because we have ever had a lot of people

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,040
over the years who've come in and done

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,110
this project for themselves they're not

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,850
technical people and in fact many people

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,740
take a lot of convincing that they can

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,940
do this that they can try to do this so

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,500
we really emphasize that people should

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,690
start with the plain language reference

00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,980
design because it's written as a person

00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,270
with diabetes for the rest the world

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,250
saying here's how you treat your

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,620
diabetes here's how we taught the

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,840
computer to do the same thing in fact it

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,700
was me teaching my husband here are the

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,430
rules to deal with type 1 diabetes if

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,410
this then that that made us realize we

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,820
could teach the computer it's a lot

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,740
easier to teach a computer than a human

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,770
because the computer will do what you

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,289
tell it to humans get their own ideas

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,850
[Music]

00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:22,259
so anyways the the reference design is a

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,970
great read we also have tons of

00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,950
documentation and code open source of

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,049
course online but I want to point out

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,519
this is not just one person doing this

00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,230
I've been looping now for a little over

00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,789
four years there are actually multiple

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,919
people in this room using closed loop

00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:36,239
artificial pancreas systems but around

00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,070
the world there are over a thousand

00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:40,499
people using different versions of these

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,519
systems and the reason that matters big

00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,690
s there are millions of people around

00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,159
the world of type one diabetes so you

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,690
may look and be like that's nothing my

00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,509
project has you know five billion users

00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,739
that's fine this number surprises me

00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:51,989
because I only thought two or three

00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:53,220
people would end up using this at the

00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:55,259
time we thought everybody would switch

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,149
over to a commercial product if and when

00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,590
it became available because we were just

00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:00,480
filling the gap we said there's nothing

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,070
else out there that will work we're

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,429
gonna do something we're gonna make it

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,749
work for ourselves so it works so well

00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,009
and we've been able to iterate on it

00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:09,539
because it's open source we can just

00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:10,739
keep chipping away the problems we find

00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,899
improvements that we want to make

00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:15,269
hardware software algorithm usability

00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:16,350
features whatever but what's really

00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:18,869
surprised me is that people have

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,159
continued to use this so I asked people

00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,720
to tell me when they're looping felt a

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,739
simple form and I use that based on

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,359
their start date and if they tell me

00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:26,639
they're just using it overnight or

00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,929
they're also using it 24/7 and I

00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:29,609
actually do a little bit of estimate to

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,230
figure out how many days and hours of

00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:32,759
experience do we have right now that

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,259
number is somewhere around nine million

00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,659
hours of experience across all the

00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:37,200
different DIY systems around the world

00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:39,239
conservative number of people

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,340
conservative number of hours but this

00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:42,539
matters because if you look into health

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,980
care and you look at the commercial

00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,929
devices that are being submitted for

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,820
regulatory approval around the world the

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,899
pivotal trial is the big fancy clinical

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,820
trials that are done to say this thing

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,649
is ready to go to market when that gets

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:57,049
submitted to regulatory approval a lot

00:19:52,649 --> 00:20:00,960
of those trials have 150,000 hours

00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:02,429
150,000 hours of study our community has

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,070
chosen to keep using this for something

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:07,710
around 9 million plus hours so let me

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,909
tell you we have learned a lot and this

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,139
is what I'm talking about when I say

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:11,669
open source is changing healthcare

00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:13,409
because this data isn't just going to

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,749
waste I refuse to let it go to waste

00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,190
we've built a data Commons on a tool in

00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,809
a platform called open humans which

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,980
allows you to put your data and share it

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:22,409
with projects and start research

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,999
projects and I refuse to let all this

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:25,919
beautiful data go to waste and I refuse

00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:27,690
to let the companies ignore it so I've

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,879
made this dataset freely available it's

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,960
anonymized by the individuals data being

00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:32,130
donated

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,149
if somebody requests me it doesn't

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,559
matter if you're a company it doesn't

00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,940
matter if you're an individual a data

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,010
science of person with diabetes you can

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,580
request access to this data and learn

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,559
from it

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,809
how are people dosing differently with a

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,440
closed loop system than not what can we

00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:47,279
been able to do such as completely

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,929
eliminating manual interactions

00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,190
something people thought could not be

00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,020
done into the second generation of the

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,669
commercial systems many of us are doing

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,899
that in the open source community so how

00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,789
can we take the best of what we've

00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:58,590
learned and put it into the commercial

00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,360
devices that put it into the academic

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,590
studies that are being done and so we're

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,480
starting to see that done which is

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,980
really fantastic but I want to share at

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,779
least two other anecdotes other than my

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,669
love of sleep to tell you a little bit

00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,340
about why some people are using this

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:12,899
there are two gentlemen who quantified

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,669
their experiences with open EPS that I

00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:16,649
think are pretty significant one of them

00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:18,450
is a gentleman named SIL Kihara he lives

00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:20,940
in Finland and he has a young son with

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,679
diabetes and his son was very very

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,510
little when he was diagnosed and they

00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,279
were tracking everything so every time

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,600
they touched the pump and had to make a

00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,740
manual correction remember I said we

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,539
make lots of decisions throughout the

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,830
day lots of manual Corrections they were

00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,380
having to chase their young two-year-old

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,789
son around and give them about four and

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,110
a half manual interventions a day if

00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:38,070
you've ever had a two-year-old imagine

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,230
making them eat something when they

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,820
don't want to or holding them down long

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,010
enough to get a hold of their pump to

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,990
press buttons for 30 seconds that's hard

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,580
that's a lot of work and that was mom

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,990
that was dad that was grandparents that

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,480
was caregivers at school the school

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,919
nurse whatever that's a lot of work so

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,289
that's what's shown on the left and over

00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,820
time as they started open APS they gave

00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:59,070
it the ability to dose more insulin

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,320
switched insulins added fancy features

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,899
now they have to do less than one manual

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,340
intervention per day again almost five

00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:07,049
things per day versus less than one

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,950
thing per day that's pretty significant

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,779
especially when you're talking about a

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,460
young child and the quality of life

00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,559
because when you have diabetes it's not

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,630
just your disease you're the one who

00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,279
physically have it but if impacts your

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,630
parents it impacts your siblings and

00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,140
impacts your spouse and impacts your

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,059
loved ones

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,039
it really does impact the whole family

00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:25,620
so this to me is really impactful of

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,510
showing the whole family story of why

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,190
people are choosing to do open source

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,320
and DIY it's because our quality of life

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,659
kind of stinks sometimes the type one

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,740
diabetes it is so hard to do and even if

00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:36,419
you get really good outcomes

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,669
sokka is also really great about showing

00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,919
his his glucose levels before and after

00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:43,080
his son went on an open EPS the average

00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,270
glucose is are the same but the amount

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,860
of work they have to do is so

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,840
much less and a peace of mind that they

00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,130
have and probably the quality of life of

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,930
a child growing up with diabetes you

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,150
can't quantify that but I've got to

00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,100
think that's pretty amazing and one

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,400
other example I'll tell you about Jason

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,500
Whitmer son has had diabetes and in

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,570
fourth grade before they started open

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,610
ApS he found out that his son went to

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,640
the school nurse about 420 times in a

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:11,130
school year so before lunch after lunch

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,120
before gym anytime he was low or high

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,610
and had to get help

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,770
treating 400 to 20 times he left the

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,120
classroom away from his peers that's a

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,280
lot of distraction from learning right

00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,760
well contrast that to after his son

00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:27,500
started using open EPS in sixth grade

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,500
five five times

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,409
and Jason is also really great to follow

00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:37,330
on Twitter because he is very real and

00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:39,850
open about how his son uses open a PS

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,139
he's also I think an ICU doc so he's

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,179
talked about the time where he's looked

00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:44,980
down at the the visualization tool he

00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,869
has and realized my son just ate lunch

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,159
and he forgot to put his carbs in and so

00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:50,230
he'll be running down the hall the dad

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,879
will in ICU to go deal with the code

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,830
whatever situation and he'll be entering

00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:57,909
carbs for his son's pancreas across town

00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,470
at school which is pretty cool and the

00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:01,600
other nice thing about Internet of

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,129
Things is making these things internet

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,669
connected means that you can do what you

00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,679
want with it

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,090
so for me having a glanceable display I

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,350
love my pebble because I can just glance

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,999
down and say yeah my blood sugar went up

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,499
from the excitement but my pancreas

00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:12,279
kicked in and it's heading down now and

00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:14,980
it's gonna be fine

00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,600
especially when I calm down but it's

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,009
nice because if you are an Android phone

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,989
user and you love your Android and you

00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:23,200
will never ever ever ever go to an

00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:24,940
iDevice that's fine this thing will

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,399
connect to your android if you are an

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,409
iPhone diehard lover that's fine too I

00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,149
use an iPhone you can see your stuff on

00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:32,980
your iPhone you can get connectivity to

00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:35,919
that if you want to say hey Siri I'm

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,600
about to speak at a higher Target or a

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,970
lower Target or whatever you can text

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,559
your pancreas you really can you can

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,639
press a button on your watch that's my

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,379
favorite way of doing it it's very

00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:48,700
discreet I just press three buttons and

00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:50,019
I can set a higher target I can set a

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,340
lower target I can enter what I'm eating

00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:52,960
and nobody would know what I was doing I

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,340
don't have to pull out my medical device

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,139
and fumble around which is really really

00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,340
common otherwise or choose to step out

00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:59,169
of the room or go into the bathroom or

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,730
do something like that imagine how nice

00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:02,440
the difference is of a job interview

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,419
with type 1 diabetes with and without

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,129
these devices having to decide if you go

00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,210
to an interview lunch what do you do for

00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,679
your insulin dosing whether you're

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,090
injecting or pulling out your pump or

00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:11,259
dealing with that when you don't really

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,609
want to make diabetes the point of the

00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,899
conversation but it kind of becomes the

00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:15,789
point of the conversation even if you

00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:18,460
don't want that to be the focus with

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:19,779
this stuff it doesn't have to be so if

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,489
you want to use Alexa you want to use

00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,690
Google home you want to use this with

00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:23,980
that the thing that hasn't come up with

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,330
yet yes pretty much

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,559
and because it's open source we have

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,940
people come in all the time in the

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,869
community and say oh what about this I'm

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,720
like hey that's a cool idea you should

00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:32,980
go do it like what but like yeah you've

00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,269
got the device I don't have that device

00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,590
like you do it I can coach you I can

00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:37,389
help you I'll help you review the pull

00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,279
requests but like you go do it so some

00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:40,389
of the coolest things have come from

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,619
people in the community doing things

00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:42,669
where they're like hey this is my use

00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:44,440
case I want to make it better for me

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,880
okay great let's do that

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,920
and one of my favorite examples is the

00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,290
hardware that we've used over time so

00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,170
very early on my system looked like this

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,000
so this big honkin Raspberry Pi 2 in a

00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,380
big black case with the big radio stick

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,630
on top it actually had terrible range

00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,740
this radio stick was designed just to

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,940
read ate off the pump

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,710
but what bin West figured out is that

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,120
you could also write to the pump which

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,090
was great except for the range was about

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,250
this big ish to the point where I had

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,690
one under my mattress and dangling over

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,070
the headboard at night and then one on

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,820
the bedside so if I rolled over

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:17,380
I was translated between a signal and I

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,670
would carry this thing around along with

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:22,150
my blackberry and everything else that's

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:23,020
my old hardware stack from late 2014 but

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,760
there was a gentleman named Oscar

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,530
Pearson in the UK and he was like look

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,870
my wife is a midwife she has scrub

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,700
pockets this does not fit we got to do

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,140
something else really great tell us what

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,060
ideas you have like we're not hardware

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,800
people not a traditional whatever

00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,420
whatever like but tell us what you got

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,730
and so he started working with the Intel

00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,800
Edison platform and he figured out a

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,510
radio sniff that worked with that and he

00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,860
rewrote some radio software to allow us

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,900
to use a different platform other than

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,980
the Raspberry Pi and so as a result of

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,360
that we fell in love with the Intel

00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,650
Edison because it's small its power

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,570
efficient it's tiny it doesn't take this

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,950
big hunk in case in battery really

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,600
really great we actually met somebody

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,850
who had a family connection to diabetes

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,200
had a hardware shop he helped us build

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,490
an open-source board that was

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,300
manufactured for the community and

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,920
that's what I'm wearing today

00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,690
that's what's pictured in the top right

00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,880
and that's what I'm wearing

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,230
chapstick for scale and then my European

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,090
friends think it's really really funny

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,490
so they gave me European chapstick and a

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,080
unicorn because I talk about unicorn

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:17,310
sometimes so they're there well the

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,620
reason I'm showing this is because sadly

00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,700
the Intel Edison was discontinued and we

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,110
are very very sad

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,190
so side note if you have Edison's

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,680
sitting around that you're not using

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,060
email me I will find you a buyer put

00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,040
them on eBay please put them to good use

00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,050
but because of that we decided to go

00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,980
back to the PI because over time the PI

00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,540
has gotten different and better

00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,790
everybody here got a Raspberry Pi zero

00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,430
with headers whoo and an SD card if you

00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:40,600
don't want those I'll take them because

00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:43,060
that is half of an artificial pancreas

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,950
so we added what we call the Explorer

00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,450
hat - mimics Explorer board but it

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,500
actually had a screen because there are

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,060
people in the community who said hey we

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,470
go camping we don't wanna have to use

00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,910
our phone as a display we'd love to have

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,490
a screen right on the rig with a great

00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,720
building so they did so now we have the

00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,670
Explorer hat with the screen and buttons

00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,300
so you can see all the information you

00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,550
would see

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,160
some people and so we have the Explorer

00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,380
hat so we can basically play around with

00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,760
whatever hardware Linux machines we want

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,870
to which is really great and again it

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,640
comes down to somebody has an idea they

00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,200
come in and just likes weeks and he said

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,310
oh there's this new radio thing I think

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,390
it would be cheaper than that it doesn't

00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,550
have the screen but some people might

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,800
want that like should we do something a

00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,900
migrate do it right the documentation

00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,950
will put it in no problem so that's how

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,600
the kind of a lot of the coolest

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,860
features of hardware have evolved as

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,090
people coming in saying I want to try

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,830
this and we're like great go forth let's

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,940
try it let's see if it works if we get

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,380
it documented we can share with the

00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,150
community and people start to use it

00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,460
which is really really great so again

00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,930
Internet of Things is awesome but don't

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,130
pin your hopes on one device if you're

00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,350
not the manufacturer because sometimes

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,340
it goes away and you kind of have to

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,600
deal with that but the nice thing is

00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,460
there are so many devices you can use

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,630
you can use the PI zero you can use the

00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,730
PI two the three the whatever you want

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,680
to use you can even use just like a big

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,870
clunky Linux machine on your laptop and

00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,480
plug in a radio stick not very portable

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,680
but for a bedside device it works just

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,480
fine it reads the data right to data

00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,300
it's all good but I want to emphasize

00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,380
something when you talk about diabetes

00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,870
hopefully I've convinced you that it's

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,790
not easy and that the risk of living

00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,430
with diabetes is so big that adding on

00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,080
the additional risk and the issues that

00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,550
come with running a system like this

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,900
outweigh at the quality of life the

00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:13,060
outcomes the benefit from most people

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,380
who choose to run it they decided yes

00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,000
the people who don't choose to run it

00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,290
said like it's not worth it to me or I

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,180
don't like the security issues or

00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,440
whatever but a lot of people think well

00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,690
how can you do this you're not a doctor

00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,070
you're not a coder you're not of this

00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,020
you're not the bad like who do you think

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,290
you are to do this it's like well it's

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,180
not rocket science it's a little bit of

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,100
code that's basically the same algorithm

00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,960
every person with diabetes learns when

00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,330
they're diagnosed if your blood sugar is

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,860
going high give more insulin according

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,320
to your settings if your blood sugar is

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,030
going low give less insulin according to

00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,530
your settings but the beauty of this is

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,760
the computer is designed to do it every

00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,110
five minutes that's probably hard to

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,370
read this is part of what's online but I

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,040
can also link it to directly if you want

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,810
to see this part but this is what face I

00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,590
make in my computer anytime you say but

00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,560
you're not oh whatever

00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,240
because that's ridiculous but the other

00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,890
reason I say this is because a lot of

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,990
people who come from non open-source

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,300
non-technical backgrounds myself

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,710
included it's hard because you're faced

00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,940
with a room full of amazing people with

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,100
all this amazing intellect and you're

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,390
like ooh what do I know but the most

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,070
important thing that I've learned in

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,830
open-source is the willingness

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,480
to try absolutely the most important

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,490
skill is just the willingness to show up

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,990
and to try and to ask questions I have

00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,920
been blown away by the generosity and

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,750
the kindness and the open source

00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,280
community technical people outside of

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,870
healthcare the healthcare open-source

00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,840
community it's been absolutely amazing

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,070
and this is what I tell to the rest of

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,180
the world especially healthcare who's

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,200
really hung up on what you're not a

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,270
doctor you're not this you're none of

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,500
that I say no we're not engineers and

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,510
we're not doctors and we're not whatever

00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,550
as our professional jobs but we are

00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,380
engineering solutions we are doing

00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,510
science experiments every single day as

00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,190
a person with diabetes we have to

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,780
research we have to invent because

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,760
what's coming out is not coming out fast

00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,290
enough and it's not good enough and

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,870
that's why we're doing what we're doing

00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:54,310
and the approach you've probably seen a

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,040
visual like this that talks about

00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,840
traditional innovation processes but the

00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,220
way I describe it is that traditional

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,420
healthcare companies and people working

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,460
to bring health care products to market

00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,800
they don't think that there's any value

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,180
in bringing out a wheel they can't sell

00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,040
a wheel really like their goal is the

00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,510
self-driving car right five years

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,840
self-driving car it'll be out just wait

00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,640
it'll be fine right well the reality is

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,130
it's not so much about the self-driving

00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,660
car the root problem here is we want to

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,520
go from point A to point B and

00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,630
preferably with not as much work because

00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,030
it's really really hard especially with

00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,170
type 1 diabetes and we in the community

00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,220
are really good with saying like look we

00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,110
don't know how to build a self-driving

00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,210
car or a car or anything

00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,710
we're not car manufacturers we don't

00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,210
know we're doing but we do know really

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,680
diabetes and we understand the problem

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,450
which in a root of the problem is how do

00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,430
we go from point A to point B and hey

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,500
look there's a block of wood and some

00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,750
wheels let's make a skateboard it's

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,670
better than nothing so my first rig is

00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,290
was a skateboard it was big it was

00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,600
clunky it was ugly people loved to laugh

00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,910
at it but it worked close the loop I got

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,410
to sleep for 12 hours and not worry and

00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,910
over time people came along and said boo

00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,470
what if we changed the hardware or what

00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,210
if we add a handle bar then you can

00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,380
steer you have a scooter and I should

00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,930
probably change this to be a scooters

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,640
cuz I love East scooters now but over

00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,170
along the way you can evolve all the way

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,250
to the point we have a car and in the

00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,350
case in the open source diabetes

00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,570
community we had the self-driving car

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,280
four years ago three years ahead of

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,350
commercial manufacturers and we didn't

00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,910
stop there we have continued evolving

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,290
and taking away a lot of the manual

00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,820
things that you have to do as a person

00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,100
with diabetes even with this technology

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,820
and so the quality of life is really

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,830
incredible

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,040
but I don't want you to think that this

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,620
just applies to diabetes

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,960
there is so much good that people with

00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,370
open source can do if you start looking

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,140
around you and talking to the loved ones

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:38,040
in your life you probably know somebody

00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,330
with cancer asthma cystic fibrosis some

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,760
rare disease that most people haven't

00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,140
heard of you name it and if you ask them

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,760
ask them like what is your biggest

00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,800
problem what is the thing that most

00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,660
annoys you and like once you get past

00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,770
like wide like a cure and kind of those

00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,750
big picture things that you can't really

00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,270
tackle start asking the questions about

00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:56,580
what could you tackle for me it was a

00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:58,080
make a louder alarm just make a louder

00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,030
alarm I can't fix all the problem with

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,190
my devices but if we can free the data I

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,720
can do something useful for it and you

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,550
can start chipping away and making

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,100
solutions and you end up with something

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,960
so much bigger and so much better than

00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,460
you would have ever thought possible and

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,140
that's in the case of what we did with

00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,880
diabetes but we're just at the tip of

00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,860
the iceberg of what can be done in

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,110
healthcare and open source so I

00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,910
challenge you to think about what could

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,980
be done if you took your open source

00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,140
skills and started talking with people

00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,180
your colleagues your friends your loved

00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,370
ones and said what could we do how can

00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,290
we take what you do and apply it to this

00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,300
it doesn't have to be a lot of time the

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:35,490
open ApS project we did this all our

00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,720
spare time nights and weekends of coding

00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,010
and working together of talking to

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,470
people on the internet around the world

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,940
in different time zones nobody has been

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,400
funded in the open EPS project to work

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,110
on that work so it's not about the money

00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,760
I think we're a yesterday said it's

00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,410
about the impact and I think that's

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,210
absolutely true in health care there is

00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,800
nothing more rewarding than seeing an

00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,900
open source project that you worked on

00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,850
really changed somebody's life any time

00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,290
I hear a story of somebody whether it's

00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,870
Jason's son going to the school nurse

00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:02,820
less silca and his son saying I don't

00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,900
remember what it's like without open ApS

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,460
and thinking that's a good thing because

00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,160
his life is really good with diabetes

00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,150
that's absolutely amazing and I would

00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,380
love for you all to have that

00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,300
opportunity and I would love for you all

00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,710
to lend your skills because again

00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,650
there's only so much time in a day I

00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,000
only have two hands my focus area is

00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,440
diabetes but I'm really passionate about

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,730
helping connect other people so if

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,050
you're like look I really want to help

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,450
but I don't know anybody out there with

00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,250
a problem let me know I can help find

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,510
you at somebody in a patient community

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,190
who's been looking for a technical

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,360
person to partner with because really

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,010
one of the most beautiful things about

00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,970
open APS is the partnerships and the

00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,950
collaborations of the open source

00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,260
community I didn't do this by myself

00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,700
this is it has always been a community

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,480
project people working together sharing

00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,220
their skill

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,290
sharing their ideas saying what could we

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,820
do next what can we do together that to

00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,250
me is really the boat the beauty of open

00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,350
source so I will just close by saying

00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,840
there's actually two other kinds of

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,460
people the room those who are willing to

00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,109
do open source and healthcare and those

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,030
who'll not and I'm hoping that after

00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:58,650
today more of y'all will be in the group

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,210
who will be considering how can we take

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,070
our open source stuff or tech stuff or

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,720
linux stuff what can we do in healthcare

00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,510
today because we're not going to dweet

00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,550
to change and I want you to help so

00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:12,030
thank you
