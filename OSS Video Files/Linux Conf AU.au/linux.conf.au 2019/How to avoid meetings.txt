Have a call instead of sending email, they said. It's better for communication, they said.

What if everyone hates meetings, and the rooms are perpetually booked, and nobody understands your accent? How do you do that day in, day out with an international team across time zones and languages? How do you keep everyone engaged, make sure work doesn’t get siloed between sites, ensure everyone feels empowered to ask questions? What if one group doesn’t quite speak the common language, or isn’t up to speed on how to push back on work?  How about resolving conflict, or translating professional contexts?

This talk is the coalescing of years of experience working with many international teams in multiple countries. It will cover: successful and unsuccessful strategies for pulling together software teams across time and space; embracing the awkward; spotting conflicts before they escalate; translating context and taxonomy; and how to grow participation and collaboration. Most importantly, it will go through how to stealthily work yourself out of a job by teaching everyone else to do it.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,610
hi everyone

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,170
yep my name is Maya and I am gonna tell

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,849
you how to avoid meetings actually

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,620
that's a total lie I'm gonna tell you to

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,360
have a whole heap of meetings without

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,480
having meetings that's what I'm actually

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,670
going to tell you so here is a thing

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,039
from a Gartner report from about 10 12

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,560
years ago about globalized workforces

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,430
who here has worked with either a

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,020
distributed or an international team yep

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:38,190
yeah yeah me too

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,690
hello welcome capitalism it's kind of

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,250
changing the way it's being done all

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,890
over the world and that it stopped being

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,170
just outsourcing and started being more

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,649
collaborative and a lot of the work I do

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,050
is working with collaborative teams

00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:53,789
solving software problems and I've lived

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,890
and worked in a bunch of countries and

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,440
worked with even more people in all

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,300
kinds of places and I thought I'd just

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,649
give a bit of a summary of some of the

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,610
stuff I've learned and some of the

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,500
techniques I use for me working with

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,330
international software teams often looks

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,880
like very early alarms and a lot of

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,380
meeting on aeroplanes I do not recommend

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,290
those alarms it also often involves a

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,259
whole heap of people using here as the

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,189
default pronoun because turns out that's

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,479
a thing that happens a lot it's happened

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,829
a lot to me when I was living in India

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,689
for a year and a half working with a

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,180
software team and I was like what's

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,150
going on is it like the is the Hindi or

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,540
the Kannada the tunel word for you know

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,590
third person pronoun always he and

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,780
everyone would know what are you talking

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,909
about turned out it wasn't in India

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:50,220
thing it was a colonialism thing hi

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:53,340
colonialism yeah when the British is as

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,240
they are called they're left in 1947

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,719
they left 1947 English behind so all the

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,969
textbooks only have male pronouns nobody

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,850
ever uses women in any kind of pronoun

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,619
unless it's for cooking or having

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,440
children or sometimes in anatomy

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,180
textbooks so that took a while to change

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,210
and you know could have blew people's

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,460
minds when I you know even when most of

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,760
the software development team was women

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:26,290
just didn't occur to anyone to do it it

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,730
turned out what you can change that also

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,220
kinds of things that happen is that

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,680
people do really cool quirky things with

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,750
language I don't know how many of you

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,270
like have learnt another language or

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:43,210
speak another language yeah a few people

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:46,120
yeah yeah is it really hard yeah yeah

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,830
it's true he heard and also really cool

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,110
things happen which are sort of like

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,540
what had happen if Google Translate had

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,620
a bit of a mind so people will say

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,210
things like yeah if we're going to do

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,270
subtraction addition were also going to

00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,710
do updation to these fields which

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,370
doesn't exist in English but makes

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,020
perfect sense and I had all these hard

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,550
all these impulses to punch people

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,310
because they were doing such cool things

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:12,610
of language except I had to instead sit

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,140
down and tell them if you continue doing

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,200
this in a professional context people

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,200
aren't going to take you seriously which

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,390
broke my heart a little bit but I had to

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,190
tell them because one day they're not

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,959
going to be able to get the right kind

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,670
of job because they aren't using the

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,650
right kind of language and they were

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,910
doing the same thing to me they they'd

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,160
sit me down go you know the way you

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:38,740
phrase that that's really rude here all

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,290
our Tech's on amis are wrong turns out

00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,290
everyone's usually wrong for someone

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,680
who's already aware of this who's who's

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,470
encountered this before yeah yeah yeah

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,420
yeah who's actually changed like not

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:57,670
just languages but say work fields yeah

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,550
few people have you noticed her taxonomy

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,709
changes a lot when you do that yep and

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,340
people use the same word to mean totally

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,760
different things

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,660
yeah it's great doesn't cause any

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,640
problems for anyone ever another thing

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,170
that happens when people move around a

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,180
lot is that will you know will make

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,700
mental shortcuts people like this I like

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,680
that people who are from here behave in

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,690
those kinds of ways or have these kinds

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,850
of beliefs to a point they're true

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,610
stereotypes are not necessarily

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,330
true it's just that they're in

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,540
oversimplifications they're not untrue

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,730
they are incomplete and all human minds

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,980
tend toward the what I like to call

00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,510
single narrative syndrome there is the

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,230
one true story that explains all the

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:43,000
facts and the more you deal with life

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,180
you know the more we all learn that

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,550
actually it's more complicated than that

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,040
always forever on everything and this is

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,560
another one of those things where it

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,560
wasn't always true that the way people

00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,070
behaved were because of the stereotype

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,840
for example the China part of the team

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,490
isn't raising problems early enough

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,050
they're just saying yes and then we find

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,630
out months later that actually they

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,950
couldn't do the thing we wanted

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,930
maybe it's because that's a China

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,760
culture maybe it's because the previous

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,250
delivery lead who was based in the US

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,910
cause them problems that's not

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,050
necessarily because of the stereotype

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,140
sometimes it's because people come from

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,530
different kinds of cultures so some

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:30,640
cultures say it's okay to ask anything

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,400
and it's okay to say no and in some

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,960
cultures that's not okay you never asked

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,530
for something unless you know what the

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,710
answer is

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,320
or you ask it in a sort of a quiet

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,510
feeling though what does that weigh G to

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,760
be really convenient if I you know I'm

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,380
gonna be really late if I don't like

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,620
take a cab this afternoon but I know

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,990
you're driving that way also would you

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,960
like some tea and just wait for someone

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,100
else to offer and that's a really normal

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,650
way in another culture to do things

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,930
yes culture looks like

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:08,650
passive-aggressive irritating behavior

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,670
when you're used to ask culture yep and

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,920
the other way around

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,110
what are you doing asking me I have to

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,700
say yes now that means I just have to

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,630
avoid you forever in case you ask me for

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:23,980
things I don't want to say yes to what

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:26,170
also happened these micro cultures the

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,850
school you went to at a certain year and

00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,710
the kinds of signs that hung up on the

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,510
walls that said how to use your nice

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,180
voice completely change people's

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,190
expectations of how it's normal to ask

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,980
things how it's normal to behave what

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:42,700
sort of words it's okay to expect you

00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:45,220
and expect others to use which means

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,110
that even people who've come from the

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,640
same kind of place sometimes have

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,560
difficulty in understanding what the

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,900
words mean and that's before we've

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,590
changed fields or languages or countries

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,660
or anything like that that creates

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,640
problems when I'm doing when we're

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,950
making private jokes and what

00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,780
constitutes a private joke changes all

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,870
the time like if you make a joke about

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,760
the grand final and half of your team is

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,150
in another country and doesn't play AFL

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,950
or if you're making a joke about one of

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,360
the many many Prime Minister's your

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,540
country has had in the past several

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,700
years yeah yeah most of us know what

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,470
that means here not everyone does and

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,240
when you make that kind of joke without

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,670
explaining the context where not

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,290
everyone knows the context we're leaving

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,150
someone else so someone feels left out

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,360
of the little group of the little micro

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,070
culture and the opposite that of that is

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,990
creating like a little tribe like

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,260
creating a micro culture for us you know

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,610
we all now have a private joke and

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,200
everybody knows each other and everyone

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,790
feels a little bit closer in it's a it's

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:54,370
a really good way to create a feeling of

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:56,290
a team another thing to consider is

00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:00,070
who's governance model wins but and

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,440
that's everything from do we have goat

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,030
tracks or do we have roads that go for

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,180
scooters or are we building an airport

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,100
and what time you stand up what language

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,700
are we using when we communicate who's

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,640
using you know can we use zoom yeah what

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,110
can we use whatever mediocre video

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,360
conferencing technology we're using

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,310
they're all mediocre let's face it

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,690
whichever one we're using is it

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,940
accessible to everyone

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,470
are we actually building in time for

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,970
people to have connection problems at

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:33,130
the start of the meeting I take my own

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,360
photos for all of my slides which is

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,880
probably why they're not quite as shiny

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,510
as other peoples but also why they

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,460
contain a lot of pictures of goats if

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,860
you want to talk about goats find me

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:50,940
later the governance models you create

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,900
create barriers of entry for someone and

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,820
sometimes you're the goat and

00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:03,760
the other motorcycle hello yeah Oh tough

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:05,800
crowd but the barriers that you create

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,540
sometimes just part of what you need to

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,290
do one of the projects I worked on was

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,240
creating an app for an Ebola clinic

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,420
during the height of the Ebola epidemic

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,960
you know 2015 West Africa we had three

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,360
months to do it

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,640
Ebola is a really difficult disease to

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,410
treat because you have a quarantined

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,570
area for everyone and for anyone to go

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,310
in there they have to basically crawl

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:35,700
into a space suit and wear three gloves

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:37,990
and very like extremely tight

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,240
requirements on what you can physically

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,550
wear and of course it's West Africa it's

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,900
hot it's humid you can maybe spend forty

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,000
five minutes running you know doing

00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,150
rounds treating people you have to do

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,950
recording of what you're doing so that

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,180
the next people are going to know what

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,210
you're doing

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,600
so in that case whatever the doctors

00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,250
wanted one they wanted this word instead

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,500
of that word they wanted this instead of

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,330
that they wanted clear clear UX that's

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,010
what they got and that was reasonable

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,660
you know that they won because their

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,740
problems were a lot more important than

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,300
the software team's not always true we

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,740
also need to think about you know what

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,660
do we each need to practice in order to

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,340
be able to make the experience easier

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,300
for other people if you've worked in if

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,480
you've ever had a long-distance

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,970
relationship of any sort personal or

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,610
professional you might have figured out

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,650
that it's you know it's possible to

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,360
maintain a relationship long distance at

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,330
the same level but it's very hard to

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,600
change it over the phone and it's very

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,600
hard to solve relationship problems with

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,460
a more distance everyone will tell you

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,530
have more meetings keep the

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,450
videoconference open visit each other

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,180
when you can that's a good thing to do

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:57,400
if you can not all projects can afford

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:59,470
it all relationships that have discussed

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,630
what sort of a relationship they are

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,240
tend to survive problems better than

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,860
relationships that don't and that's true

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,270
for personal and professional ones by

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,740
the time

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:11,250
you're solving a problem within the

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,710
relationship if you haven't solved how

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,780
we communicate and how we resolve

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,640
problems and what our internal processes

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,190
are you're having to figure those out on

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,650
the fly already while you're in conflict

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,880
that's gonna hurt this is what we have

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,510
codes of conduct before we start

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,800
conferences for example one of the

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,150
conversations I like to have with people

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,040
early on is how do you want to have

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,200
arguments and the first time somebody

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,420
asked me that I I was shocked I'd no

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,540
idea how to answer these days I have an

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,550
answer but you know do you want to shout

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,110
at me do you want a phone call do you

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,850
want time to think about it you're on a

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,670
slack maid you want private time what do

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,680
you want what works for you that's a

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,050
part of sort of the code of conduct part

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,670
of the ways of communicating that each

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,160
relationship needs to have and sometimes

00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,040
it grows naturally but if you don't know

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,450
what it is and you haven't agreed on

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,640
what it is and how you want to change it

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,290
if there's a conflict you're gonna have

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,930
to resolve that while you're in conflict

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:10,830
as well that's gonna suck like don't do

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:13,200
it if you can model good behavior model

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,750
good behavior the standard you walk past

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,300
is the standard you accept and that's

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,360
true for communication and that's true

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:26,370
for ways of resolving conflict that's

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,080
true for all kinds of things and if

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,300
you're not normalizing conflict

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,760
resolution you're normalizing unresolved

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,820
conflict again the standard you walk

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,810
past is a standard you accept and what

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,490
I've learnt is that there's no such

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,200
thing as a small thing especially when

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,210
someone's remote like if I'm saving it

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,150
for retro at the end of the month or if

00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,370
I'm saving it for a private conversation

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,740
in two weeks time we're not going to get

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,800
to the little thing of hey the way you

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,540
use that word can make some people feel

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,250
left out that's a that's a really good

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,480
conversation to have early to have

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:04,680
quickly it's awkward it's okay be

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,300
awkward micro adult in the same way that

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,880
you're creating micro cultures create

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,980
micro adulting experiences for yourself

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,540
and the more you do that you the more

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,000
you make it normal for other people to

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,310
do that

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,740
have the awkward conversation early do

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,430
it as often and early as you can put out

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:26,610
the fires

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:27,420
before they're big fires yes the thing I

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,339
learned is that

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,990
adulting is for people who don't a crime

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,720
or later you're either cry a little bit

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:37,050
now or more later adulting is paying off

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,240
your tech debt early is what it is

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,770
because there's always interest on

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,630
whatever debt you've got whether it's

00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,240
technical or social and you might not

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,070
know what it is yet but you will sooner

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,480
or later and sometimes it's just that

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,770
you don't know how to resolve conflicts

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:56,370
when they do happen and when you need to

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:58,589
do it yeah if you don't have a lot of

00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,910
big crap meetings where nothing gets

00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,410
resolved you're gonna have to resolve

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,670
everything before you get into the

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:07,020
meeting I'm sorry

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,240
dealing with people requires dealing

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,040
with people and I know that's not always

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,470
everyone's favorite way to do things but

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,970
it is the thing find ways to talk to

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,360
people individually have all the pre

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,160
meeting meetings one of my favorite ways

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,080
to do pre meeting meetings is once a

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,910
week I will make sure that I've

00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,080
contacted everyone on my team and I

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:30,360
don't care if they're the GM of my area

00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,250
or if there's somebody I barely talked

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,900
to or if they're the person I sit next

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,560
to every day what have we done this week

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,839
that you're proud of

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,850
there's always something and if you can

00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,270
tell me and there you can always tell me

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,550
something you get a sticker

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:47,160
it's non-food reward and it's awesome

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,320
and it gives me an excuse to talk to

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,170
people and it gives me a sense of how

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,720
they calibrate achievement both in

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,010
themselves and in other people and it

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,620
means that we all get to know each other

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:03,930
a bit also the only people who've ever

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:06,810
asked me back are people who do Q a fun

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,490
fact the thing to remember is that when

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,870
we're changing relationships we're all

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,390
hacking each other like it's all culture

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,620
hacking people are hacking my culture

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,230
I'm hacking their culture we're all

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,930
changing our relationship we're creating

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:22,410
conflict conflict is not necessarily bad

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,870
but conflict needs resolution so

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,610
conflict resolution 101 you take the

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,680
word year out of conversation it's all I

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,560
statements when this happened I felt

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,880
like this it's not you should do this

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,390
it's how might we

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,850
how can we resolve this those kinds of

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,160
statements are true for people who know

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,400
and have grown up in a culture where

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,290
those kinds of statements and that kind

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,940
of language means something where they

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,950
can interpret what people are trying to

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,110
say somebody grows up in a different

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,540
culture and doesn't know what those

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,280
phrases mean don't understand the word

00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:01,350
I'm trying to do is resolve conflict and

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:04,440
try and make people feel unintel you did

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:09,870
this thing and it was a problem because

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:12,150
and I expect you to do XYZ later because

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:16,140
that way I'm taking out the burden of

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:18,510
other people second-guessing my cultural

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,340
doublespeak because it's doublespeak you

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,350
know people have to interpret things and

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,370
we all know how to interpret some stuff

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,490
but not necessarily everyone's stuff and

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,490
I had to learn the hard way when to when

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:35,070
to use the kinds of statements that in

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,020
other situations are just incendiary

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,090
inflammatory and make problems and

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,990
escalate situations in some situations

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:47,340
they deescalate things the hard part is

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:48,870
knowing when to use which yeah the

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,270
unconscious base we've all heard of

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,310
unconscious bias yep yeah we all have an

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,410
unconscious bias to for example like

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,560
people like us or to trust the opinion

00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,320
of people who we identify with in some

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,760
way one of the ways to do that is if you

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,140
have a good relationship with somebody

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,680
it is possible to help deescalate

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,680
conflicts that they're having with

00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,870
someone else I use the unconscious bias

00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:19,699
to drag my male friends to talks about

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:22,170
feminism you use it in your own own way

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:26,310
another thing that I do to create

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,990
cultures is that I create cultures and I

00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,040
you know I enforce things and I enforce

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,890
things early in our model good behavior

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,620
and then I step away I sometimes have

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,030
opportunities planned or otherwise to

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,080
for example disappear for a few weeks

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:42,390
and one of the things that can happen is

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,510
that while I'm away people start filling

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:49,300
in the role of how to set micro

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,460
cultures and how to connect the team

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,230
properly without me and if I've done my

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,660
job right and I've made sure that other

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,220
people know how to do that it all

00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,930
happens organically and I come back and

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,970
everything's great and someone else is

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,650
suddenly the BA the project manager for

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,900
this bit and someone else has taken over

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,610
sticker time and someone else takes of a

00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:12,670
sticker time I am with the happiest like

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:14,020
that's when I know things are great the

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,710
main thing I've learned is that you

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:19,810
can't create strategy without creating

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,250
strategy for changing culture if things

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,360
are going to be changing if you need

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,890
things to change you need to be able to

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,360
create a plan for how to change the

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,300
culture around things and it doesn't

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,740
matter what else you do if if you're

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,330
trying to change people's minds you're

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,890
gonna have to work within their culture

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:40,210
and they're gonna have to work within

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:42,280
yours and not everyone knows that but I

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:47,530
know that so I can do something about it

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,970
ooh wrong slide this way okay here are

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,250
more places where you can look up

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,500
resources there are a gajillion places

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:58,690
to look up resources go do a

00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:01,390
communication course play around with it

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,990
go do some Anthropology stuff do what

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,990
you need to do

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,070
thank you very much that was brilliant I

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,080
think we unfortunately don't have any

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,909
time for questions please when I have

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,950
five minutes to the next speaker and

00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:27,549
it's tightly jam-packed but please think

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,549
