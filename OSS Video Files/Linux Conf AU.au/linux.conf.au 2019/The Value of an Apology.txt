https://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/239/

An exploration of the effects on the open source community of Linus Torvald's 2018 apology about his behaviour within the Linux kernel community. Examining his apology and the reaction to it in detail, with a look at the Code of Conduct changes that resulted and why all of this matters even if you're not a kernel dev.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

[Applause]

00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,069
thank you

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:11,940
oh hi everybody and my name is Jen I'm a

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,950
front-end developer at catalyst IT so

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,789
just a few disclaimers before we get

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:21,420
started who am I to be talking about

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:24,570
this subject I'm not a genius I'm not a

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,029
10x engineer I'm just another developer

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,490
looking on and I'm giving this talk in

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,380
the developer track because it concerns

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,969
our whole community not just the

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,750
specifics that I'm going to be talking

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,940
about today also this is the first time

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,530
I've ever given a culture talk at a

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,930
conference I normally go for more

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,820
technical talks of course they're safer

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,829
so fingers crossed I don't get myself

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,180
into any trouble today we'll see how we

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,829
go so just a brief content warning

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,899
before we get started it's nothing too

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,030
severe but I do want to say that we are

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,070
going to be talking about some

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,199
aggressive language in the talk this

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,359
morning and I definitely avoided the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,949
worst stuff but we are going to be

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,340
looking at the opinions of some people

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:12,750
who are ideologically opposed to codes

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,930
of conduct and some of those people are

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,210
not so polite let's put it that way

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,240
I have censored any swear words don't

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,979
worry and if you do want to leave

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,780
because you think that might make you

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:37,799
uncomfortable I'm certainly not going to

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:50,899
hold it against you right so let's talk

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:54,420
about slides how do they work so okay

00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:58,880
technology how does it even let's talk

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,880
about Linus Torvalds creator of get

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,979
famous open sorcerer kind of the reason

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,119
we're all here in this room today right

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:13,330
and also Linux is benevolent dictator

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:18,080
for life although perhaps

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:21,590
maybe actually not so benevolent it's an

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,750
open secret in the Linux community that

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,980
Linus has an abrasive manner when

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:30,770
dealing with code review moments I mean

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,230
surely that's not a big deal it was

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,230
pretty bad though swearing at people

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,820
insulting their competency even wishing

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,060
that they were never born and that's the

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,340
polite way of stating it I'm not going

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,400
to give you examples there are plenty

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,370
out there in the wild what's important

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,130
here is that over the years some good

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,230
contributors have tried to push back

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,330
against this behavior and they got

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,240
hounded out of contributing to Linux

00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:02,930
kernel development at all and this went

00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,240
on for years years and years but

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:08,600
seemingly out of the blue in September

00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:12,740
last year linus wrote this in his normal

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,650
release notes message my flippant

00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,200
attacks in emails have been both

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,520
unprofessional and uncalled for

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,880
especially at times when I made it

00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,260
personal I know this was not okay and I

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,750
am truly sorry I need to change some of

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,430
my behavior and I want to apologize to

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,920
the people that my personal behavior

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,930
hurt and possibly drove away from the

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:42,590
kernel development entirely now this is

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:44,300
a good apology for several reasons it's

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,250
not a faux apology

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,260
it doesn't indulge in any of that I'm

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:54,020
sorry that you feel that way

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:56,540
nonsense it admits fault it acknowledges

00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,850
that just an apology isn't enough and

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,840
that he will attempt to fix his behavior

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:08,780
and most importantly it was accompanied

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:12,530
by a concrete change at the same time as

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,690
his apology this happens we got rid of

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,090
the old wishy-washy

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,580
code of conflict that implored

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,490
contributors to in the words of bill &

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,310
ted's be excellent to each other and not

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,770
much else

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,020
that

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,720
old code of conflict was in place for

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,810
three years but it doesn't look like it

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,330
had really any effect there's still some

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,160
quite vitriolic discussion and no

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,630
developers were disciplined for abusive

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,919
comments instead we end up with this the

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:48,300
contributor covenant code of conduct so

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,849
for those of you that don't know what

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,400
what is that well it's a Creative

00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:55,590
Commons license document that can be

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,470
used by open source projects to pledge

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,630
an intent to welcome and value all

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:06,300
contributors and to treat them with

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:07,919
respect code of conduct is not about an

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,470
advance of progressive or left-wing

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,930
politics it's about establishing a

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,759
minimal level of civil and professional

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,349
collaboration this is from their faq

00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,569
civil non-discriminatory and

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,840
professional behavior should be a

00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:27,810
baseline and a shared value held by

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,110
people of all ideologies regardless of

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,820
political affiliation now I can hear

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,750
some of you in your heads right now

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,810
thinking to yourselves well surely

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,930
that's obvious surely we don't need a

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:48,750
document to tell us this do you have to

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:52,020
say sadly don't read the comments and I

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:58,979
did read the comments on this change so

00:05:52,020 --> 00:06:01,409
you don't have to and here's a small

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:03,360
sample of a couple of comments from that

00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:08,039
thread a very long thread with a lot of

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,169
comments on it by the way please don't

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,300
let this near mark cystic compelled

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,810
speech gender feminism equality of

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,150
outcome get even near the Linux kernel

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,880
once they get a foot in the door Linux

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:25,680
will be done punch interface driven

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,150
development works real common and at the

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,289
other end of the spectrum we have the

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,550
people who I just know they're deep out

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,039
in the weeds somewhere I don't know

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,409
while they're thinking from my point of

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,950
view if the code of conduct remains it

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,890
means that the Linux kernel

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:45,210
been compromised and could start spying

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:48,100
on me in the future

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:51,730
so much as many of you doing right now

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:55,900
this was pretty much my reaction I mean

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,210
what even there are a few more

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,340
structured responses but I'm really not

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,440
exaggerating when I say this is a pretty

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,320
representative sample of some of the

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,570
wingnut arees it's really not surprising

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,940
that Linus wants to distance himself

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,010
from these kinds of stances and in fact

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,900
in an interview with the BBC he said the

00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,860
following about the same time as this

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,050
apology I absolutely do not want to be

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,120
seen as being in the same camp as the

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,310
lowlife scum on the internet that think

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,190
it's okay to be a white nationalist Nazi

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:31,260
and have some truly nasty misogynistic

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:33,940
homophobic or transphobic behavior I

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,310
don't know about you all but I read that

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,370
and I got some warm fuzzy feelings this

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,110
is genuinely awesome it was so good here

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,720
somebody who is a leader in the tech

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:55,720
community saying this publicly in 2018

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:59,530
so this is really good however why

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:03,640
Linus's apology is actually maybe not

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:06,010
such a good apology after all so we've

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,830
already seen that it brought all of the

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:12,070
trolls out of the woodwork let's forget

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:16,570
about them and focus purely on his

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,980
actions now I know for a fact that some

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,380
of you will have heard the initial news

00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,140
splash about his apology and then not

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,210
heard much of what came afterwards but

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,380
it turns out that the timing of his

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,940
apology was unfortunately rather cynical

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,000
it was published a handful of days

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,590
before a big New Yorker expose and and

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,510
for those of you not familiar The New

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:41,530
Yorker is a very reputable publication

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:44,280
that does good journalism and this was

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,230
their headline oops sorry

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,070
after years of abusive emails the

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,430
creator of Linux steps aside and in that

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,019
article they said the following

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:59,199
Torvalds decision to step aside came

00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:01,509
after the New Yorker asked him about his

00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:06,540
abusive behavior discouraging women from

00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:10,990
working as Linux kernel programmers now

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:14,230
this does make the whole apology seem a

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:18,209
bit more pro forma for PR reasons right

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,209
rather than a genuine statement I

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:25,480
personally don't think it totally

00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:27,550
negates the value of what he said most

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,819
of what was in the expose was already

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,620
quite an open secret so it's possible he

00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:36,910
could have just doubled down and kept on

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:39,550
doing what he was doing and I really

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,589
hope that other open source project

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,439
contributors will no longer be able to

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:49,420
point to him and say he behaves like

00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:51,430
this so why shouldn't I and I hope that

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,259
the kernel community will enforce their

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,660
new code of conduct and this will

00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:59,019
relatives alt in less bullying and

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,069
greater participation it's been a while

00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:04,410
since September

00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:06,759
what have the effects been so far and

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,410
has the introduction of the code of

00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,949
conducts made any difference

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,809
so Jonathan Corbett one of the folks who

00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:17,769
signed off on the code of conduct change

00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:21,029
commented back in September the written

00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:24,009
code was changed with a single patch

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:28,089
implementing that code maybe a rather

00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:29,680
longer and harder process and he had

00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,170
quite a really good article actually

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,370
where he talked about the fact that

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,079
maybe this wasn't the code of conduct

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,959
but he would have gone with necessarily

00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:39,550
but he felt the time was right and this

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:43,089
was a good step in the right direction

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,459
now as we've already seen there was a

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,379
lot of immediate pushback and many who

00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,870
were V mentally opposed to the changes

00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:53,139
even went so far as raising the specter

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:57,759
of these open-source developers were

00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:59,740
sending their their licenses having said

00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,660
that though and that was a headline at

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,339
the time you might read about it does

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,020
appear that this threat doesn't really

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,390
have any bearing on reality

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,339
there's some technical detail that means

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,080
that although yes sure there are some

00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:13,640
situations where you can revoke your

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,560
license it has to be for a particular

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,850
reason not just because you feel like it

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,709
and that's good news for us as

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,839
open-source developers because that

00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,880
could crumble the foundations of what

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,440
we've been building for the last decades

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:34,550
and actually the person that was really

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,500
pushing this this idea of rescinding

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,320
contributions turns out to be

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,089
specifically a known troll on the kernel

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,060
mailing list who's appeared on their

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:46,490
kill file multiple times so they

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:51,140
definitely had an axe to grind an agenda

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:55,459
to sell now outside of this this hatred

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,779
this vitriol it found a focus and you

00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:00,100
might think that that focus would have

00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:03,140
been Linus I mean he's the bad guy that

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,000
who made this change happen who stepped

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,480
down and put up the code of conduct and

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,970
said okay we're doing this this should

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,829
have been a great step forwards for the

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,589
contributors covenant itself and

00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:17,240
although in some ways it was sadly

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:20,089
that's at a personal cost for its

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,399
originator coralline aider emka she

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:25,130
received death threats over this and

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:29,089
during a high-profile defacement of

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,740
Linux org she was doxed for those of you

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,600
that aren't familiar that means that she

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,910
had her address and personal details

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:40,880
published specifically for reasons of

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:44,600
harassment so that's kind of awful to be

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,300
honest and I hate that this is a thing

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,160
that happened in the world and meanwhile

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:54,560
back in the kernel project with version

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,600
44 point 19 of the kernel the Code of

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,020
Conduct is officially in the kernel code

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,130
base along with one extra documents this

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:08,180
code of conduct interpretation now this

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:10,190
seems to be a document to sort of try

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,290
and placate some of the naysayers to be

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:16,279
honest so it looks like the team have

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,110
gone through the more sane feedback they

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,040
got about pushing back on the code of

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,120
conduct and so

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,300
of trying to just say hey come on guys

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,000
that's not the reality this is how we're

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,959
going to do this thing and you know

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,509
there is going to be due process this

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,209
document has a quote that I found

00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:40,250
particularly telling it says first and

00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:44,810
foremost it is a reasonable expectation

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,709
to have maintain as lead by example so

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,910
that's great

00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:50,959
they acknowledging that Linus was an

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,550
instigator of some of this bad behavior

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,690
and they're saying that they're going to

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:59,060
hold him to a higher standard in future

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:01,579
now less pleasingly unfortunately the

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,560
link to the list of people that actually

00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:07,819
deal with the process code of conduct

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:11,720
reports is broken right now so that's a

00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:13,519
little bit sad I should probably write

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,850
them an email after this talk and say

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,120
hey please fix this up so what is a

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,560
newcomers experience to the projects

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,949
well the code of conduct may have made a

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,709
splash in the existing community and in

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:30,889
the peanut gallery it's still probably

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:33,050
not yet having much impact on potential

00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:36,470
newcomers it's listed in the docs

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:39,230
intended for new kernel developers but

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:42,050
the mailing list which is the main

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:46,490
source of some of this discussion that's

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,199
problematic their FAQ currently has zero

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,800
results if you search for code of

00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:54,380
conduct and in fact they have a Q and a

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,329
bit in there that says that their list

00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,310
is not moderated which is still

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,290
technically true you can have a code of

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,199
conduct and have a none moderated list

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,670
still it just means that if things get

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,949
out of hand you'd you have a point of

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:11,750
escalation so anybody who was new to the

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:13,370
mailing list is not going to be advised

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,829
that their behavior is going to be held

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,449
to a certain standard and also people

00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:19,130
coming to the mailing list I'm not going

00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,509
to know that other people on the list

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,300
are going to be held to a certain

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:26,420
standards well hopefully it's easy

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,889
enough to fix that stuff up and I think

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,870
they're just products of this being a

00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:32,930
relatively new thing for the community

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:36,170
which given time should get better

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,790
a bit more gracefully and at least for

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,040
that broken link as I said I should

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,750
probably try and get that fixed it's

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,360
open source right we see a problem we

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:48,320
try and fix it

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:52,120
so what about Linus himself he's back at

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:56,000
will he spent a little over a month off

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,029
step back from the projects but he's

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,320
back doing his thing now has his

00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:05,810
behavior changed so here's a message of

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,860
his from this December just gone on the

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:12,649
mailing list yeah this is complete

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,110
garbage we have very clear rules your

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:16,700
behavior is entirely out of line and now

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,560
we apparently have a regression that

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,610
goes back to June that I was not told

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,140
about because of your incorrect stance

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,240
so this is quite clearly the message of

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,589
somebody who's upset right you we could

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,050
read between the lines that we can see

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,570
that but it's clearly in comparison that

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,640
with some of his past behavior he does

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,550
now seem to be avoiding personal attacks

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,520
he's saying that the product the code is

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,320
not good and that he wishes this person

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,330
would do something differently in future

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,480
but he is not telling that person that

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:50,839
they are personally a completely wrong

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,370
person or calling them names or doing

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,060
any of that nasty stuff that he was

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,370
doing before so this does seem like a

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,520
bit of a change and a change for the

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,510
better I would say and furthermore this

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,429
proves something else

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:09,439
it proves that patrols are just wrong I

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:11,540
can certainly say that all of the

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,429
slippery slope fear mongers that

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,470
insisted that the introduction of the

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:18,579
Code of Conduct signaled the death knell

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:22,339
for the quality of the Linux kernel are

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:24,410
mistaken Linus is certainly still going

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,150
to tell you if your code or behavior is

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:31,420
not good enough according to his

00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,420
standards okay so they were just wrong

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:39,280
the kernel is now one of over 40,000

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,750
actually I looked and I saw over 50,000

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,580
projects implementing the contributors

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:49,330
covenants I hope that this

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,970
a wider sea change in open-source

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:55,220
culture and community and projects and

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,470
that's one of the reasons that I'm

00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,789
talking about this in this tract not in

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,830
the kernel mini-cons you can help if you

00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,440
are part of an open-source community

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:09,110
that doesn't have a code of conduct and

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,730
you have the leverage to do so because

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,159
let's be honest some of us have more

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,980
leverage than others why don't you

00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:17,990
suggest adding one and once it is added

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,659
make sure that you're helping to enforce

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,720
it you have to walk the walk as well as

00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:25,840
just talk the talk thank you for

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,840
