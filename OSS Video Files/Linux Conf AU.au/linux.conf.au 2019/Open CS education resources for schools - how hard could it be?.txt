Computational Thinking and related topics are appearing in school curricula around the world. There are many barriers to adoption, and one significant one is supporting teachers to find relevant and easy-to-deploy teaching material. This talk will describe experiences with two on-line open resources that have been developed at the University of Canterbury: CS Unplugged, and the CS Field Guide. We will look at principles used to design the resources, and challenges included making it relevant for different cultures, curricula and languages.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
